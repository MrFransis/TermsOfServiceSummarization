Parents should regularly oversee their children\u2019s use of e-mail and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are&nbsp;available from online services and software manufacturers that can help provide a safe online environment for kids. We do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the Service as a condition of participation.

California Online Privacy Protection Act&nbsp;  CalOPPA&nbsp;is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. \u2013 See more at http:\/\/consumercal.org\/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa\/ According to&nbsp;CalOPPA, we agree to the following:  Users can visit our site anonymously.

Fair Information Practices&nbsp;  The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. To&nbsp;be in line with Fair Information Practices we will&nbsp;notify you via email within 7 business days&nbsp;should a data breach occur.&nbsp;We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and\/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about ProtonMail, to send you information related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your ProtonMail account, to verify your ProtonMail account, or to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. The Company is domiciled in Switzerland and all data storage infrastructure is also located solely within Switzerland, and thus governed by the laws and regulations of Switzerland.  You are free, at any given time, to opt-out of those features through the account settings panel. In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of accounts by spam bots or human spammers, ProtonMail uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be asked to verify using either reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided are saved temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer. If this data is saved permanently, it is always saved as a cryptographic hash, which ensures that the raw values cannot be deciphered by us. We also have no technical means to access your encrypted message contents. Account creation: It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, but you may provide an external email address for notification or password recovery purposes.  It is not necessary to provide personal information in order to create an account, Should you choose to provide it, we do associate another email address with your account (for password recovery, or notifications).

Account activity: Due to limitations of the SMTP protocol, we have access to the following email metadata: sender and recipient email addresses, the IP address incoming messages originated from, message subject, and message sent and received times. We do NOT have access to encrypted message content but unencrypted messages sent from external providers to ProtonMail are scanned for Spam and Viruses to pursue the legitimate interest of the protection of our users.

{"plain_text":"We don\u2019t keep your search history and we don\u2019t create an advertising profile to target you. How does Qwant protect your privacy? When you use Qwant as a search engine, we do not set any advertising cookie on your browser, nor do we look at what you personally searched for previously. When you make a query, it is immediately pseudonymized using the methods set forth in this Privacy Policy. We also undertake to make every effort to guarantee the security and confidentiality of our users\u2019 personal data and in particular to prevent such data from being altered, deleted or accessed by unauthorized third parties. The URL of Qwant begins with \u201cHTTPS\u201d, which indicates to users that they are communicating their data securely through the TLS protocol. Technically, the TLS guarantees visitors that their data cannot be intercepted while in transit over the network in a fraudulent or accidental manner. In addition, the padlock that appears in front of the Qwant URL on most browsers certifies that you are browsing a secure site. Qwant has a Privacy office dedicated to protecting your privacy. It also has a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Both work closely with eachother to ensure that the relevant regulation regarding personal data is applied as strongly as it should. The DPO keeps an updated register of all processing of personal data made by Qwant for his services. For instance, when you create an account on the site, you can choose to fill in your profile and this is a processing of personal data for which the register will say how data may be kept (and how long), and who can access it. The DPO makes this register available to anyone who asks : privacy@qwant.com We commit to do anything we can to ensure the security and confidentiality of our users personal data, including by preventing data damage, loss, or access by unauthorized third parties. Qwant\u2019s URL has the HTTPS header that shows users they communicate with Qwant through a secure channel using the TLS protocol. Technically, TLS ensures users that their data can\u2019t be intercepted by fraud. Moreover, the green lock that you see on most browsers when using Qwant certifies that you are browsing a secure website. We use your browser\u2019s \u201clocal storage\u201d technology to store your browser settings (language, enabling or disabling options) on your device. If you change these technical parameters, a cookie may be installed on your browser, exclusively for the purpose of preserving these parameters. You have the possibility to delete the \u201clocal storage\u201d data or the cookie from your browser. However, the provision of a search engine requires some data processing. In such cases, we collect some personal data such as your name, firstname and email address when you register to our services, or when you use forms available on our website. What data is processed by Qwant when you make search queries? Qwant also collects connection\u00a0data, not associated with your search queries, only to ensure the security of its information system and, if you create or modify Boards, to respect the obligation to identify content creators such as mandated by French law (article 6-II de la Loi pour la confiance en l\u2019\u00e9conomie num\u00e9rique).  Even when you are connected with an ID, we don\u2019t use any cookie nor any other tracking device when you browse the site. The only technology that may be installed on your browser, called \u201clocal storage\u201d, is used to locally save your settings (language, activation or deactivation of options\u2026). In order to have knowledge of the existing contents on the Web and to offer you the most relevant results, Qwant automatically indexes Web pages on which personal data of any kind is likely to be present. Qwant retains this data until two years after the last indexing by our robots, based on our legitimate interest in having an index of publicly available content on the Web (article 6.1.f of the GDPR). A salted hash of the user\u2019s IP address with the salt that changes ever three months at the latest (i.e. the result of a mathematical formula based on this IP address, not the IP address itself); Personal data that you transmit are never disclosed or sold by Qwant to third parties, except for job applications that may be shared with recruiting\u00a0partners, unless you ask us not to. After this period, the keywords are no longer associated to an identifier and are retained for 12 months for aggregate statistical analysis (e.g. to know how many times a keyword is searched over a given period of time). This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and meets Qwant\u2019s legitimate interest (article 6.1.f of the GDPR) to secure and make its services reliable. For Qwant and Qwant Junior accounts, your data is removed 7 days after you request that the account be deleted. If you use a EDU Qwant Junior account (edu.qwantjunior.com), your data is removed 3 months after the account deletion request. During this period, you can ask that your account be reactivated using your initial username and password. For data that may be collected when you exercize some rights (access, opposition, rectification, right to be forgotten\u2026), the duration\u00a0of retention depends on what the law prescribes for each of these rights. Please refer to the next section of this Privacy Policy for details. For connection data that the information system security department may access, the\u00a0duration of retention is 6 months. For Qwant Boards, French law makes it mandatory to keep some connection data (e.g. user ID used, URL or position, nature of the operation, time\u2026) for one year. In order to provide you with relevant results from around the world when we do not have the answers to your queries by ourselves, we have partnered with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited to provide a portion of our search results and provide contextual advertising based on the keywords entered and your geographic region. For this purpose, as well as for the security and reliability of our partner\u2019s services (detection of spam, automated activity, fraudulent clicks on ads\u2026), Qwant may transfer to this partner the following pseudonymous data related to your query: \u2013 The searched keywords; \u2013 The type and version of the browser used (User Agent); \u2013 The first three bytes of your IP address; \u2013 The approximate geographical area at the origin of the search, at the scale of a region or a city; \u2013 A salted hash generated from: your IP address, your User Agent and a salt that changes at least every 3 months. This data is transferred to this partner within the European Union, and may be retained in accordance with Bing\u2019s Privacy Policy for a maximum duration of 18 months. This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and responds to the legitimate interest of Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (article 6.1.f) to make its services secure and reliable. Qwant also keeps other data related to your use of the services (associated for 7 days with a hash calculated from your IP address and the User Agent of your browser) including : \u2013 The source of the user\u2019s visit to the site (the HTTP referrer and the search field used to trigger the request); Qwant does not require you to register to use the search engine. However, you may wish to register to log in and personalize services. You are free to manage your account information (modify, correct, update and delete information). In order to manage its users\u2019 accounts and to send our newsletter (if you have chosen to subscribe), Qwant collects the following data: When you use Qwant, no personal information whatsoever is neither captured or transmitted to advertisers. In details: \u2013 No third party cookies \u2013 No trackers \u2013 No behavioral targeting \u2013 No campaigns mixing legit and promotional content (native advertising) the right to object to processing under the conditions provided for by the regulations (article 21 of the GDPR); \u2013 the right to limit the processing of such data under the conditions provided for by the regulations (article 18 of the GDPR); right to data portability (Article 20 of the GDPR); Right to erasure and \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d. This right gives you the possibility to have your data deleted as soon as possible by Qwant. Concretely, you have the possibility to delete your account by following instructions detailed here. As of the request to close the account, the data you have provided will then be deleted after 7 days, subject to our legal and regulatory obligations.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.  You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.  Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. In the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute. This notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it. You must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.  The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.  Binding Arbitration. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.  To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost. Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney\u2019s fees. Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.  If Discord\u2019s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.  You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.  Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com. The notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service. If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either. If any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.  Survival. This Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.

CLASS WAIVER THIS SECTION AND THE PREVIOUS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.  PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.  Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.  The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Discord customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.

{"plain_text":"Your searches are encrypted We protect your searches from potential eavesdroppers with a securely encrypted connection. This way we make sure that nobody between you and us can see your searches.  We do not, and never will, share or sell any data we collect ourselves with any third party. We remove parts of the IP address when we store it so they become anonymous. For example 192.168.152.223 becomes 192.168.XXX.XXX We do not use unique event fingerprinting We send all data collected from Ecosia services over an SSL-secured connection We store all analytics data in an highly encrypted database We only keep fully anonymised search data after 7 days  We only keep fully anonymised search data after 7 days  If you have \"Do Not Track\" enabled in your browser settings we do not collect any analytics data. Ecosia\u2019s servers are located around the world in order to provide a fast response no matter where you are. However, when you perform a search on Ecosia, your request will generally be routed to the server that is geographically nearest to you. That means, for example, if you are located in Germany your search traffic will remain within Germany and will fall under strict German privacy regulations. We also save the searches we receive to filter spam. Information stored in our cookies include:  Your country and language settings Whether or not you have installed an extension The value of your search counter Your adult filter settings The timestamp of your last search  Your Bing Client ID (if enabled) In some cases which way you have found out about Ecosia We do not store any personal information in the cookie. After 7 days we remove all personal information (like the IP address) from the search data we collect ourselves. We will never share your searches with anyone except services that are directly involved in answering your search request, like Bing. Ecosia does use third party tools on non-search pages where absolutely necessary to help us understand and tune our marketing campaigns. For example, we may run an ad campaign on a social media site that requires us to share some data about user activity in order to help us understand how effective that campaign is. For more information on how Bing handles your data see their privacy policy. There are only a few search engines with their own web index - for example Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. Most other general web search engines cooperate and share data with these companies in some form. We currently work with Bing and are very transparent about what we share with them. Beyond that, no search engine can ever provide perfect protection of your search data, because other parties \u2013 like your network provider or browser for example \u2013 might still be able to access some of your data.
