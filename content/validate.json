What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?  Like most websites, nextcloud.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.  nextcloud.com does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information to third parties unless legally obliged to do so. We honour the do-not-track directive. nextcloud.com will not track anything if this is enabled.

The Play Store version equal to or newer than 1.5.0 for Nextcloud supports push notifications which use the Google servers. However Google does not have access to the actual notification data. Only a header with a subject is sent via Google, but in encrypted form, and the rest of the content is retrieved directly from your Nextcloud server and not sent through Google.

We try to drop all home\/private users from the database as soon as we find out they are private users, of course after we have sent them the white paper they asked for. For example, we remove contacts with an @gmail or @icloud address and keep obviously business related addresses (@acme @example-ltd @placeholder-corp.com). For those we then might follow up on a End-to-end Encryption white paper download a week later with an offer to download our Server-side Encryption white paper.
