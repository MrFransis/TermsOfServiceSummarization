FAA.\n<strong>This agreement, however, does not prevent you from bringing any issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.</strong>\n</p> Arbitration Scope, Rules &amp.\nRequirements\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and discovery and court review of an arbitration award are limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these <em>Terms of Use</em> as a court would.</p>\n<p>The arbitration or small claims court action shall occur in the United States in the county or parish in which you reside or at such other location in the United States which may be agreed upon by you and us.\nYou may also choose to have any arbitration, whether commenced by you or us, conducted by telephone or based on written submissions only.\n</p>\n<p>The arbitrator has the authority to and shall resolve all claims and issues arising between us, including, but not limited to, international, federal, state, and local statutory, regulatory, constitutional, and common law claims.\n</p>\n<p>This arbitration requirement covers, but is not limited to, any and all claims arising from or related in any way to your use of the Sites, your registration with the Sites, your requests to receive advertising or promotions, your purchase of or attempt to purchase products from us, and your communications with us.\n</p>\n<p>The arbitrator also has the sole authority to and shall address all claims or arguments by both parties concerning the formation, legality, and enforceability of this arbitration clause, the scope of this clause, and the arbitrability of any claim or issue arising between us.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Any arbitration will be held before a single neutral arbitrator and will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Consumer Due Process Protocol (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") as currently in effect, and as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at https://www.adr.org/consumer, by calling the AAA at 800-778-7879, or by writing to the AAA Notice Address set forth below.\nTo the extent that there is a conflict between this clause and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator shall resolve such conflicts so as to preserve the parties\u2019 mutual obligation to arbitrate claims on an individual basis.\n</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to the AAA and to: Venus Fashion, Inc., Attention Legal Dept, 11711 Marco Beach Drive, Jacksonville, FL 32224.\nThe AAA\u2019s address is: American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 (the \u201cAAA Notice Address\u201d).\nYou may also send a copy to the AAA online at https://www.adr.org.\n</p>\n<p>If you initiate an arbitration, we will reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may be required under the AAA Rules for claims under $10,000.\nFor claims over $10,000, payment of such fees will be by a separate agreement between you and us.\nIf we cannot agree on such payment, the arbitrator will decide how such fees should be paid and by whom.\nEach party shall be responsible for their own attorneys\u2019 fees except as provided by applicable law or the AAA Rules.\n</p>\n<p>We are committed to providing for dispute resolution at a reasonable cost to consumers consistent with the AAA Rules, and any matters related to such cost, if not agreed to by you and us, will be decided by the arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p>To the extent that any other provision of the <em>Terms of Use</em> is found to be inconsistent with rights, duties, and requirements of this arbitration agreement, or where the application of such a provision would change or render unenforceable any part of this arbitration agreement, such provision shall be null and void and the terms of this arbitration agreement shall control.\n</p> Jurisdiction <p> These <em>Terms of Use</em> shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to any conflict of law provisions.\nAny dispute arising under these <em>Terms of Use</em> shall be resolved exclusively by an appropriate federal or state court sitting in the State of Florida.\nThe waiver of any provision of these <em>Terms of Use</em> shall not be considered a waiver of any other provision or of Venus Fashion Inc.\u2019s right to require strict observance of each of the terms herein.\nIf any provision of these <em>Terms of Use</em> is found to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, that provision shall be severable, and all other provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\nThese <em>Terms of Use</em>, together with our posted Privacy Statement, constitute the entire agreement between us relating to your use of our website.\n</p> Effective Date &amp.\nSupplemental Terms <p>\nThis agreement was last updated on October 6, 2020 and applies to all uses, purchases, or registrations occurring after that date.\nUpdates to these <em>Terms of Use</em> shall not apply retroactively.\nIf any provision of these <em>Terms of Use</em> is found to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be removed and the remaining <em>Terms of Use</em> shall be fully enforceable.\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-05-01 21:54:23.126217",
