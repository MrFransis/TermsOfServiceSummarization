3/28/17)</p>\n<p>Our Terms of Service contain important information about your legal rights.\nTo make it easier to understand, we have provided summaries and tips in these gray boxes.\nThese summaries are not part of the official terms, and it is important for you to read the language in each section carefully.</p>\n1.\nThis Agreement\n<p>\n<strong>Summary:&nbsp;</strong>You agree to follow some basic rules when using Meetup\u2019s Platform.\nThese rules are described in these Terms of Service, including the related policies and guidelines discussed below.\nWe may change these rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.1 The Agreement.</strong> Meetup enables you and other members to arrange offline, real-world Meetup groups and Meetup events.\nThe terms \u201cMeetup,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d include Meetup, Inc.\nand our corporate parent, affiliates, or subsidiaries.\nWe use the terms \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d to mean any person using our Platform, and any organization or person using the Platform on an organization\u2019s behalf.\nWe use the word \u201cPlatform\u201d to mean any website, application, or service offered by Meetup, including content we offer and electronic communications we send.\nWe provide our Platform to you subject to these Terms of Service.\nWe use the terms \u201cTerms of Service\u201d and

Restrictions,&nbsp;Payment Policies, Trademark Usage Guidelines, and API License Terms.\nYour use of the Platform signifies that you agree to this Agreement.\nIf you are using the Platform for an organization, you agree to this Agreement on behalf of that organization, and represent you have authority to bind that organization to the terms contained in this Agreement.\nIf you do not or are unable to agree to this Agreement, do not use our Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> We have included summaries and tips to provide an overview of some legal concepts and answer common questions, but the text of these summaries and tips are for your convenience only and do not have a legal effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> These Terms of Service are an agreement between you and Meetup and not between you and any other member.\nFor more information, see our&nbsp;FAQ page explaining the parties to our Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2 Revisions to this Agreement.</strong> We may modify this Agreement from time to time.\nWhen we do, we will provide notice to you by publishing the most current version and revising the date at the top of this page.\nIf we make any material change to this Agreement, we will provide additional notice to you, such as by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice on our Platform.\nBy continuing to use the Platform after any changes come into effect, you agree to the revised Agreement.\nIf you do not wish to accept the revised Agreement, you can close your account.\n</p>\n2.\nYour Account and Membership\n<p>\n<strong>Summary:</strong> You need to be at least 18 years old to use our Platform.\nMeetup organizers control the Content and membership of their Meetup groups.\nHowever, we may remove any Content you post or terminate your account at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 Eligibility.</strong> Our Platform is available to anyone who is at least 18 years old.\nYou represent that you are at least 18.\nAdditional eligibility requirements for a particular portion of our Platform may be set by any member who has the ability to moderate or manage that portion of our Platform.\nFor example, the eligibility requirements for a Meetup group or Meetup event may be set by the organizers of that group.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2 Modification, Suspension, and Termination of Your Account.</strong> We may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform if, in our sole discretion, we determine that you have violated this Agreement, including any of the policies or guidelines that are part of this Agreement, that it is in the best interest of the Meetup community, or to protect our brand or Platform.\nWhen this happens, we will notify you of the reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination.\nWe also may remove accounts of members who are inactive for an extended period of time.\nPlease email policy@meetup.com if you believe the modification, suspension, or termination has occurred in error.</p>\n<p>A member who has the ability to moderate or manage a particular portion of our Platform also has the ability, in his or her sole discretion, to modify, suspend, or terminate your access to that portion of the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Account Information and Security.</strong> When you register, you provide us with some basic information, including an email address and a password.\nKeep your email address and other account information current and accurate.\nAlso, you agree to maintain the security and confidentiality of your password (or else we may need to disable your account).\nWe strongly encourage you to choose a strong and unique password that is not shared with any other account or online service and practice other healthy password security habits to help avoid unauthorized access to your account.\nYou alone are responsible for anything that happens from your failure to maintain that security and confidentiality, such as by sharing your account credentials with others.\nIf someone is using your password or accessing your account without your permission, email us at abuse@meetup.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 License to the Meetup Platform and Services</strong>.\nSubject to your compliance with this Agreement, Meetup grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable, non-transferable right to use the Platform in order to access and use the services and features that we make available to you.</p>\n3.\nFees, Payments, and Offers\n<p>\n<strong>Summary:</strong> We charge for certain features on our Platform.\nIf you\u2019re a Meetup group organizer, you\u2019re responsible for paying for organizer subscription fees related to your Meetup group.\nThese fees are billed on a regular and recurring basis (unless you disable auto-renewal or cancel your subscription), and may change in the future.\nAdditionally, some organizers charge money for participation in a Meetup group or Meetup event.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1 Fees Charged by Meetup.</strong> Use of some of the features on our Platform is free, and we charge fees for other features.\nWe may in the future implement a new fee, or modify an existing fee, for certain current or future features of our Platform.\nIf we implement a new or modified fee, we will give you notice in advance such as by posting changes on our Platform or sending you an email.\nYou agree to pay those fees and any associated taxes for your continued use of the applicable service.\nUnless otherwise stated, all fees and all transactions are in U.S.\ndollars.\nOrganizer subscriptions are non-transferable.\nMembers based in the European Union may cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our Platform.\nHowever, if you use the service, you may be charged for services provided during this 14-day period.\nPlease note that this 14-day period begins when the service starts even if you are using a free trial.\nUsers based in the European Union can exercise their cancellation right by emailing us at policy@meetup.com.\nSee the model cancellation form here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2 Fees Charged by Organizers.</strong> Organizers may impose fees related to particular portions of the Platform, such as member dues for a Meetup group or an event fee for a Meetup event.\nWe reserve the right to initiate refunds of fees paid to organizers, when appropriate, even in cases of fees paid through a third-party payment service.\nRefunds that we initiate, if any, will be governed by our&nbsp;Payment Policies.\nOrganizers may also have their own refund policies, so long as they are consistent with and do not limit members\u2019 ability to receive refunds under our&nbsp;Payment Policies.\nPayments made to organizers via the Platform are made through a third-party payment service provider.\nIf a member pays a fee to an organizer via the Platform, the member authorizes the organizer (and the organizer\u2019s applicable payment service provider) to charge the designated payment method for the total amount of the fees, including any applicable taxes and other charges.\nCertain types of fees charged by organizers may be billed on a recurring basis.\nIf billed on a recurring basis, you authorize the organizer to charge the applicable fee to the designated payment method.\nYou may cancel auto-renewal at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> You should use common sense in deciding whether to make a payment to any organizer.\nWe cannot ensure that organizers will use payments as they promise or as you expect.\nYou should check the refund policy of the Meetup group before making any payments to an organizer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3 Payments to Meetup.</strong> Organizers are responsible for paying subscription and any other applicable fees to Meetup on time and through our approved payment methods.\nOrganizers who allow their organizer subscription to lapse are subject to removal as the organizer of the Meetup groups associated with their account, and their Meetup group (along with all of the information and Content associated with or posted to that Meetup group) may be terminated or transferred to another member.\nYou may only pay organizer fees to Meetup using a valid payment method acceptable to us, as specified via the Platform.\nIf we terminate, suspend, or remove your account in connection with violation of this Agreement, we are not obligated to refund any organizer subscription fees paid to Meetup.\nIn addition, if you paid your organizer fees through the Meetup app for iOS, your payment is subject to the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, and you will need to submit your request for a refund to Apple.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Platform.\nYou authorize us (and our designated third-party payment processors) to charge your designated payment method for the total amount of any fees you owe to Meetup, including any applicable taxes and other charges.\nIf the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your payment may be suspended or cancelled.\nWe reserve the right to adjust, or to instruct our payment processors to make adjustments to a payment that has already been requested or received, in order to correct errors or mistakes, or to issue refunds, in accordance with our&nbsp;Payment Policies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> To learn more about organizer subscriptions and what happens if they expire, see this&nbsp;FAQ on Expired Plans.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.4 Automatic Subscription Renewals.</strong> Fees for certain aspects of our Platform may be billed on either a recurring basis or on a one-time basis.\nIf billed on a recurring basis, the fees are payable in advance of the applicable period specified via the Platform with no refunds.\nWe will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation.\nBy purchasing any feature or other aspect of our Platform for which we charge, you authorize us to keep your payment current by charging the applicable fee to your credit card account (or any other means of payment used by you).\nWhile you may cancel auto-renewal or cancel your subscription at any time, refunds will be issued solely pursuant to our Subscription Refund Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> To cancel your organizer subscription, see this&nbsp;FAQ on Modifying Subscriptions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.5 Free Trials.</strong> We may offer free trials of subscriptions and other products on our Platform.\nWe will inform you of the length of the free trial, your renewal period, and the date and amount of your first payment.\nAfter your free trial ends, your paid subscription will begin and we will automatically bill you for each renewal period until cancellation.\nYou can cancel automatic subscription renewals at any time according to the terms and procedures described above.\nUsers based in the European Union are entitled to cancel with a full refund within 14 days after signing up to our Platform by emailing us at policy@meetup.com.\nSee the model cancellation form here.\nPlease note that this 14-day period begins when the free trial starts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.6 Third Party Payment Processors.</strong> An organizer that uses the Platform to accept payments from other members must comply with the terms and conditions of the third party provider of the applicable payment service used to receive the payment.\nMeetup does not provide those payment services, is not a party to your agreement with the applicable third-party provider, and will not be liable or responsible for your use of those third-party payment services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.7 Invoices from Third Parties.</strong> In line with the tax laws of the country where an organizer is using the Platform, an organizer may receive Meetup invoices from a third party provider.\nSuch third party provider invoicing does not in any way impact the rights and obligations agreed to in this Agreement, nor does it impact the fee being charged for the use of the Platform.</p>\n4.\nYour Content and Privacy\n<p>\n<strong>Summary:</strong> You are responsible for the Content you post on our Platform or send to us.\nYou give us a license to use this Content to operate, improve, promote, and protect Meetup and our Platform.\nOur&nbsp;Privacy

information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.1 Your Content.\n</strong>You are responsible for the Content that you post to the Platform or otherwise provide to Meetup.\nWe use the word \u201cContent\u201d to mean the information, material, and any other content that you post to the Platform or otherwise send to us.\nExamples of your Content include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The material that organizers and members typically post to the Platform, such as information about Meetup groups and Meetup events, comments, and photos;</li>\n<li>All feedback, suggestions, and other communications that you send or direct to Meetup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By being responsible for your Content, you agree, among other things, that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have all the permissions, rights, and licenses needed (including under

Policies, Trademark Usage Guidelines, and API License Terms.\nYou also agree that we may remove the metadata associated with your Content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> Search engines can see public areas of the Platform.\nYour Content within these areas, such as the name and location that you provide during registration, and your membership in public Meetup groups, may appear in search results.\nOur Platform is designed so that search engines cannot see your Content that is within restricted areas of the Platform, such as private Meetup groups.\nYou can find additional information on our&nbsp;FAQ about Search Engine Visibility.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 Content License from You.</strong> We do not claim ownership of your Content.\nHowever, to enable us to operate, improve, promote, and protect Meetup and our Platform, and to ensure we do not violate any rights you may have in your Content, you hereby grant Meetup a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license (including a waiver of any moral rights) to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, publish, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and create derivative works of, your Content and to commercialize and exploit the copyright, trademark, publicity, and database rights you have in your Content.\nThis license would permit your Content to remain on the Platform, even after you cease to be a member of a Meetup group or of the Platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> This license doesn\u2019t give us ownership of any of your Content.\nIt simply gives us and members the right to use it on or related to the Platform.\nThis license continues even if you close your account, because it\u2019s necessary for us to operate the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3 Privacy.</strong> Meetup collects registration and other information about you through our Platform.\nPlease refer to our&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cookie Policy&nbsp;for details on how we collect, use, and disclose this information.\nThese policies do not govern use of information that you provide to third parties, such as to organizers and other members of Meetup\u2019s Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tip:</strong> Meetup has no control over how other members may use information that you provide to them, so you should exercise common sense and good judgment when sharing information with others on our Platform.</p>\n5.\nYour Use of Our Platform\n<p>\n<strong>Summary:</strong> We require that you follow our policies and guidelines when using

access to and use of some areas or features of the Platform may be subject to additional terms, policies, standards or guidelines (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d).\nYou may be required to accept these Additional Terms before you can access these Platform areas and features.\nIf there is a conflict between the Terms of Service and the Additional Terms, those Additional Terms will govern your access to and use of that Platform area or feature, unless otherwise specified in the Additional Terms.</p>\n<p>When the Platform uses third party services to provide certain features and services for our members, our members may be required to comply with the terms of service that apply to these features and services.\nFor example, some areas of our Platform feature mapping services provided by Google Maps and Google Earth.\nWhen you use these mapping services on the Platform, you agree to be bound by the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>If you do not comply, we may modify, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the Platform, in our sole discretion, and we will provide you with reasons for the modification, suspension, or termination.\nPlease email policy@meetup.com if you believe the modification, suspension, or termination has occurred in error.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 Content of Others.</strong> Meetup does not control the Content of other

action.&nbsp;Members based in the European Union may have additional or different rights, as provided by applicable law.\nMeetup has no obligation to get involved with any disputes you have with other

all members, except for members who are based in the European Union.\nSection 9.6 sets out the dispute resolution procedures that apply to members who are based in the European Union.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nMandatory Arbitration.\n</strong>Except as set forth in Section 9.3, you agree to submit any claim to JAMS, Inc., or its successor (\u201cJAMS\u201d) for final and binding arbitration.&nbsp;In arbitration, certain rights that you or we would have in court may not be available, such as discovery or appeal.\nYou and Meetup are each expressly waiving any right to trial by judge or jury in a court of law.&nbsp;This agreement to arbitrate shall apply regardless of whether the claim arises during or after any termination of this Agreement or your relationship with Meetup.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nArbitration Time for Filing.</strong> Any claim subject to arbitration must be filed within one year after the date the party asserting the claim first knows or should know of the act, omission or default giving rise to the claim, or the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nArbitration Procedures.</strong> Either party may commence arbitration by filing a written demand for arbitration with JAMS, with a copy to the other party according to the notice procedures in Section 11.2.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in accordance with&nbsp;JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures&nbsp;and any other applicable rules that JAMS requires (\u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) that are in effect as of the demand for arbitration.\nYou agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place in New York County, New York or elsewhere as required by JAMS Rules.\nYour responsibility to pay any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules.\nThe parties will cooperate with JAMS and each other in scheduling the arbitration proceedings, and in selecting one arbitrator from the appropriate JAMS list with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall follow this Agreement and, to the extent permitted by JAMS Rules, can award costs, fees, and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, to the prevailing party, except that the arbitrator shall not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3 Exceptions.</strong> You or Meetup may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any U.S.\ncounty where you live or work.\nYou or Meetup may seek injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York as necessary to protect the intellectual property rights of you or Meetup pending the completion of arbitration.\nMeetup may take action in court or arbitration to collect any fees or recover damages for, or to seek injunctive relief relating to, Platform operations, or unauthorized use of our Platform or intellectual property.\nNothing in this Section 9 shall diminish Meetup\u2019s right to modify, suspend or terminate your account or access to our Platform under Section 2.2.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4 Arbitration Opt Out.</strong>\n<strong>You may decline to resolve disputes through arbitration by emailing us at arbitration-opt-out@meetup.com within 30 days of the date you first agree to this Agreement.</strong>&nbsp;Your email must include your full name, residential address, the email address registered to your Meetup account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of arbitration.\nIf you opt out according to this process, then Section 9.2 of this Agreement does not apply to you.\nThis opt-out does not affect any other sections of this Agreement, such as Sections 9.3 (Exceptions), 9.5 (Class Action Waiver), 11.5 (Governing Law), 11.6 (Judicial Forum), and 11.7 (Time for Filing).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.5 Class Action Waiver.</strong> You agree to resolve disputes with Meetup on an individual basis.\nYou agree not to bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.&nbsp;<strong>You are expressly waiving any right to participate in class actions, class arbitrations, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.6 Dispute Resolution Terms Applicable to Members Based in the EU.</strong> If you are a member based in the European Union, the mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident will apply.\nNothing in this Agreement will affect your rights as a consumer to rely on the mandatory provisions of the local law that applies.\nIf you are based in the European Union, the local laws in your European Union Member State may allow you to take legal action against Meetup in your Member State and to invoke certain local laws against Meetup.\nThe European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform.</p>\n10.\nIntellectual Property\n<p>\n<strong>Summary:</strong> If you use Meetup\u2019s trademark, be
