RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF SUCH USE.\nTP-LINK IS NOT AN INSURER.\nYOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING INSURANCE COVERING ALL LOSS, DAMAGE, OR EXPENSE, WHETHER FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY (INCLUDING DEATH), ECONOMIC LOSSES, OR ANY OTHER FORM OF LOSS, DAMAGE, OR EXPENSE ARISING OUT OF OR FROM (I) THESE TERMS, OR (II) THE SERVICES.</p>\n<p>TP-Link is

any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses, and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any third-party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third-party using your account), (b) your violation of these Terms, and (c) your intentional infringement of third-party intellectual

law, with the exception of disputes pertaining to TP-Links\u2019 intellectual property rights and certain statutory claims that, pursuant to law, are not arbitrable, any dispute of any kind between you and TP-Link arising under these Terms shall be resolved through binding arbitration pursuant to the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures on an individual basis with no class relief.\nThe arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice of any California state or federal court with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow California substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this Section shall be construed as a \u201cwritten agreement to arbitrate\u201d pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).&nbsp;You and&nbsp;we&nbsp;agree that we intend that this Section&nbsp;satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the FAA.\nThe hearing shall be conducted in the county that encompasses the billing address you have provided to TP-Link.\nFor any claim in which you seek U.S.\n$10,000.00 or less, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person, by telephone, or instead the arbitrator may decide the dispute without a hearing.\nFor those claims that the arbitrator determines are not frivolous, TP-Link shall pay the costs and fees of JAMS and the arbitrator.&nbsp.\nTP-Link agrees that it will not seek reimbursement from you for its costs and fees incurred by it in the arbitration.\nAGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>All non-arbitrable disputes in connection with these Terms shall be governed by, construed

that we may retain copies of such User Content indefinitely.\nIn the event that we elect to terminate your account, we will try to provide advance notice to you prior to termination so that you are able to retrieve any important User Content stored in your account.\nYou understand and agree that we may provide no advanced notice for any reason, but usually because it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone's safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of TP-Link.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Product Specifications, Pricing, Typographical Errors</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do our best to describe every product or service offered on the Services as accurately as possible.\nHowever, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant those product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Services is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.\nIn the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, TP-Link shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion.\nIf we charged your credit card or other accounts prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your account in the amount of the charge.\nAdditional Terms may apply.\nIf a product you purchased from TP-Link is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any usernames and passwords used for the Services are for individual use only.\nYou shall be responsible for the security of your username and password (if any).\nTP-Link shall be entitled to monitor your username and password and, at its discretion, require you to change it.\nIf you use a username and password that TP-Link considers insecure, TP-Link will be entitled to require your username or password to be changed and/or terminate your account.\nHowever, TP-Link cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.\nYou acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.\nYou agree to immediately notify TP-Link of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your account or any other breach of security of which you become aware.\nTP-Link is not liable to you for any loss or damage

release your details to system administrators at other sites, law enforcement and/or governmental authorities in order to assist them in resolving security incidents.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Investigations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>TP-Link reserves the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms, including without limitation, any violation arising from any submission, posting or emails you make or send to any Forum.\nTP-Link may seek to gather information from the user who is suspected of violating these Terms and from any other user.\nTP-Link may suspend any users whose conduct or postings are under investigation and may remove such material from its servers as it deems appropriate and without notice.\nIf TP-Link believes, in its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms has occurred, it may edit or modify any submission, posting or emails, remove the material permanently, cancel postings, warn users, suspend users and passwords, terminate accounts, or take other corrective action it deems appropriate.\nTP-Link will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing TP-Link to disclose the identity of anyone posting any emails, or publishing or otherwise making available any materials that are believed to violate these Terms.\nBY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS ALL MEMBERS OF THE TP-LINK GROUP FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY MEMBER OF THE TP-LINK GROUP DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND/OR FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUNCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY EITHER A MEMBER OF THE TP-LINK GROUP OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Warranty Disclaimer</strong>\n</p>\n<p>YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR
