interest in our enterprise.\nData protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the Vincent Photography.\nThe use of the Internet pages of the Vincent Photography is possible without any indication of personal data.\nhowever, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>\n<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Vincent Photography.\nBy means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.\nFurthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>\n<p>As the controller, the Vincent Photography has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.\nHowever, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.\nFor this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g.\nby telephone.\n</p> 1.\nDefinitions <p>The data protection declaration of the Vincent Photography is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nOur data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners.\nTo ensure this, we

preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>f) Pseudonymisation <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing <p>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the

Third party <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>k) Consent <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 2.\nName and Address of the controller <p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: </p>\n<p>Vincent Photography</p>\n<p>Sandstr.\n5</p>\n<p>82110 Germering</p>\n<p>Germany</p>\n<p>Phone: +49 176-15528046</p>\n<p>Email:

be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>\n<p>When using these general data and information, the Vincent Photography does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, the Vincent Photography analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p> 4.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data <p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>\n<p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a

have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p>\n<p>If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>c) Right to rectification <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the

subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.</li>\n<li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>\n<li>The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the

wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the Vincent Photography, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller.\nThe employee of the Vincent Photography will arrange the restriction of the processing.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>f) Right to data portability <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nHe or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>\n<p>In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the Vincent

time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.\nThis also applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>\n<p>The Vincent Photography shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>\n<p>If the Vincent Photography processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.\nThis applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such

Twitter may be accessed under https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en.</p> 9.\nLegal basis for the processing <p>Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIs our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary
