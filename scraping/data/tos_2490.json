provide information to MSK using the Sites.\nPersonal Data about individuals located in the European Union or European Economic Area (generally referred to here as the \u201cEU\u201d) are subject to special protections under EU law when the processing of those data are within the scope of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nThis Website Notice to Individuals Located in the EU/EEA (the \u201cEU Website Notice\u201d) applies to MSK\u2019s processing of Personal Data that is within the scope of the GDPR, which we call collectively the \u201cEEA Processing Activities.\u201d The EU Website Notice applies only to EEA Processing Activities involving Personal Data collected through the Sites.\nWhen you use the Sites to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in the United States for EEA Processing Activities, MSK is a controller of this Personal Data.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that if you use the Sites to transfer your Personal Data to MSK in order to seek care at an MSK facility or a second opinion at MSK, you will be provided a copy of our EU Patient Notice and our Notice of Privacy Practices, which will govern our use of protected health information.\nThe EU Website Notice will not apply to MSK\u2019s use of such information.</p>\n<p>We rely on separate and overlapping bases to process your Personal Data lawfully.\nMSK will use the Personal Data transferred or collected on the Sites only for the purposes described in this Website Privacy Policy.\nMSK\u2019s legal bases for processing your Personal Data include providing you with the information or services that you have requested, protecting your vital interests, furthering our legitimate interests, and your consent, if applicable.\nWhen we process special categories of

occupational medicine or assessment of the working capacity of our workforce, carrying out our obligations under employment or social protection laws, and your consent, if applicable.\nLegitimate interests that we rely on in processing your Personal Data include (i) improving and customizing the Sites for you, (ii) understanding how the Sites are being used, (iii) exploring ways to develop and grow our operations, (iv) ensuring the safety and security of the Sites, and (v) enhancing protection against fraud, spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime and security risks.\nWithout the ability to collect and process your Personal Information, MSK would not be able to achieve those interests.\nWe may also use your Personal Data for purposes, including scientific research, that are compatible with the purposes for which such data were initially collected.</p>\n<p>If our processing is based solely on consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent.\nYou may withdraw your consent by contacting us as set forth in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below.\nPlease note that, in certain cases, we may continue to process your Personal Data after you have

that the European Commission has determined to provide adequate data protection, (ii) obtaining your consent to transfer your Personal Data outside the EU after first informing you about the possible risks of such a transfer, (iii) transferring your information outside the EU if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between you and MSK, including to provide treatment to you, or if the transfer is necessary to the performance of a contract between your physician or other health care provider located in the EU, and the contract was entered into in your interest, (iv) transferring your information outside the EU if necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or (v) transferring your Personal Data outside the EU to protect your vital interests.</p>\n<p>We will retain your Personal Data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Website Privacy Policy (for example, if you have an account, for as long as your

purposes of public health or to preserve the integrity of a research study, or to allow itself to defend itself from legal claims, and (6) file a complaint with a data protection authority (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm).\nIf you have questions about the processing of your Personal Data or rights associated with

order to treat your condition, obtain payment for that treatment, and run our business operations.&nbsp.\nIn some cases, we may also disclose your health information for payment activities and certain business operations of another health care provider or payor.&nbsp.\nWe can do all of these things without obtaining your authorization.&nbsp.\nBelow are further examples of how your information may be used and disclosed for these purposes.</p> Treatment <p>We may share your health information with doctors, nurses or other staff at any of our locations who are involved in taking care of you, and they may in turn use that information to diagnose or treat you.&nbsp.\nAn MSKCC doctor may share your health information with another MSKCC doctor, or with a non-MSKCC doctor, to determine how to diagnose or treat you.&nbsp.\nYour MSKCC doctor may also share your health information with another doctor to whom you have been referred for further health care.\n&nbsp;If you are a bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell donor or recipient, your information may also become part of your recipient/donor\u2019s medical record.</p> Payment <p>We may use your health information or share it with others to obtain payment for your health care services.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may share information about you with your health insurance company in order to obtain reimbursement after we have treated you, or to determine whether it will cover your treatment.&nbsp.\nWe might also need to inform your health insurance company about your health condition in order to obtain pre-approval for your treatment, such as admitting you to the hospital for a particular type of surgery.&nbsp.\nWe also may share your information with other health care providers and payors for their payment activities.</p> Business Operations <p>We may use your health information or share it with others in order to conduct our business operations.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may use your health information to evaluate the performance of our staff in caring for you, or to educate our staff on how to improve the care they provide to you.&nbsp.\nWe also may share your health information with other health care providers and payors for certain of their business operations if the information is related to a relationship the provider or payor currently has or previously had with you, and if the provider or payor is required by federal law to protect the privacy of your health information.</p> Appointment Reminders, Treatment Alternatives, Benefits and Services <p>In the course of providing treatment to you, we may use your health information to contact you with a reminder that you have an appointment for treatment or services at our facility.&nbsp.\nWe may also use your health information in order to recommend possible treatment alternatives or health-related benefits and services that may be of interest to you.</p> Fundraising <p>To support our business operations, we may use demographic and other information about you, including your name, where you live or work, your health insurance status, your age and gender, the dates that you received treatment, the name of your treating physician and department, and certain information about the outcome of your treatment, in order to contact you to raise money to help us operate.&nbsp.\nWe may also share this information with an MSKCC-related charitable foundation or with our business associates (described further below) who may contact you to raise money on our behalf.\n&nbsp;You have the right to opt-out of receiving these fundraising communications at any time.&nbsp.\nYou may exercise your opt-out right by contacting the Privacy Office at 646-227-2056 or by email at privacy@mskcc.org.</p> Business Associates <p>We may disclose your health information to contractors, agents and other business associates who need the information in order to assist us with obtaining payment or carrying out our business operations.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may share your health information with a billing company that helps us to obtain payment from your insurance company.&nbsp.\nAnother example is that we may share your health information with an accounting firm or law firm that provides professional advice to us about how to improve our health care services and comply with the law.&nbsp.\nIf we do disclose your health information to a business associate, we will have a written contract to ensure that our business associate also protects the privacy of your health information.</p> Partially De-identified Information \u2013 Limited Data Set <p>We are also permitted to use and disclose \u201cpartially de-identified\u201d health information about you (known as a \u201cLimited Data Set\u201d) if the person who will receive the information signs an agreement to protect the privacy of the information as required by federal and state law.&nbsp.\nPartially de-identified health information will <em>not</em> contain any information that would directly identify you (such as your name, street address, social security number, phone number, fax number, electronic mail address, website address, or license number).</p> Research <p>All research projects conducted by MSKCC are approved through a special review process to protect patient safety, welfare and confidentiality.&nbsp.\nIn most cases, we will ask for your written authorization before using your health information or sharing it with others in order to conduct research.&nbsp.\nHowever, under some circumstances, we are permitted to use your medical information for research without your authorization, if we get approval from a special review board.&nbsp.\nThese studies will not affect your treatment or welfare, and your medical information will continue to be protected.&nbsp.\nFor example, the research project may involve comparing the health and recovery of patients with the same type of disease who received one medication to those who received another.&nbsp.\nIn those instances, there will be no disclosure of your protected health information to outside parties, unless required by law, subject to a Limited Data Set (described above), or if we have obtained your permission.&nbsp.\nIn addition, because a major part of our mission is research, we may use your protected health information for creating databanks, outcome reviews and screening for eligibility for participation in clinical trials.&nbsp.\nIn these instances, there will be no disclosure of your identified protected health information to outside parties except as a Limited Data Set (described above) or if required by law.</p>\n", "created_at": "2021-01-01 22:45:10.032388", "updated_at": "2021-02-03 22:41:16.970836"}, {"id": 3396, "name": "Changes to
