the violating content from your server.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul> Fair Use Policy <ul>\n<li>Services provided by us are not explicitly limited by bandwidth, CPU or disk space.\nhowever, we have some restrictions.</li>\n<li>Disk space is 'unlimited' for the purpose of storing material related to your service.\n100 GB of user data is acceptable.\nHundreds of copyrighted music, movies or games are not.</li>\n<li>If your service uses an excessive amount of bandwidth or CPU for prolonged periods, we will send you warnings via email.\nIf you don't fix the problem, we may suspend your service.</li>\n<li>If your service is using an excessive amount of disk space, we may thoroughly investigate your storage.\nIf you are found to be using excessive disk space for material not related to your service, we will send you warnings via email.\nIf you don't fix the problem, we'll start deleting files irrelevant to your service.</li>\n<li>Each client may only store a maximum of 3 backups of their service at one time.\nAny additional backups must be stored externally.</li>\n<li>The total size of all backups under your account should not exceed 15GB.\nAny additional backups must be stored externally.</li>\n<li>If using the plugin Dynmap or bluemap, map files should not exceed 25GB.\ntherefore, for this reason, we restrict Dynmap to a maximum resolution of 'lowres'.</li>\n<li>World files above 5GB must not include pre-generated chunks.\nChunks should be generated through gameplay.</li>\n<li>Exceeding any terms of our Fair Use Policy may result in the infringing files being removed.</li>\n<li>Any world pre-generation must not exceed a radius of 10K.\nThis is because world sizes grow exponentially as the radius grows.\nFor this reason, pre-generation plugins that do not have a configuration option to limit the maximum radius are blocked.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul> Server Management <ul>\n<li>The Server Management addon must be renewed

able to give friends access to your game panel, their own account can be created.</li>\n<li>Failure to report account breaches may result in suspension or termination of services.</li>\n<li>As we have rules preventing you from sharing your account, we assume that any use of your service to violate these rules was done by you, therefore it will be you and your service that will be penalised.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, don't use your service to exploit flaws in our software or hardware, or the software or hardware of other internet services.</li>\n</ul> Payment <ul>\n<li>Services are not activated until the first payment is received.</li>\n<li>If you don't renew your service before it expires, you have a one (1) day grace period in which you can pay the invoice for overdue

willing to grant 48 hours from the time of our request for you to login and request a refund.</li>\n<li> When logging in and opening your new request, you will need to reference the original ticket ID from the ticket you created while not logged in (this is only required if your initial 72 hour period has passed).</li>\n<li>Failure to provide the ticket ID will mean we are unable to locate your original request - we will not grant any additional time in this case.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The following services are not eligible for a refund: Minecraft Reseller</li>\n<li>If a Server Management request has been fulfilled for the client, we cannot issue a refund for this addon or any related service.</li>\n<li>If a Fast-Track ticket has received a reply, we cannot refund the payment for upgrading this ticket to Fast-Track.</li>\n<li>A payment made for the renewal of a service cannot be refunded.</li>\n<li>If the client opens a dispute, we reserve the right to suspend any and all of the client's services.</li>\n<li>All refunds will be provided as credit or via the original payment method at our discretion.</li>\n<li>If the client has opened any disputes on any transaction, refunds will only be provided at our discretion, and not in accordance with our refund policy.</li>\n<li>When a refund is issued, any related services will be terminated.</li> 72 Hour Refund Policy (Money Back Guarantee) <ul>\n<li>Subject to the conditions below, we can provide a refund within the first 72 hours of ordering a new service - all we ask is that you tell us why you wish to cancel your service and receive a refund.</li>\n<li>Each client is only eligible to claim our 72 Hour Refund Policy once.</li>\n<li>Refunds for services are available within the first 72 hours of a monthly plan commencing - please contact support to request a refund.\nBeyond this period, refunds are given solely at our discretion.</li>\n<li>All refund requests must be submitted via a cancellation request on our website.\nThe 72 hours is counted from the time of order to the time the cancellation is submitted.</li>\n<li>The client may be asked why they wish to receive a refund before a refund is issued, in which our team may offer assistance to resolve the issue the client is experiencing.\nIf there is no response from the client within 48 hours of any of our messages, eligibility to claim the 72 hour refund will be lost.</li>\n<li>The client must provide a reason for the refund request, however the reason provided will not affect eligibility.</li>\n<li>The client will be asked for confirmation on their refund request before a refund is issued.\nIf the client fails to make a confirmation within 48 hours of our request to do so, eligibility to claim the 72 hour refund will be lost.</li>\n<li>Our 72 hour refund policy only covers the first 72 hours after a new plan commences.\nPayments made for the renewal of services are not eligible for our 72 Hour Refund Policy.</li>\n<li>Opening a dispute on any of your payments will void eligibility for our 72 Hour Refund Policy.</li>\n<li>Our 72 hour money back guarantee only covers a single transaction per client account.</li>\n<li>If the client retracts the refund request or states that they do not confirm the refund, the request will become void.\nA new refund request can be submitted after this point, but will be treated as a new request and will only be eligible if 72 hours from the client's order has not passed.</li>\n<li>If a Server Management request is fulfilled, eligibility for the 72 hour refund immediately becomes void.</li>\n<li>Any client found to be creating multiple accounts in order to claim the 72 hour refund multiple times will be denied a refund.</li>\n<li>Some payment methods may not support refunds (as determined by the payment gateway).\nIn this case, the refund will be issued as account credit instead.</li>\n</ul> Overpayments &amp.\naccidental payments <ul>\n<li>We understand that overpayments and accidental payments sometimes occur and are willing to work with you to resolve the issue.</li>\n<li>A payment made by the user is not an \"accidental\" payment, and a refund of this type is subject to the conditions under the \"Refunds &amp.\nDisputes\" section of this page.</li>\n<li>An \"accidental\" payment is a payment that was made manually by the client that was not due.\nFor example, if the client had completed their payment multiple times.\nPayments of this type will be referred to as an \"overpayment\" from here on.</li>\n<li>An overpayment occurs when an invoice is paid multiple times - when this occurs, credit with the value of the overpayment is added to the client's account.</li>\n<li>Refunds can be offered for overpayments under the following conditions:<ul>\n<li>The refund request is made within a reasonable timeframe of the payment being sent.\nPayments via PayPal and other payment processors restrict the time frame a refund can be issued.\nFor this reason, we ask that your request is made within 7 days to give us plenty of time to issue the refund.\nIf the refund request if made beyond this point, we cannot guarantee we will be able to issue it.</li>\n<li>Our system automatically adds overpayments to your account credit - if any of this credit is used before a refund is issued, a refund cannot be issued.</li>\n<li>If there are multiple overpayments, only payments made within the past 30 days at the time the ticket is handled can be issued.\nThis is why we ask that you open a ticket with the request as soon as possible.</li>\n<li>The credit is unused and remains in the client's account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>When requesting a refund for an overpayment, please ensure you let us know the PayPal email used to make the overpayment, or the equivalent information for the payment method used to locate the payment, as well as the date the payment was completed.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul> Cancellations <ul>\n<li>If you do not wish to continue your service, you will need to submit a cancellation for the service from the Shockbyte client area.\nYou may contact our support if you require assistance with this.</li>\n<li>You may also wish to cancel any PayPal subscriptions you may have activated for your account.\nAs Shockbyte does not have access to the client's PayPal account we cannot and will not be responsible for incidental payments made from using the automatic payment subscription service.</li>\n</ul> Affiliates <ul>\n<li>Affiliate withdrawals can only be made to your Shockbyte credit balance or an external withdrawal via PayPal.</li>\n<li>Withdrawals via PayPal are subject to a 10% withdrawal fee.</li>\n<li>Withdrawals to your Shockbyte credit balance will receive a 10% bonus (for example: if you withdraw $100, you will be credited $110).</li>\n<li>Advertising your affiliate link on websites is permitted only if the website requires registration and displays that the author or user who posted the affiliate link is you.\nFor example, forums are permitted, but most coupon listing websites are not.</li>\n<li>Advertising your affiliate link on websites designed to provide coupon codes or discounts is not permitted.</li>\n<li>The full affiliate link provided should be visible when it is clicked.\nHiding it as another link or with a button or image is not permitted.</li>\n<li>Only the affiliate link provided should be advertised - using another link (such as a shortened URL) to redirect to your affiliate link is not permitted.</li>\n<li>The affiliate system is designed to refer new people to our service.\nCommissions will only apply to new customers.</li>\n<li>If we reasonbly believe a new account has been created to bypass the limitations in this terms of service, the commission will not apply.</li>\n<li>You cannot click your own affiliate link or receive commission for doing so.</li>\n<li>Affiliate commissions are granted for the value of the first month, irrespective of the billing cycle selected (e.g: If an annual billing cycle is selected, the commission value is only the portion from the first month - not the full year).</li>\n<li>Commissions from quarterly, semi-annual or annual billing cycles are not eligible for PayPal withdrawal.</li>\n<li>Any commissions earned will be held for a 35 day \"maturation period\".\nIf the referred service is refunded, cancelled or terminated during this time, the commission is void and will not be attributed to your affiliate account.</li>\n<li>An affiliate balance has no real-world value until it is withdrawn from your account.\nNon-compliance with any point in our terms of service will void your eligibility to withdraw your affiliate balance.</li>\n<li>At any time we may investigate your affiliate account to ensure all terms are followed.\nThis may involve asking questions before permitting a withdrawal.\nFailure to answer a question truthfully or at all may result in the removal of your affiliate balance and/or closure of your account.</li>\n<li>Any attempts to exploit the affiliate system may result the removal of your affiliate balance, nullification of your eligible to withdraw your affiliate balance and/or closure of your account.</li>\n<li>Violation of any of these terms may result the removal of your affiliate balance,

email or support ticket, however this is at our discretion.</li>\n<li>Generally, any violation of these terms may result in account suspension, termination or closure without refund.</li>\n<li>Any attempts to exploit any part of our system in any way may result in account suspension, termination or closure without refund.</li>\n</ul> Abuse <ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To report abuse on the Shockbyte network, contact us at https://shockbyte.com/contact</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Any abuse complaints regarding a service of yours will be forwarded to you and will require immediate attention.\nWe may
