allow you to log in to secure areas of our Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.\nWithout these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services.\nFunctionality Cookies These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have voted in and in some cases, to show you poll results, and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our

efficiently.\nIf you are an EU citizen we only use these cookies with your affirmative consent.\n<p>Your use of our Site indicates your consent to such use of Cookies, unless otherwise specified.\nCookies used for Analytics and Performance, Service Cookies, and Functionality cookies are considered strictly necessary, or Essential, and are collected from all users based on Our

opt-out, if successful, will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and internal Site operation purposes).</p>\n</li>\n<li> Your Cookie Choices And How To Opt-Out <p>You have the choice whether to accept the use of Cookies and we have explained how you can exercise your rights

on how to receive a notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.\nPlease see the links below for guidance on how to modify your web browser\u2019s settings on the most

device.</p>\n<p>Please note, however, that without HTTP cookies and HTML5 and Flash local storage, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features and parts of the Site will not function properly.</p>\n<p>Please note that rejecting Cookies does not mean that you will no longer see ads when you visit our Site.</p>\n<p>Throughout our Sites, we link out to other websites, such as publications, affiliates, advertisers, and partners.\nYou should review other website operators\u2019 privacy and cookie policies to determine the type and extent of tracking devices used by these

us and each Google entity identified in the Cookies and Tracking Technologies Used On Vox Media, Inc.\nSite section above.\nYou can revoke your consent at any time by following the procedures set forth in the Your Cookie Choices And How To Opt-Out section above and otherwise as provided herein.\nCertain information collected through cookies and other tracking technology does not require affirmative consent and you will not be able to opt out of collection.\nFor more information about online tracking and options to prevent most tracking visit the Future of Privacy Forum site.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Definitions Cookies <p>A cookie (sometimes referred to as local storage object or LSO) is a data file placed on a device.\nCookies can be created through a variety of web-related protocols and technologies, such as HTTP (sometimes referred to as \u201cbrowser cookies\u201d), HTML5, or Adobe Flash.\nFor more information on third-party cookies that we use for analytics, please review the table of cookies and tracking technologies within this Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy.</p> Web Beacons <p>Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \u201c1\u00d71 GIFs\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d) can be included in our online service\u2019s pages and messages.\nWeb beacons are invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon.</p>\n<p>Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.\nIn contrast to HTTP cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p> Deterministic Finger-printing Technologies <p>If a user can be positively identified across multiple devices, for instance, because the user has logged into a platform such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo or Twitter, it can be \u201cdetermined\u201d who the user is for purposes of improving customer service.</p> Probabilistic Finger-printing <p>Probabilistic tracking depends upon collecting non-personal data regarding device attributes like operating system, device make and model, IP addresses, ad requests and location data, and making statistical inferences to link multiple devices to a single user.\nNote that this is accomplished through proprietary algorithms owned by the companies performing probabilistic finger-printing.\nNote also that in the EU IP Addresses are personal information.</p> Device Graph <p>Device graphs can be created by combining non-personal data regarding use of smartphones and other devices with personal log-in information to track interactions with content across multiple devices.</p> Unique Identifier Header (UIDH) <p>\u201cUnique Identifier Header (UIDH) is the address information that accompanies Internet (http) requests transmitted over an ISP\u2019s wireless network.\nFor example, when a customer types on his or her phone the web address of a retailer that request travels over the network and is delivered to the retailer\u2019s website.\nThe information included in that request includes things like the device type and screen size so that the retailer site knows how to best display the site on the phone.\nThe UIDH is included in this information, and can be used as an anonymous way for advertisers to be able to determine that the user is part of a group that a third-party advertiser is attempting to reach.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the UIDH is a temporary, anonymous identifier included with unencrypted web traffic.\nWe change the UIDH on a regular basis to protect the privacy of our customers.\nWe do not use the UIDH to collect web browsing information and it does not broadcast individuals\u2019 web browsing activity out to advertisers or others.\u201d</p> Embedded Script <p>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the online service, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the online service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p> ETag, or Entity Tag <p>A feature of the cache in browsers, an ETag is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL.\nIf the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned.\nUsed in this manner ETags are a form of device identifier.\nETag tracking generates unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p> Unique Device Tokens <p>For each user that accepts push notifications in mobile apps, the app developer is provided with a unique device token (think of it as an address) from the app platform (e.g., Apple and Google).</p> Unique Device ID <p>The unique series of numbers and letters assigned to your device.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Contact Us <p>For any queries in relation to this Cookies and Tracking Technologies Policy or inquiries from outside of the U.S., please contact us at vmprivacy@voxmedia.com or here.\nPlease include as much detail as possible about your concern, question, or request.\nMessages that cannot be understood or do not present a clear request, may not be addressed.</p>\n<p>You can also contact us using the following information:</p>\n<p>Vox Media Inc., 1201
