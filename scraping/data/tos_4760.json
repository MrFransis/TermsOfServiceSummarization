/ </li>\n<li>Terms and Conditions</li>\n</ul> Terms and Conditions <p>\n<em>Version: 2012-08-01</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nScope of application</strong>\n<br>\nAll deliveries and customer services are subject to these General Terms and Conditions.\nAny terms and conditions deviating from these present terms and conditions are not valid without the express consent in writing of AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.\nThis also applies if AIRSENSE enters into a contractual relationship without reservation in the knowledge of the customer having contradictory or deviating terms and conditions.\nAll orders and commissions and any specific undertakings by AIRSENSE require order confirmation in writing by AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.\nThis may be waived only on the basis of written agreement.</p>\n<p>In the event of these terms and conditions coming into conflict with others, civil and commercial law will not apply but solely these General Terms and Conditions to the extent that no mandatory statutory regulations provide otherwise.<br>\nThese General Terms and Conditions apply only with respect to entrepreneurs, legal entities under public law or special assets under public law as defined in \u00a7 310 I BGB (German Civil Code).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nSubject of the contract</strong>\n<br>\nMinor deviations from the description of the offer are regarded as approved and do not affect compliance with the contract.\nModifications and/or improvements that serve the purpose of technical progress or enhance the value of goods may be undertaken at any time without a change to the subject of the contract being required, insofar as this is reasonable for the customer.\nSome products may contain selected and carefully reconditioned parts, the performance of which corresponds to that of new parts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nOffers to enter into a contract / acceptance</strong>\n<br>\nAll offers made by AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH are subject to change and without obligation.\nThey are not offers to contract but requests for the submission of offers to contract by the customer.\nThe right to sell the goods elsewhere is reserved.\nOrders, commissions and any specific undertakings by AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH require written confirmation by AIRSENSE in order to be effective.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nDelivery and scope of contractual obligations</strong>\n<br>\nIf it is agreed that specific products will be installed and made ready for use on the customer\u2019s premises, the products will be regarded as ready for use if no errors are detected during a functional test using test programmes and procedures developed by AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH for this purpose, and once AIRSENSE has confirmed to the customer in writing that the products are ready for use.\nOtherwise, AIRSENSE will carry out the functional test during the final inspection in the factory.\nThe customer must allow AIRSENSE free access to the products supplied by AIRSENSE at the agreed customer service appointments and unrestricted access to the associated diagnostics and operating programs, documentation, etc.</p>\n<p>Within the framework of customer service commissions, AIRSENSE is authorised to perform all necessary maintenance work and all other work that may be necessary for ensuring fault-free functioning of the instruments and their specifications.\nFunctional improvements may be undertaken by AIRSENSE at any time and will not be invoiced to the customer.<br>\nAIRSENSE Analytics GmbH is authorised to provide partial deliveries and partial services to an extent that can be deemed reasonable for the customer, if the partial delivery or partial service takes place before the due date of the delivery commitment and if partial deliveries or partial services are indicated as such.\nPartial delivery or partial service cannot be provided insofar as the customer may demand delivery from one series in order to avoid material defects.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nDelivery dates and deadlines</strong>\n<br>\nDelivery dates depend on availability of the products at the time of receipt of the order by AIRSENSE.\nAll dates and deadlines for deliveries and services from AIRSENSE are binding only if they have been defined as binding in writing by AIRSENSE.<br>\nCompliance with all the customer\u2019s contractual obligations is a prerequisite for the delivery deadline being met by AIRSENSE.\nIf the customer is a merchant as defined by the German Commercial Code (HGB), the delivery deadline is regarded as having been met if the goods to be delivered have left the warehouse by the time of the deadline or if the customer has been informed that they are ready for shipment.</p>\n<p>If the customer is in default of acceptance or has otherwise infringed its obligations of cooperation, AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH is entitled to claim compensation, including additional costs.\nThe right to make further claims is reserved.</p>\n<p>Liability for accidental loss or deterioration to the goods passes to the customer with effect from the time of infringement of contractual obligations by the customer (obligation of cooperation, other obligation).</p>\n<p>If failure to meet a deadline is attributable to reasons for which AIRSENSE cannot be held responsible, e.g.\nforce majeure, lock-out, interruption of the supply of raw materials, or other unpredictable, exceptional circumstances outside the control of AIRSENSE, the delivery deadline will be extended by an appropriate time.\nIf AIRSENSE is unable to deliver a product by the agreed delivery deadline for other reasons, the customer must set AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH an appropriate grace period for delivery.\nThe customer is entitled to withdraw from the contract after fruitless expiry of a reasonable deadline set by the customer in the event of unreasonable extension of the delivery deadline, but no sooner than four weeks after the occurrence of a reason based on force majeure for extension of the delivery deadline.</p>\n<p>Total withdrawal from the whole contract after the start of implementation of the contract is possible only if the customer demonstrably has no further interest in the partial deliveries already provided.\nLiability of the user is ruled out in such cases.<br>\nThe customer otherwise remains obliged to accept and pay for later delivery insofar as this does not substantially impair its interests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nReservation of delivery</strong>\n<br>\nAIRSENSE is entitled to withdraw from the contract in the event of non-delivery by an upstream supplier to AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH, for which AIRSENSE is not responsible.<br>\nIf performance or delivery becomes impossible or unreasonable for reasons beyond the control of AIRSENSE, AIRSENSE will be released from its performance obligation.<br>\nAIRSENSE is not liable for default or non-compliance if circumstances apply that AIRSENSE is unable to influence with reasonable effort and expense.\nThe customer will be informed of this without delay and any payments already made will be refunded.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nOrder cancellation and indemnification</strong>\n<br>\nIf the customer cancels an order with the consent of AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH, AIRSENSE may, without further evidence, demand indemnification in the sum of 15% of the basic price in accordance with the AIRSENSE list price for the product in question.\nIn the event of cancellation after delivery of the products, the customer will be additionally charged with the cost of return transport, plus a lump sum for loss of value and use of 25% of the purchase price in the case of return and cancellation within the first six months after delivery, with a further 10% for each additional six months up to the end of 2 years, and subsequently a further 5% for each additional year.\nThis will not apply if the customer can prove that AIRSENSE has suffered no loss or has suffered a substantially lower loss.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nAssignment, offset and right of retention</strong>\n<br>\nThe customer may transfer rights and obligations arising from this contract only with the written consent of AIRSENSE.\nHe may offset against payment claims by AIRSENSE only if the counterclaim for payment on the part of the customer is undisputed or legally binding.\nRight of retention may only be invoked for claims arising from the same legal relationship with AIRSENSE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nPrices and packaging costs</strong>\n<br>\nOnly the current list prices of AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH at the time of receipt of the order plus the statutory value-added tax are applicable.\nPrices are binding from receipt of the order up to the end of a delivery window of four months.\nChanges to an order that extend the delivery date beyond these four months will be treated like a new order based on the currently applicable AIRSENSE list prices.\nPrices are carriage forward ex works excluding supplementary payments.\nThe costs of packaging and shipment will be paid by the customer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nPayment and due dates</strong>\n<br>\nPayments are due immediately upon receipt of invoice.\nThis also applies to invoices for partial deliveries.\nBills of exchange are acceptable as means of payment only if this has been agreed in advance.\nBills of exchange and cheques are accepted only as conditional payment.\nStamp duty on bills of exchange and collecting expenses must be borne by the customer.\nAIRSENSE Analytics GmbH is entitled to calculate interest in the sum of 8 percentage points above the base interest rate from the due date for late payment if the customer is a merchant.\nAIRSENSE Analytics GmbH reserves the right to claim further damages resulting from default.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nAdvance payment and security</strong>\n<br>\nIf the customer\u2019s financial circumstances should deteriorate, or should any justifiable doubts arise as to its ability or willingness to pay, particularly in the event of bill of exchange or cheque protests, applications for insolvency proceedings to be opened, or payment arrears from other performances, AIRSENSE is entitled to demand payment in advance or security and to withhold performances until advance payment or security has been received, or to withdraw entirely or in part from the contract.\nIn any event, all claims by AIRSENSE arising from the contractual relationship are payable immediately.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nInsurance of the goods</strong>\n<br>\nAIRSENSE Analytics GmbH is entitled but not obliged to insure the goods at the expense of the customer.\nAIRSENSE Analytics GmbH will inform the customer as to whether the goods have been insured.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nDefault of acceptance</strong>\n<br>\nIn the event of delivery or the performance of services being delayed by circumstances that are the responsibility of the customer, he is liable to pay the costs incurred by AIRSENSE from this delay.\nFor each week of delay, AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH may demand flat-rate compensation in the sum of 3% of the value of the delivery but no more than a maximum of 15% of the delivery value, although AIRSENSE remains free to prove higher damages.\nThe customer is free to prove that AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH has incurred no damages or substantially lower damages as a result of the default of acceptance.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nTransfer of risk</strong>\n<br>\nThe risk is transferred to the customer as soon as the shipment is handed over to the person implementing the transport, or has left AIRSENSE\u2019s business site for dispatch, regardless of whether shipment takes place from the place of performance and of who bears the carriage costs.\nIf the goods are in the warehouse and shipment or acceptance is delayed for reasons beyond the control of AIRSENSE, the risk is transferred to the customer upon receipt of notification that the goods are ready for shipment.\nThis does not apply to obligations to be performed at the creditor\u2019s place of business and to mail order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nComplaints</strong>\n<br>\nWarranty claims by the customer as a result of obvious defects are not permissible unless the customer makes the complaint immediately upon handover of the product.\nIf the customer is a merchant, the obligations regarding inspection and complaint under \u00a7 377 HGB must be observed and complaints made immediately.\nThe statutory term applies to concealed defects.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nLimitation of liability</strong>\n<br>\nClaims for compensation resulting from other defects are not permitted unless they are based on wilful or grossly negligent violation of obligation by AIRSENSE, its legal representatives or agents.\nCases in which liability is mandatory under the German Product Liability Act or as a result of physical injury and cases involving claims arising from \u00a7\u00a7 280, 281, 283, 311a para.\n2 BGB constitute exceptions to the above.\nAny further claims against AIRSENSE, legal representatives and agents of AIRSENSE are excluded.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nSoftware licences</strong>\n<br>\nThe customer is granted non-exclusive, restricted utilisation rights to AIRSENSE software and to third-party software supplied by AIRSENSE (software developed by a software supplier independent of AIRSENSE) and to the relevant associated documentation, supplements thereto and other documents, for the purpose of personal use or in the context of the customer\u2019s business operations on its computer system.\nAll other rights to the software and documentation, including copies and subsequent upgrades are retained by AIRSENSE and the software supplier.\nSub-licences may not be issued.\nThe customer may observe, investigate or test the functioning of the software in order to determine the ideas and principles underlying the software if this is accomplished by means of actions involving loading, display, running, transfer and saving of the software to which the customer is entitled under the contract.\nApart from this, the customer may not, without the written consent of AIRSENSE, duplicate, process, translate or convert the software from object code to source code, either wholly or in part.\nThe customer must ensure that the software and documentation is not accessible to third parties without the written consent of AIRSENSE in advance.\nCopies may in principle be created only for archiving purposes, for data protection and for debugging.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\nWarranty</strong>\n<br>\nIn the case of software, the restricted licence and warranty provisions of the relevant manufacturer apply as additionally recognised.<br>\nAIRSENSE points out that it is not technically possible to develop error-free software for all conditions of use.\nA minor reduction of usefulness is therefore not taken into account.\nThe possibility cannot be ruled out that data may be deleted or become unusable during software installation, so that third-party programs may possibly no longer function perfectly.\nAIRSENSE assumes no liability for this.\nLosses and consequential losses linked to the above are borne by the customer.\nThe customer undertakes to create complete back-up copies of its data prior to any installation work and to install these in the event of any data loss in order to prevent the occurrence of loss or to reduce the extent of such loss.\nInsofar as the customer demands a specific hard- and software arrangement, AIRSENSE assumes no liability for the perfect functioning of the software on the hardware specified by the customer.\nSoftware errors that have more than a minor adverse effect on the intended use will be corrected, at AIRSENSE\u2019s discretion and depending on the importance of the error, by the supply of an improved version of the software or, in the case of minor errors, by eliminating or bypassing the effects of the error.</p>\n<p>AIRSENSE is entitled to eliminate faults in performance and to repair or replace defective products as it sees fit.\nParts that are replaced become the property of AIRSENSE without compensation.\nThe customer is entitled to withdraw from the contract or to demand a reduction in the purchase price or payment in the event of failure of the corrective actions.\nThe customer must allow AIRSENSE reasonable time and opportunity to correct any faults.\nAIRSENSE is released from warranty should the customer refuse to do this.\nIncorrectly performed modifications, repairs, maintenance and operation of the products by the customer or third parties exclude AIRSENSE\u2019s liability for any consequences of such actions.\nLiability for defects is ruled out in the case of natural wear or soiling.\nThis applies in particular to any gas sensors used.</p>\n<p>The warranty period is 12 months.\nfor repairs and spare part deliveries and for customer services taking place after expiry of the original warranty period, the warranty period is 6 months or 12 months in the case of the purchase of consumer goods.\nThe warranty period commences with the transfer of risk to the customer or with receipt by the customer of the notice that the goods are ready for shipment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.\nRetention of title, assignment of security</strong>\n<br>\nAIRSENSE Analytics GmbH retains ownership of the products supplied until the purchase price has been paid in full and until all obligations arising from the contractual relationship have been fulfilled (goods subject to retention of title).\nIf the customer is a merchant, the property passes to him only once all its obligations arising from the business relationship with AIRSENSE have been redeemed, including future (balance) claims.\nIn the event of installation in third-party goods or conversion by the customer, AIRSENSE will be co-owner of the newly created products in proportion to the value of the goods subject to retention of title as a percentage of the third-party goods with which they are being used.\nThe products created in this way are also regarded as goods subject to retention of title by AIRSENSE.\nIf the customer does not meet its payment obligations to AIRSENSE, he is entitled to resell the goods subject to retention of title only if he discloses the retained title.\nNo other disposal of the goods subject to retention of title is permitted, particularly not pledging or assignment of security.\nIn the event of access by third parties to the goods subject to retention of title, the customer must point out AIRSENSE\u2019s ownership and inform AIRSENSE without delay.\nBy way of security, the customer hereby assigns any future receivables from the resale or subleasing of the goods subject to retention of title, including all ancillary rights, in the sum of the value of these goods.\nThe customer is entitled and obliged to collect the assigned receivables.\nIn the event of the customer defaulting on payment, AIRSENSE is entitled to revoke this collection authorisation at any time and to notify the sub-purchasers of the assignment, to take back the goods subject to retention of title or, if appropriate, to demand the assignment of the customer\u2019s right to recover possession from third parties.\nThe customer is obliged to provide AIRSENSE with the information required to collect the receivables and to hand over any associated documents.\nTaking back or pledging the goods subject to retention of title by AIRSENSE does not constitute withdrawal from the contract.\nAIRSENSE will release the securities at the request of the customer insofar as their value exceeds all the claims being secured by more than 20%.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.\nWritten form and partial invalidity</strong>\n<br>\nThe invalidity of individual provisions of these General Terms and Conditions or of individual contracts does not affect the validity of the remaining agreements and provisions.\nAll amendments to the contract must be in writing in order to be effective.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.\nData protection</strong>\n<br>\nThe customer agrees that its data may be stored and processed electronically within AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>22.\nPlace of performance and jurisdiction, applicable law</strong>\n<br>\nThe place of performance for all deliveries and performances is Schwerin.\nSchwerin is agreed as the place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from the business relationship insofar as the customer is a merchant as defined in the German Commercial Code (HGB) or has no general place of jurisdiction in the Federal Republic of Germany.\nAIRSENSE is entitled to assert claims before the competent court of the domicile/registered office or habitual residence of the customer.\nThe law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies exclusively, to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>AIR</strong>SENSE Analytics GmbH<br>\nHagenower Stra\u00dfe 73<br>\n19061 Schwerin / Germany<br>\nT +49 385

protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.\nThe use of the Internet pages of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH is possible without any indication of personal data.\nhowever, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>\n<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.\nBy means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.\nFurthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>\n<p>As the controller, the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.\nHowever, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.\nFor this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g.\nby telephone.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nDefinitions</strong>\n<br>\nThe data protection declaration of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of

marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>e) Profiling</em>\n<br>\nProfiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>f) Pseudonymisation</em>\n<br>\nPseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is

Controller or controller responsible for the processing</em>\n<br>\nController or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\nwhere the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law,

rules according to the purposes of the processing.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>j) Third party</em>\n<br>\nThird party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>k) Consent</em>\n<br>\nConsent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nName and Address of the controller</strong>\n<br>\nController for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation

deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nCollection of general data and information</strong>\n<br>\nThe website of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.\nThis general data and information are stored in the server log files.\nCollected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>\n<p>When using these general data and information, the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nContact possibility via the website </strong>\n<br>\nThe website of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address).\nIf a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored.\nSuch personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.\nThere is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data</strong>\n<br>\nThe data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.<br>\nIf the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nRights of the data subject</strong>\n<br>\n<em>a) Right of confirmation</em>\n<br>\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of

and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.<br>\nFurthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.\nWhere this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.<br>\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.<br>\n<em>c) Right to rectification </em>\n<br>\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her.\nTaking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data

controller.<br>\n<em>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) </em>\n<br>\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:<br>\nThe personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.<br>\nThe data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.<br>\nThe data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the

controller.\nAn employee of AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.<br>\nWhere the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures,

contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.<br>\nThe processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.<br>\nThe controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.<br>\nThe data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.<br>\nIf one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller.\nThe employee of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH will arrange the restriction of the processing.<br>\n<em>f) Right to data portability</em>\n<br>\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nHe or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller

contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.<br>\nFurthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.<br>\nIn order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.<br>\n<em>g) Right to object</em>\n<br>\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.\nThis also applies to profiling based on these provisions.<br>\nThe AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.<br>\nIf the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.\nThis applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\nIf the data

of public interest.<br>\nIn order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH.\nIn addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/<dfn>EC</dfn>, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.<br>\n<em>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</em>\n<br>\nEach data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.<br>\nIf the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the AIRSENSE Analytics GmbH shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.<br>\nIf the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the

Analytics GmbH.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nData protection for applications and the application procedures</strong>\n<br>\nThe data controller shall collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the application procedure.\nThe processing may also be carried out electronically.\nThis is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website to the controller.\nIf the data controller concludes an employment contract with an applicant, the submitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements.\nIf no employment contract is concluded with the applicant by the controller, the application documents shall be automatically erased two months after notification of the refusal decision, provided that no other legitimate interests of the controller are opposed to the erasure.\nOther legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g.\na burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nLegal basis for the processing </strong>\n<br>\nArt.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIs our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\nSuch processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nHe considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nThe legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</strong>\n<br>\nWhere the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored</strong>\n<br>\nThe criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.\nAfter expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.\nRequirement necessary to enter into a contract.\nObligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data </strong>\n<br>\nWe clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nExistence of automated decision-making</strong>\n<br>\nAs a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>\n<p>This Privacy
