bandwidth quota.\nAccounts with multiple services will gain the benefit of each service's quota combined (they are cumulative).\nUsage during the month that is trending above the total quota (i.e.\nis projected to exceed the quota by the end of the month based upon the current portion of the month already passed) will generate a warning email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional bandwidth transfer usage beyond the quota will be billed at $4.95 per gigabyte in 1GB increments.</strong> The bandwidth quota includes bandwidth used for content you host here at Sonic.net, including web, FTP and multimedia.\nIt does not apply to content you download to your PC via your dialup, DSL, or other Sonic.net connection.</p>\n<p>This hosted website and media bandwidth quota is applied across all of your sites as a group, so you receive significant benefit if you have multiple sites hosted on your Sonic.net account.\nIt is not required that bandwidth be used equally by your sites.\nthis means that if you have one site that's more popular or larger, it receives the benefit of the leftover quota for the smaller or less popular sites.</p>\n<p>To view your current bandwidth and disk quota usage please see Disk Usage Monitoring in the Member Tools.\nWe also support some forms of bandwidth quota protection for hosting usage.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n2.\nDisk usage at Sonic.net\n<p>Each Sonic.net service on an account which comes with a disk quota will increase the amount of disk storage available on our servers by a set amount.\nUsage during the month that is trending above the quota (that is, is projected to exceed the quota by the end of the month based upon the current portion of the month which has passed) will generate a warning email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional disk usage beyond the quota will be billed at $10 per 250 megabytes.</strong> The disk quota includes disk space used for content you host here at Sonic.net, including web, FTP, unix home directory, streaming multimedia servers, MySQL and SSL.</p>\n<p>Disk quotas are cumulative and applied across all of your services as a group, so you receive significant benefit if you have multiple sites or services hosted on your Sonic.net account.\nIt is not required that disk space be used equally by your sites.\nthis means that if you have one site that's more popular or larger, it receives the benefit of the leftover quota for the smaller or less popular sites.</p>\n<p>To view your current bandwidth and historical disk quota usage please see Bandwidth Monitoring and Historical Disk Usage in the Member Tools.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For information regarding email disk usage see this article</p>\n3.\nDefinitions\n<p>For the purposes of disk and bandwidth usage, Sonic.net uses the IEEE compliant definition of \"megabyte\" and \"gigabyte.\" One megabyte consists of 1,000,000 (one million) bytes, one gigabyte consists of 1,000,000,000 (one US billion) bytes.\nInformation on the IEEE standard can be found at
