within the court\u2019s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis).\nClaims are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies.\nArbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist, or may arise in the future.</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt out of this agreement to arbitrate if you tell us within 60 days of your first download or use of SLOWLY that you want to opt out.\nIf you want to opt out, send a written notice advising us of your

arbitration against or on behalf of anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.\nIf these terms relating to class or representative procedures are legally unenforceable for any reason, then this agreement to arbitrate will be inapplicable to that claim, and that claim will instead be handled through litigation in court rather than by arbitration.\nNo arbitrator shall have authority to entertain any claim on behalf of a person who is not a named party, nor shall any arbitrator have authority to make any award for the benefit of, or against, any person who is not a named party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nPermitted Time For Filing A Claim or Lawsuit</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of SLOWLY or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nClaims Of Copyright Or Other Intellectual Property Infringement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask our users to do the same.\nWe may, in our sole discretion, disable or terminate the accounts of users whom we believe may be infringing the intellectual property rights of others.</p>\n<p>If you believe your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide us with

agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner\u2019s behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please provide claims of copyright or other intellectual property infringement to us at support@getslowly.com.\nWe will consider the information you provide and other information we may obtain, and we may remove Content that we determine may infringe on your rights in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\nMiscellaneous</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may not use SLOWLY where prohibited by law, and you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable content.\nOur failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid by an arbitrator or pursuant to the disputes section above or a court of competent jurisdiction, you nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to our intentions as reflected in these TOS.\nThe other provisions of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.\nLanguage</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These TOS were written in English.\nIf you are
