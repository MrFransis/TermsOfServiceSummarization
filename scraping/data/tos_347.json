control</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>Other than for those that are considered \u201cessential\u201d (more on that below), if you do not wish to accept these technologies in connection with your visit to or use of our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, you may visit our Manage Settings page, and may also exercise any of the additional options that are described below.\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>What are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>These technologies are essentially small data files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone or other device (\u201ccollectively, a \u201cdevice\u201d) that allows us to record information when you visit or interact with our websites, service, applications, messaging, and other tools.\nThough often these technologies are generically referred to as \u201cCookies,\u201d each functions slightly differently, and is better explained below:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small (often encrypted) text files placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message.\nCookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser.\nThere are several types of cookies: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Session cookies</em> expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Persistent cookies</em> are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>First-party cookies</em> are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time in order to preserve your settings (e.g., while on our site).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Third-party cookies</em> are placed in your browser by a website, or domain, that is not the website or domain that you are currently visiting.\nIf a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cookies are used for a variety of purposes on our website.\nAs an example, we use cookies to store information that allows us to present our site in your local language, or prices in local currency.\nWe also use cookies to communicate data to our servers when you visit, allowing you to stay logged in to your account during your visit or maintain the site preferences you select.\nPreventing your browser from accepting 1st party cookies will prevent the placement of some cookies that are classified as \u201cEssential\u201d.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web beacons:</strong> A web beacon (also called \u201ctracking pixels\u201d or \u201cimage tags\u201d) is a small file (most often a transparent, 1x1 GIF file) that is loaded on our web pages.\nThese pixels may work in concert with cookies to collect information about your visit, your web browser/device, browsing activity, or onsite behavior and provide that information to service providers.\nPixels are most commonly used to collect anonymous traffic metrics (page visits, button clicks, order completion) used to analyze site performance.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scripts</strong>: A script is a small piece of website code placed on our websites to power customer service tools like live chat, allow for the delivery of video tutorials in our help section, and allow us to provide interactive experiences to visitors.\nThey are also used to collect data that we use for website analytics, or to provide data on the effectiveness of our advertising.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Similar technologies:</strong> Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage, such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application software methods.\nThese technologies can operate across all of your browsers.\nIn some instances, these technologies may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device.\nWe do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>What technologies do we use and why</strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n<p>Our cookies, web beacons and similar technologies serve various purposes, but generally they (1) are necessary or essential to the functioning of our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, (2) help us improve the performance of or provide you extra functionality of the same, (3) help us to serve relevant and targeted advertisements, or (4) allow us to offer support tools that you utilize to interact with our care guides:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary or Essential</strong>: \"Strictly necessary\" or \u201cessential\u201d cookies, web beacons and similar technologies let you move around the website and use essential features like secure areas and shopping baskets.\nWithout these technologies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.\nPlease note that these technologies do not gather any information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.\nAccepting these technologies is a condition of using our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, so if you utilize tools that might prevent these from loading, we can't guarantee your use or how the security therein will perform during your visit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance:</strong> Performance technologies may include first or third-party cookies, web beacons/pixels, and scripts placed in order to gather information about how you use our website (pages you visit, if you experience any errors, load times).\nThese cookies do not collect any information that could identify you and are only used to help us improve how our website works, understand the interests of our users, and measure how effective our content is by providing anonymous statistics and data regarding how our website is used.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising:</strong> Advertising technology may include first or third-party cookies, web beacons/pixels, and scripts placed in order to gather information on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, deliver personalized content, or to generate data that allows for the delivery of advertising relevant to your specific interests on our sites, as well as third-party websites.\nWe also utilize 3rd party service providers to assist us in delivering on the same functions, which means that our authorized service providers may also place cookies, web beacons and similar technologies on your device via our services (first and third party cookies).\nThey may also collect information that helps them identify your device, such as IP address, or other unique or device identifiers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Support</strong>: Support technologies may include first or third-party cookies, web beacons / pixels, and scripts placed in order to provide tools for you to interact with our customer support teams.\nThis technology allows us to provide chat services, gather customer feedback, and other tools used to support our visitors.\nData collected for these purposes is never used for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>How to manage, control and delete these technologies</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>You may manage certain cookies, web beacons and similar technologies we place by visiting our Manage Settings control panel.\nYou may also visit our \"Advertising Preferences\" link in the footer of our webpages.</p>\n<p>You may block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.\nHowever, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.\nUnless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit our site.\n<em>Please note, as further described in our Privacy Policy, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal from a

DBP.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>b.\nEmail Forwarding</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Whois directory requires an email address for every purchased domain name registration.\nWhen You purchase a private domain registration, DBP creates a private email address for that domain name, \"@domainsbyproxy.com\".\nThereafter, when messages are sent to that private email address, DBP handles them according to the email preference You selected for that particular domain name.\nYou have three (3) email preferences from which to choose.\nYou can elect to:<br>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Have all of the messages forwarded;</li>\n<li> Have all of the messages filtered for Spam and then forwarded.\nor</li>\n<li>Have none of the messages forwarded.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<br>\nAs with all communications, You agree to waive any and all claims arising from Your failure to receive email directed to Your domain name but not forwarded to You by DBP.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nNotifications Regarding Correspondence and Your Obligation to Respond</strong>\n<br>\nWhen DBP receives certified or traceable courier mail or legal notices addressed to Your domain name, in most cases, DBP will attempt to forward the mail to you via email.\nIf You do not respond to the DBP email and/or the correspondence DBP has received regarding Your domain name registration concerns a dispute of any kind or otherwise requires immediate disposition, DBP may immediately reveal Your identity and/or cancel the DBP private registration service regarding either the domain name registration(s) in question.\nThis means the Whois directory will revert to displaying Your name, postal address, email address and phone number that you provided to DBP.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>d.\nAdditional Administrative Fees</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nDBP reserves the right to charge You reasonable \"administrative fees\" or \"processing fees\" for (i) tasks DBP may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs DBP may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) Your non-compliance with the Agreement (as determined by DBP in its sole and absolute discretion).\nTypical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to, (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time and attention.\n(ii) disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by DBP staff or by outside firms retained by DBP.\n(iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by DBP as the result of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by You, Your bank or Payment Method processor.\nThese administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method You have on file with Your Registrar.</p>\n<p>You agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding that takes place relating to or arising out of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>6 .\nLIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL DBP BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER

WEBSITE OR YOUR PROVISION OF ANY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO DBP OR ANY THIRD PARTY.\nTHIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF DBP HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR SUCH DAMAGES WERE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.\nBECAUSE CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE LIMITATION OR ELIMINATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, DBP'S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SMALLEST AMOUNT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br>\n<br>\nYOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT DBP DISCLAIMS ANY LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>THE INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE OR THEFT OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION;</li>\n<li>ACCESS DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR WEBSITE OR THE WEBSITES OF OUR AFFILIATED REGISTRARS;</li>\n<li>DATA NON-DELIVERY OF MIS-DELIVERY BETWEEN YOU AND DBP;</li>\n<li>THE

unenforceable or invalid, in whole or in part, such provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it legal, enforceable and valid, and the legality, enforceability and validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected or impaired.\nThe headings herein will not be considered a part of this Agreement.\nYou agree this Agreement, including the policies

domain name registration disputes, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the District of Arizona located in Phoenix, Arizona.\nYou agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any proceeding, regardless of venue, that takes place relating to or arising out of this Agreement.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>c.\nNotices</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nAll notices from DBP to You will be sent to the email address You provided to DBP.\nNotices by email shall be deemed effective twenty-four (24) hours after the email is sent by DBP, unless DBP receives notice that the

claim.\nIn the event You have reason to believe that circumstances exist which warrant the filing of an insurance claim, please send a written notice (specifying the basis for such claim), via certified mail, return receipt requested, to:<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nDomains By Proxy, LLC<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAttn: Insurance Claims<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n14455

lose Your domain name registration to a third party solely as a result of DBP's willful misconduct, Your Registrar (the \"Indemnifying Party\") will indemnify and hold You harmless against any losses, damages or costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any claim, action, proceeding, suit or demand arising out of or related to the loss of Your domain name registration.\nSuch indemnification obligations under this Section 10(e) are conditioned upon the following:<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That You promptly give both DBP and the Indemnifying Party written notice of the claim, demand, or action and provide reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party, at its cost and expense, in connection therewith, and</li>\n<li>That the Indemnifying Party has the right, at its option, to control and direct the defense to any settlement of such claim, demand, or action.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\nAny notice concerning indemnification shall, with respect to DBP, be sent in accordance with Section 10(c) of this Agreement.\nWith respect to Your Registrar, notices regarding indemnification should be sent in accordance with the notification provisions contained in Your Registrar's Domain Name Registration Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>f.\nTerm of Agreement.\nSurvival</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe terms of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long

products, services, websites and mobile applications, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (collectively, our \u201cServices\u201d).\nYour personal information includes information such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Date of birth</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Billing and payment information</li>\n<li>Candidate information (for job applicants)</li>\n<li>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy not only explains how and why we use your personal information that we collect, but also how you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information.\nWe\u2019ve also created a Trust Center that offers answers to your most common questions, quick links to access your Account Settings, instructions on how to exercise certain rights that might be available to you, and definitions to key terms and concepts noted in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (\u201cDPO\u201d) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at privacy@godaddy.com.\nThis inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>What information we collect, how we collect it, and why</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);</li>\n<li>request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number);</li>\n<li>complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email).\nor</li>\n<li>participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.\nThese methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we\u2019d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services.\nThese technologies automatically collect data when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs, page load time, server response time, and approximate location information to measure website performance and improve our systems, including optimizing DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations.\nSpecifically, interactions with the features, content and links (including those of third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data is collected.\nAll this allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyze and improve the performance of our Services.\nWe may also collect your location (IP address) so that we can personalize our Services.\nFor additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize, please visit our Cookie Policy.\nIf you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising click here [or if located in the European Union click here].\nPlease note you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Supplemented Data</strong> may be received about you from other sources,

you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>How we utilize information.</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services.</strong> We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services.\nWe utilize this information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)</li>\n<li>Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services</li>\n<li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems</li>\n<li>Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services</li>\n<li>Understand and analyze how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to

TERMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you order the Services.\nGoDaddy expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you.\nIf you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.\n</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specifically noted (for reasons such as those highlighted in Section 2(x) above), the renewal price for any domain name in any TLD will be the same as the list (non-sale) price shown when you search for and select a domain, and again in the cart prior to purchase.\nFor example, if the list price is $9.99, and a different renewal price is not specifically identified, then the renewal price is also $9.99.\nLikewise, if a domain name has a sale price of $8.99, with the list (non-sale) price shown (as a strike-through) at $9.99, the renewal price will be $9.99*.\n</p>\n<p>\n<small>* Renewal price subject to change prior to actual date of renewal.</small>\n</p>\n<p>For all other terms and conditions relating to fees, payment, refund and billing, etc.\napplicable to the Services offered under the scope of this Agreement, please refer to the \u201cFees and Payments\u201d section of our Universal Terms of Service.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(B) DOMAIN NAME RENEWAL TERMS_</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you register a domain name, you will have the following renewal options: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> Automatic Renewal is the default setting.\nDomain names will automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your original domain name registration, and payment will be taken from the Payment Method you have on file with GoDaddy, at GoDaddy's then current rates.\nThus, if you have chosen to register your domain name for one (1) year, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for one (1) year.\nIf you have chosen to register your domain name for two (2) years, GoDaddy will automatically renew it for two (2) years, and so on.\nIf you wish to change your automatic renewal term to a different period from your original term, as of 16 July 2020, you may manually renew the domain registration to establish a new default automatic renewal term for the domain.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Manual Renewal.</strong> If you have elected to turn off automatic renewal and cancel the product (i.e., cancel the domain name registration) effective at expiration of the then current term, you may nonetheless elect to manually renew the domain name at anytime prior to its expiration date by logging into your Account Manager and manually implementing the renewal or by calling customer service (should you in fact want the domain name to be renewed).\nIf you fail to manually implement the renewal before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All renewals will be subject to the terms of this Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time, and you acknowledge and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (as amended) for all renewed domains.\nDomain name renewals will be non-refundable.\nIn the event that we are unable to automatically renew your domain name for the renewal option selected for any reason, we may automatically renew your domain name for a period less than your original registration period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.\nIf for any reason GoDaddy is not able to take the payment from the Payment Method you have on file, and you fail to respond to our notices, your domain name registration will expire.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your Payment Method information current, which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card.\n</p>\n<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .br, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal billing will occur on the first day of the month prior to the month of expiration.</p>\n<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .ca, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg), renewal will occur, or must occur manually if the product was previously cancelled, no later than the 20th of the month prior to the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.\nFor some ccTLDs (.es) renewal must be processed no later than seven days before the expiration date, or your domain name will be placed in non-renewal status.\nWhen the domain name is in non-renewal status, you can renew the domain name only by calling GoDaddy and requesting that the domain name be renewed.\nYou cannot renew the domain name through your Account Manager.\nIf you fail to manually implement the renewal of any cancelled product before the expiration date, the domain name will be cancelled and you will no longer have use of that name.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that GoDaddy will not be responsible for cancelled domain names that you fail to renew in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement.\nIn any case, if you fail to renew your domain name in a timely fashion, additional charges may apply.\nIf you signed up for privacy services, protected registration, or any other similar service, with your domain name registration, these services will automatically be renewed when your domain name registration is up for renewal, and you will incur the applicable additional renewal fee unless you cancel in advance.\n</p>\n<p>If you fail to renew your domain name in the timeframes indicated in this Agreement, you agree that GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your behalf.\nIf GoDaddy decides to renew your expired domain name on your behalf, you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you must reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal and keep your domain name.\nThe Renewal Grace Period is currently twelve (12) days but subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>For certain ccTLDs (.am, .at, .be, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .org.cn, .de, .eu, .fm, .fr, .gs, .it, .jp, .ms, .nu, .nz, .co.nz, .net.nz, .org.nz, .tc, .tk, .tw, .com.tw, .org.tw, .idv.tw, .uk, and .vg) there is no Renewal Grace Period after the expiration date of the domain name.\nIf you do not reimburse GoDaddy for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which you may have up to a 30-day redemption period to redeem your domain name, provided that your domain name is not subject to an expired domain name auction bid and you pay GoDaddy a Redemption fee.\n</p>\n<p>The Redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.\nIf you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the 30-day redemption period GoDaddy may, in its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to another registrant on your behalf.\nDuring the redemption period your domain name may be parked.</p>\n<p>If your domain name is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30-day Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay GoDaddy a redemption fee and redeem your domain name.\nThe redemption fee is currently $80.00 USD and is subject to change under the terms of this Agreement.\nIf you do not redeem your domain name prior to the end of the Registry's Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release your name and it will become available for registration on a first-come-first-served basis.</p>\n<p>Renewal Grace Periods and Redemption Grace Periods vary for different ccTLDs.\nPlease refer to the specific terms for the applicable TLD.\nIn the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this paragraph and the ccTLD terms, the ccTLD terms shall control.</p>\n<p>Our registration expiration notification policy and associated fees are described here.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(C) FREE PRODUCT TERMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event you are provided with free products with the registration of a domain name, you acknowledge and agree that such free products will only be available with a valid purchase and may be terminated in the event the domain name is deleted or cancelled.\nFor free domain names, you acknowledge and agree that you may not change the account associated with such free domain for the first five (5) days after registration.\nIn the event a free domain name is offered with the registration of another domain and if the paid domain name registered fails, then we may, in its sole discretion, either delete the registration of the free domain or refund the difference between the amount paid and the value of the free domain.\nFailed registrations associated with promotional offers may result in the deletion of the free or discounted item or an adjustment between the registered domain price and the value of the discounted item, in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>4.\nTERM OF AGREEMENT.\nTRANSFERS.\nDOMAIN TASTING</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>The term of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as long as you have any domain name registered through GoDaddy.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not transfer any domain name registered through GoDaddy to another domain name registrar during the first sixty (60) days after its initial registration date.\nYou agree that you may not transfer any domain name for ten (10) days after a Change of Account.\n</p>\n<p>You further agree that you will not engage in \"domain tasting\" by using the five (5) day grace period in which a registrant may choose to cancel a domain name and get a full refund of the registration fee as a vehicle to test the marketability or viability of a domain name.\nIf GoDaddy determines (which determination shall be made by GoDaddy in its sole and absolute discretion) that you have been engaging in \"domain tasting\", then GoDaddy reserves the right to (a) charge you a small fee (which fee shall be deducted from any refund issued) or (b) refuse your cancellation/refund request altogether.\nGoDaddy will not charge you a fee if GoDaddy cancels your domain name during the five (5) day grace period due to fraud or other activity outside of your control.\nThe five (5) day grace period does not apply to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that GoDaddy shall not be bound by (i) any representations made by third parties who you may use to purchase services from GoDaddy, or (ii) any statements of a general nature, which may be posted on GoDaddy's website or contained in GoDaddy's promotional materials.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>5.\nUP TO DATE INFORMATION.\nUSE OF INFORMATION AND EXPIRATION</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>You agree to notify GoDaddy within five (5) business days when any of the information you provided as part of the application and/or registration process changes.\nIt is your responsibility to keep this information in a current and accurate status.\nFailure by you, for whatever reason, to provide GoDaddy with accurate and reliable information on an initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.\nFailure by you, for whatever reason, to respond within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by GoDaddy to determine the validity of information provided by you, shall also be considered to be a material breach of this Agreement and a basis for suspension and/or cancellation of the domain name.\nYou agree to retain a copy for your record of the receipt for purchase of your domain name.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that for each domain name registered by you, the following contact data is required: postal address, email address, telephone number, and if available, a facsimile number for the Registered Name Holder and, if different from the Registered Name Holder, the same contact information for, a technical contact, an administrative contact and a billing

international borders, to and from the U.S.\nto the EU, for example.\nAs required by ICANN or for certain ccTLDs (.am, .com.au, .net.au, .org.au, .ca, .cz, .fr, .it, .jp, .co.jp, .kr, .co.kr, .ne.kr,

in the United States, and payment must be in U.S.\nDollars.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Checking Account current and funded.\nYou agree that (i) Check Services Provider or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Checking Account no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither Check Services Provider nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.\nIf for any reason Check Services Provider is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for the Services provided, you agree that Check Services Provider and GoDaddy may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment (plus any applicable fees).\nGoDaddy is not responsible for the actions of Check Services Provider.\nYou agree that if the EFT or bank draft is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge in accordance with the fees permitted by law for each U.S.\nState.\nA help article describing the Check Services Provider and outlining the service charges referenced above can be found here.\nThese fees may be debited from your Checking Account using an EFT or bank draft.\nAll fees are in U.S.\nDollars.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider

hereafter developed.\nSuch notices may not be received if you violate these terms of service by accessing the services in an unauthorized manner.\nYour agreement to these terms of service constitutes your agreement that you are deemed to have received any and all notices that would have been delivered had you accessed the services in an authorized manner.\nFailure to receive such notices for any reason shall not excuse any payment or other obligation to GoDaddy and Check Services Provider.\nYou further expressly authorize GoDaddy and its service providers, including but not limited to Check Services Provider and Complete Payment Recovery Services, Inc., and their affiliates to contact you, via auto-dialer, pre-recorded messages, or any other method, on any of your mobile phone numbers or

PAYMENT OPTIONS</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>GoDaddy offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment Providers (\u201cIPP\u201d).\nIn the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPP\u2019s applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at GoDaddy.\nYou also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected account or payment method, collectively \u201cFunding Sources\u201d.\nIn addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an \u201cExchange Rate Conversion Fee\u201d, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the \u201cIPP Fees\u201d), from your Funding Sources.\nYou understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded.\nYou agree that (i) the IPP or GoDaddy reserve the right to decline a transaction for any reason and (ii) neither the IPP nor GoDaddy shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.\nYou acknowledge that GoDaddy will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor.\nYou acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor.\nIf GoDaddy does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again.\nIn the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your GoDaddy account.\nPayments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If, at the time GoDaddy receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase.\nor (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems.\nor (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, GoDaddy may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source.\nIf the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, GoDaddy reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance or as a bank transfer, when the payment processor cannot refund back to the Payment Method.\nIf you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again.\nYou agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction.\nAccordingly, any refunds issued by GoDaddy will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy offers SEPA Direct Debit (\u201cSEPA\u201d) as a payment method for customers located in Germany.\nIf you choose to use SEPA as a payment method, you are authorizing GoDaddy and Adyen, our payment service provider, to send instructions to your bank to debit your account.\nBy agreeing to these terms you have mandated GoDaddy to collect all of the applicable charges arising under this Agreement.\nThe authorization shall also apply to any new bank account used by you for purchases from GoDaddy.\nWe will notify you of the date of direct debit collection within a reasonable time (the \u201cpre-notification\u201d).\nThis pre-notification will be delivered to you by e-mail at least one (1) business day before payment is collected.\nYou are responsible for making sure that there are sufficient funds in your account to cover any debit payments.\nYou also agree to indemnify GoDaddy against any losses that it may incur if your financial institution withholds payment from GoDaddy for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>(F) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance: (1) you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account.\nand (2) you authorize GoDaddy to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks, or other fees related to your Account.\nIn the event that GoDaddy is unable to successfully charge either the Payment Method associated with a specific Service in your account or your backup Payment Methods when processing Service renewals, GoDaddy may use any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction.\nRegardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, GoDaddy is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your Payment Methods or the in-store credit.\nIn-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal).\nIf you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first.\nIf additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted using GoDaddy\u2019s daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account.\nYou understand and agree that at the time of conversion, GoDaddy may also impose an additional administrative fee.\n</p>\n<p>You can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time through your Account on the GoDaddy website.\nYou acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferable, may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire.\nComplimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance or within any other time period GoDaddy may specify in your Account.\nIn the event that GoDaddy terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.</p>\n<p>You also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by GoDaddy and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf.\nTo the extent any interest may accrue, you agree that GoDaddy is entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>(G) EXPIRED DOMAIN NAME PURCHASES</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For expired domains names purchased through your account, you agree that you are responsible for payment within forty-eight (48) hours of auction close for the successful bid amount plus the one (1) year renewal or transfer fee (from the end of the domain name\u2019s previous registration period), plus ICANN fee, if applicable, or any valid payment method associated with the account, will be charged on the third day following the auction close.\nIf we are unable to collect payment, you may lose the rights to purchase the domain name.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>(H) ROUND UP FOR CHARITY</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you participate in Round Up for Charity, you hereby authorize GoDaddy to either 1) donate an amount selected by you, or 2) round up your transaction to the nearest dollar and donate 100% of the difference, to a small business relief fund (\u201cDonation\u201d).\nGoDaddy will take reasonable steps to ensure your Donation is properly disbursed, in our sole discretion, to qualifying small businesses negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and will not withhold any Donation made by you through Round Up For Charity.\nYou understand your Donation is not eligible for a refund or in-store

CAREFULLY.\nFOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.\n</p>\n<p>(A) <em>Disputes.</em> The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and GoDaddy, except for disputes governed by the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy referenced above and available here.\nFor the purposes of this Section, \u201cDispute\u201d shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and GoDaddy arising under or relating to any GoDaddy Services or Products, GoDaddy\u2019s websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and GoDaddy, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law.\nYOU AND GoDaddy AGREE THAT \u201cDISPUTE\u201d AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR GoDaddy FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION.\nMoreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.\n</p>\n<p>(B) <em>Binding Arbitration.</em> You and GoDaddy further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms.\n(ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce.\n(iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a71, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nand (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED.\nThe arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nIn addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nThe decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p>(C) <em>Small Claims Court.</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court\u2019s jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>\n<p>(D) <em>Dispute Notice.</em> In the event of a Dispute, you or GoDaddy must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the \u201cDispute Notice\u201d).\nThe Dispute Notice to GoDaddy must be addressed to: GoDaddy, 14455 N.\nHayden Rd., Scottsdale, AZ 85260, Attn.: Legal Department (the \u201cGoDaddy Notice Address\u201d).\nThe Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you.\nIf GoDaddy and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or GoDaddy may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section.\nFollowing submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n(E) <em>WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS.</em> YOU AND GoDaddy AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS.\nNEITHER YOU NOR GoDaddy WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nNO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(F) <em>Arbitration Procedure.</em> If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims.\nThe AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nIf there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 19 of this Agreement.\nAll Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator is bound by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nNotwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of \u201cDisputes\u201d as stated above.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nYou may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone.\nArbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or in Maricopa County, Arizona, at your option.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(G) <em>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding.</em> If either you or GoDaddy decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</p>\n<p>i.\nWrite a Demand for Arbitration.\nThe demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered.\nYou can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org (\u201cDemand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules\u201d).</p>\n<p>ii.\nSend one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.\n</p>\n<p>iii.\nSend one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(H) <em>Hearing Format.</em> In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by GoDaddy or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or GoDaddy is entitled.\nThe discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(I) <em>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</em>\n</p>\n<p>i.\nDisputes involving $75,000.00 or less.\nGoDaddy will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nIf you reject GoDaddy\u2019s last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed (\u201cGoDaddy\u2019s last written offer\u201d), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \u201caward\u201d), and the arbitrator awards you more than GoDaddy\u2019s last written offer, GoDaddy will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.00.\n(ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\nand (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.\nThe arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and GoDaddy agree on them.</p>\n<p>ii.\nDisputes involving more than $75,000.00.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p>iii.\nDisputes involving any amount.\nIn any arbitration you commence, GoDaddy will seek its AAA or arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose.\nIn any arbitration GoDaddy commences, GoDaddy will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nGoDaddy will not seek its attorney\u2019s fees or expenses from you in any arbitration.\nFees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>(J) <em>Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year.</em> To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration.\nThe one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed.\nIf not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred.\n</p>\n<p>(K) <em>30-Day Opt-out Period.</em> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY GoDaddy BY E-MAILING LEGALOPTOUT@GODADDY.COM WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW).\nIn the e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account number(s) and state the following: \u201cI wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in GoDaddy\u2019s Universal Terms of Service Agreement.\u201d By providing your information in the method above, you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in GoDaddy's Universal Terms of Service.\nYour opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Universal Terms of Service.\nIn the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms shall contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.\n</p>\n<p>(L) <em>Amendments to this Section.</em> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and GoDaddy agree that if GoDaddy makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to GoDaddy\u2019s address) in these Terms, GoDaddy will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments.\nIf you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing.\nIf you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.\n</p>\n<p>(M) <em>Severability.</em> If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect.\nThe foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions.\nif the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void.\nThe terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>(N) <em>Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies.</em> GoDaddy and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, or the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.\nYou also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.</p>\n<strong>\n<br>\n<strong>23.\nUNCLAIMED PROPERTY.\nDORMANCY CHARGES</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n<br>\nPlease be advised that if a customer has an outstanding account balance (a credit positive balance) for three (3) years or more for any reason, and (i) GoDaddy is unable to issue payment to such customer or (ii) GoDaddy issued payment to such customer in the form of a paper check, but the check was never cashed, then GoDaddy shall turn over such account balance to the State of Arizona in accordance with state law.\nYou acknowledge and agree that in either case (i) or (ii) above, GoDaddy may withhold a dormancy charge in an amount equal to the lesser of $25.00 or the total outstanding account balance associated with such customer.\n</p>\n<strong>\n<br>\n<strong>24.\nSUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n<br>\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and assigns.\n</p>\n<strong>\n<br>\n<strong>25.\nNO THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARIES</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n<br>\nNothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or

10/24/2019</strong>\n<p>(As Approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999)</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>1.\nPurpose</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>This Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the \"Policy\") has been adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\"ICANN\"), is incorporated by reference into your Registration Agreement, and sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you and any party other than us (the registrar) over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by you.\nProceedings under Paragraph 4 of this Policy will be conducted according to the Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the \"Rules of Procedure\"), which are available here, and the selected administrative-dispute-resolution service provider's supplemental rules.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>2.\nYour Representations</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate.\n(b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party.\n(c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose.\nand (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.\nIt is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>3.\nCancellations, Transfers, and Changes</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We will cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to domain name registrations under the following circumstances:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>subject to the provisions of Paragraph 8, our receipt of written or appropriate electronic instructions from you or your authorized agent to take such action;</li>\n<li>our receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such action.\nand/or</li>\n<li>our receipt of a decision of an Administrative Panel requiring such action in any administrative proceeding to which you were a party and which was conducted under this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN.\n(See Paragraph 4(i) and (k) below.)</li>\n<li>We may also cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to a domain name registration in accordance with the terms of your Registration Agreement or other legal requirements.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>4.\nMandatory Administrative Proceeding</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This Paragraph sets forth the type of disputes for which you are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding.\nThese proceedings will be conducted before one of the administrative-dispute-resolution service providers listed here (each, a \"Provider\").</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Applicable Disputes.\nYou are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \"complainant\") asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with the Rules of Procedure, that\n<ul>\n<li>your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights.\nand</li>\n<li>you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name.\nand</li>\n<li>your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.</li>\n</ul>\nIn the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.</li>\n<li>Evidence of Registration and Use in Bad Faith.\nFor the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be present, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith:<ul>\n<li>circumstances indicating that you have registered or you have acquired the domain name primarily for the purpose of selling, renting, or otherwise transferring the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration in excess of your documented out-of-pocket costs directly related to the domain name.\nor</li>\n<li>you have registered the domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that you have engaged in a pattern of such conduct.\nor</li>\n<li>you have registered the domain name primarily for the purpose of disrupting the business of a competitor.\nor</li>\n<li>by using the domain name, you have intentionally attempted to attract, for commercial gain, Internet users to your web site or other on-line location, by creating a likelihood of confusion with the complainant's mark as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of your web site or location or of a product or service on your web site or location.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How to Demonstrate Your Rights to and Legitimate Interests in the Domain Name in Responding to a Complaint.\nWhen you receive a complaint, you should refer to Paragraph 5 of the Rules of Procedure in determining how your response should be prepared.\nAny of the following circumstances, in particular but without limitation, if found by the Panel to be proved based on its evaluation of all evidence presented, shall demonstrate your rights or legitimate interests to the domain name for purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(ii):<ul>\n<li>before any notice to you of the dispute, your use of, or demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to the domain name in connection with a bona fide offering of goods or services.\nor</li>\n<li>you (as an individual, business, or other organization) have been commonly known by the domain name, even if you have acquired no trademark or service mark rights.\nor</li>\n<li>you are making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert consumers or to tarnish the trademark or service mark at issue.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Selection of Provider.\nThe complainant shall select the Provider from among those approved by ICANN by submitting the complaint to that Provider.\nThe selected Provider will administer the proceeding, except in cases of consolidation as described in Paragraph 4(f).</li>\n<li>Initiation of Proceeding and Process and Appointment of Administrative Panel.\nThe Rules of Procedure state the process for initiating and conducting a proceeding and for appointing the panel that will decide the dispute (the \"Administrative Panel\").</li>\n<li>Consolidation.\nIn the event of multiple disputes between you and a complainant, either you or the complainant may petition to consolidate the disputes before a single Administrative Panel.\nThis petition shall be made to the first Administrative Panel appointed to hear a pending dispute between the parties.\nThis Administrative Panel may consolidate before it any or all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided that the disputes being consolidated are governed by this Policy or a later version of this Policy adopted by ICANN.</li>\n<li>Fees.\nAll fees charged by a Provider in connection with any dispute before an Administrative Panel pursuant to this Policy shall be paid by the complainant, except in cases where you elect to expand the Administrative Panel from one to three panelists as provided in Paragraph 5(b)(iv) of the Rules of Procedure, in which case all fees will be split evenly by you and the complainant.</li>\n<li>Our Involvement in Administrative Proceedings.\nWe do not, and will not, participate in the administration or conduct of any proceeding before an Administrative Panel.\nIn addition, we will not be liable as a result of any decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel.</li>\n<li>Remedies.\nThe remedies available to a complainant pursuant to any proceeding before an Administrative Panel shall be limited to requiring the cancellation of your domain name or the transfer of your domain name registration to the complainant.</li>\n<li>Notification and Publication.\nThe Provider shall notify us of any decision made by an Administrative Panel with respect to a domain name you have registered with us.\nAll decisions under this Policy will be published in full over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines in an exceptional case to redact portions of its decision.</li>\n<li>Availability of Court Proceedings.\nThe mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded.\nIf an Administrative Panel decides that your domain name registration should be canceled or transferred, we will wait ten (10) business days (as observed in the location of our principal office) after we are informed by the applicable Provider of the Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision.\nWe will then implement the decision unless we have received from you during that ten (10) business day period official documentation (such as a copy of a complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court) that you have commenced a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted under Paragraph 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure.\n(In general, that jurisdiction is either the location of our principal office or of your address as shown in our Whois database.\nSee Paragraphs 1 and 3(b)(xiii) of the Rules of Procedure for details.) If we receive such documentation within the ten (10) business day period, we will not implement the Administrative Panel's decision, and we will take no further action, until we receive (i) evidence satisfactory to us of a resolution between the parties.\n(ii) evidence satisfactory to us that your lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn.\nor (iii) a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or ordering that you do not have the right to continue to use your domain name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>5.\nAll other disputes and litigation</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>All other disputes between you and any party other than us regarding your domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to the mandatory administrative proceeding provisions of Paragraph 4 shall be resolved between you and such other party through any court, arbitration or other proceeding that may be available.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>6.\nOur involvement in disputes</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>We will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any party other than us regarding the registration and use of your domain name.\nYou shall not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such proceeding.\nIn the event that we are named as a party in any such proceeding, we reserve the right to raise any and all defenses deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to defend ourselves.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>7.\nMaintaining status quo</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>We will not cancel, transfer, activate, deactivate, or otherwise change the status of any domain name registration under this Policy except as provided in Paragraph 3 above.</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>8.\nTransfers during a dispute</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Transfers of a Domain Name to a New Holder</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may not transfer your domain name registration to another holder (i) during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is concluded.\nor (ii) during a pending court proceeding or arbitration commenced regarding your domain name unless the party to whom the domain name registration is being transferred agrees, in writing, to be bound by the decision of the court or arbitrator.\nWe reserve the right to cancel any transfer of a domain name registration to another holder that is made in violation of this subparagraph.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changing Registrars</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may not transfer your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to Paragraph 4 or for a period of fifteen (15) business days (as observed in the location of our principal place of business) after such proceeding is concluded.\nYou may transfer administration of your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending court action or arbitration, provided that the domain name you have registered with us shall continue to be subject to the proceedings commenced against you in accordance with the terms of this Policy.\nIn the event that you transfer a domain name registration to us during the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute shall remain subject to the domain name dispute policy of the registrar from which the domain name registration was transferred.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>\n<strong>9.\nPolicy modifications</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time with the permission of ICANN.\nWe will post our revised Policy at this location at least thirty (30) calendar days before it becomes effective.\nUnless this Policy has already been invoked by the submission of a complaint to a Provider, in which event the version of the Policy in effect at the time it was invoked will apply to you until the dispute is over, all such changes will be binding upon you with respect to any domain name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose before, on or after the effective date of our change.\nIn the event that you object to a change in this Policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain name registration with us, provided that you will not be entitled to a refund of any fees you paid to us.\nThe revised Policy will apply to you until you cancel your domain name registration.\n</p> OK <p>We love taking your call.</p>\n<p> Sign up for news and special offers </p> Sign Up <ul>\n<li> About GoDaddy <ul>\n<li>About
