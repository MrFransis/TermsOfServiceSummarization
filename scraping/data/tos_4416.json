into a separate written agreement signed by a senior corporate officer of ePlus (a \u201cWritten Contract\u201d), in which case the Written Contract will govern.\nCustomer may issue an ordering document or purchase order for administrative purposes only.\nAdditional or different terms contained in any such purchase order will be null and void.\nTerms contained in purchase orders, offers to buy, terms and conditions, and the like shall have no effect.\nany additional or different terms or conditions in any form delivered by Customer are hereby deemed to be material alternations and

carrier inspection and a pickup of damaged products.\nPlease notify your account executive of any damaged shipping containers within the first two (2) days of receipt.\nTwo (2) days is considered a reasonable period of time to conduct the visual inspection of the shipping container, and failure to provide such notice will constitute acceptance in full.\nCustomer also shall notify ePlus of any order shortages or any concealed damages within seven (7) business days.\nThese notification timeframes are necessary so that ePlus may assist customer on a timely basis in obtaining the benefit of any manufacturer warranties as well as filing any shipping claims with the carrier, as applicable.\n</p>\n<p>5.Payment.\nUnless otherwise agreed to in a Written Contract, payment terms are net 30 from

will apply to any amount not received by the due date.\nIn the event ePlus must resort to collection, customer will be responsible for all collections costs, including legal fees.\nIf the \"Bill To\" party is different from the \"Ship To\" party, the \"Ship To\" party is responsible for all payments and late charges if the \"Bill To\" party fails to make payment.\nIn any case where Customer receives products or services but the purchase authorization is provided from a third party to be billed pursuant to a lease or financing arrangement, payment of the invoice will be Customer\u2019s responsibility in the event such third party fails to make timely payment.\n.\nAny communications concerning disputed debts, including any instrument tendered as full satisfaction of the disputed

the customer\u2019s account executive.\nA RMA is valid for ten (10) days from the ePlus issuance date, unless other arrangements are made between the parties at the time of ePlus\u2019 RMA approval.\nThe ePlus RMA number is to be clearly noted on a shipping label affixed to the outer shipping box and any items received into an ePlus return facility without an RMA number or after the elapsed time period will be sent back to the customer at the customer\u2019s expense, unless otherwise agreed to under a Written Contract.\nAny writing, markings or stickers, except shipping label, on the box will void any authorized return.\nExcept in the event of an ePlus or vendor error, customer will be responsible for shipping charges associated with any products being shipped for return, exchange or replacement.\nProducts exchanged or replaced will be shipped back to customer, at customer\u2019s expense.\nReturns must be made via an authorized carrier that allows the package to be tracked, and customer must insure all returned products.\nProducts not eligible for return include, but are not limited to, items that were at end-of-life cycle at the time of order, used or opened software, used consumables, custom configured and built to order products, and products not purchased through ePlus.\nAt ePlus\u2019 discretion, restocking fees may be charged for items which do not qualify for return under this policy.\nSome manufacturers require that defective or Dead on Arrival (DOA) products be returned directly to them, or they may limit the timeframe in which products can be returned.\ntherefore, products that are inoperable at initial use may be eligible for DOA return to or replacement by the manufacturer, subject to the manufacturer\u2019s product defective/DOA return policies.\nIf the product is not returnable under manufacturer guidelines, ePlus will make every attempt to repair or replace the product through the manufacturer\u2019s warranty.\nCustomer should contact its ePlus account executive for further details on the manufacturer warranties.\nePlus technicians test products returned as DOA or defective.\nProducts found not to be defective may be subject to return at the customer\u2019s expense.\nIn any event, ePlus will work with its vendors to facilitate returns for the customer.\n</p>\n<p>7.Services.\nServices provided by ePlus or its subcontractor shall be pursuant to an applicable statement of work executed by the ePlus and Customer.\nAll services shall be deemed accepted upon completion or within five (5) business days of delivery to Customer of a milestone or completion certificate as may be provided in an applicable statement of work.\nCertain services including, but not limited to maintenance, support, extended manufacturer warranty service, and other services provided under a manufacturer\u2019s SKU identified in a purchase order, are sold by ePlus as a reseller without a statement of work.\n(\"Third Party Services\").\nFor such Third Party Services, the third party service provider shall be solely responsible for providing the services to the Customer, and Customer will look exclusively to such third party for any loss, claims, liability or damages arising from or related to the provision of such Third Party Services.\nCustomer hereby releases ePlus and each of its affiliates from any and all claims arising from or relating to the purchase, sale or performance of any such Third Parties Services.\n</p>\n<p>8.Warranties.\nIn the event ePlus performs services pursuant to a statement of work, ePlus represents and warrants that such services will be done in a skillful and workmanlike manner according to those industry standards generally prevailing among consultants performing similar services under similar circumstances.\nCustomer shall notify ePlus of any noncompliance with the foregoing warranty prior to completion of the services or within five (5) business days thereafter.\nePlus or its supplier will pass through to customer any and all applicable hardware or software product warranties of the manufacturer.\nePlus does not provide any warranties on products which it does not manufacture, whether with respect to its design, performance, specifications, functionality or compatibility with customer\u2019s system.\nNo statement or affirmation by ePlus or its agents, by action or word, shall constitute a warranty and Customer agrees torely solely on the manufacturers\u2019 warranties.\nePlus will not be liable for any damage, loss, cost or expense for breach of warranty.\nAs ePlus has no control over the manufacturing of the products sold herein, it cannot and does not indemnify customer for claims by third parties that products infringe any

responsibility in the event such third party fails to make timely payment.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications</strong>.&nbsp.\nAny communications concerning disputed debts, including any instrument

Version History The Board last approved changes to the Code of Conduct on June 18, 2018<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Description of Revisions: &nbsp;</strong>Revisions include: &nbsp;Specifically referencing the Company\u2019s Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy.\nUpdating the Equal Opportunity section to be broader.</p> Introduction <p>ePlus requires all employees to use their judgment, to be accountable for their actions, and to conduct business with integrity.<br>\n<br>\nThe ePlus Code of Conduct outlines the standards of ethical behavior ePlus expects of you in performing the duties of your position with ePlus.\nThroughout this document, we will abbreviate these standards as the \u201cCode.\u201d<br>\n<br>\nYou should keep in mind these important considerations when reading this Code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Code applies to all of our employees, officers and directors regardless of location or<br> position.</li>\n<li>You should follow this Code in letter and in spirit, along with any applicable laws,<br> regulations and other ePlus policies and procedures.</li>\n<li>You may never violate this Code, or any Corporate Policy, simply because someone<br> directs you to do so.\nIf you receive such a request you must refuse, and you should followthe reporting procedures detailed within the Code.</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition to governing conduct among employees, the Code governs conduct between<br>\nemployees and customers, competitors, and the numerous business providers who assist ePlus every day, including vendors and contractors.<br>\n<br>\nThe Code has been approved by the ePlus Board of Directors.\nBecause we want our customers, business partners and investors to understand how we do business, and what they can expect from us, the Code is published on our corporate website, and also in the ePlus Employee Handbook.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Amendments and Waivers<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nePlus will publicly disclose all material amendments and any waivers for senior financial<br>\nofficers, executive officers or directors, to the extent required by law.\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations <p>Obeying the law, both in letter and in spirit, is the foundation on which ePlus\u2019 ethical standards are built.\nAll employees and officers must respect and obey the laws, rules and regulations of the cities, states and countries in which we operate, whether or not specifically addressed in the Code.\nAlthough employees and officers are not expected to know the details of each of these laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine when to seek advice from supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIf a law conflicts with a policy in this Code, you must comply with the law.\nIf you have any questions about conflicts, please discuss with your manager, HR, the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel for additional guidance.\nYou may also seek advice from any attorney or other advisor you select, at your expense.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Antitrust Laws&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nYou must comply with applicable antitrust and similar laws that regulate competition in the countries in which we operate.\nThese laws prohibit:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agreements to fix prices, bid rigging, market allocation and collusion (including price sharing) with competitors;</li>\n<li>Boycotts, certain exclusive dealing arrangements and price discrimination agreements.\nand</li>\n<li>Unfair trade practices, including bribery, misappropriation of trade secrets, deception, intimidation and similar unfair practices.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Environmental Laws&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nePlus complies with all applicable environmental laws, rules and regulations.\nYou should strive to utilize resources appropriately and efficiently and dispose of all waste in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Human Trafficking and Anti-Slavery Laws&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nePlus complies with all applicable anti-slavery and human trafficking laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the Modern Slavery Act 2015.&nbsp;<br>\nWe are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships, and we expect the same high standards from all employees.&nbsp.\nYou are required to&nbsp;avoid any activity that might lead to, or suggest, a breach of our Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Political Process&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nContributions of Company funds or the use of Company assets or facilities for the benefit of political parties or candidates is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Chief Financial Officer or the General Counsel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nAll employees may participate personally in the political process and support political parties and candidates of their choice.&nbsp.\nYou should not in any way suggest that ePlus endorses or supports a political activity or view, however, you may disclose ePlus as your employer, if requested, on a political donation form.&nbsp;<br> Ethical Reporting <strong>Business Records&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nCustomers, suppliers, and government agencies rely upon the integrity of our business records.\nAll business records, such as timecards, purchase orders, invoices, expense reports, certifications and financial records must accurately reflect the transactions of the Company in accordance with all applicable requirements.&nbsp.\nWe will not create or permit false or misleading entries to be made in the records of the Company under any circumstances.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Public Disclosures&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nePlus requires full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that are filed with, or submitted to, the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and in other public filings and communications.&nbsp.\nThe standards for accounting and financial reporting require the proper recording of, and accounting for, revenues, costs, expenses, assets, and liabilities.&nbsp.\nIf you have responsibility for, or any involvement in, these areas, you must understand and adhere to these rules and prepare all reports, books and records of ePlus with care and honesty, and adhere to all internal control policies and procedures.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nViolations of laws associated with accounting and financial reporting can result in fines, penalties, and imprisonment and they can lead to a loss of public faith in the Company.\nIf you become aware of any action related to accounting or financial reporting that you believe may be improper, you should submit your concerns to the Chief Financial Officer or General Counsel.\nAlternatively, employees can use the ePlus internal web-based communication channel, VOICE IT, or call the Hotline, which is managed by a third-party service provider.\nCallers have the option to remain anonymous.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Expenses&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nEmployees are entitled to reimbursement for reasonable business-related expenses, but only if those expenses were actually incurred and fall within the parameters detailed within the ePlus Travel and Expense Policy.\nBusiness expense reports must be accurate, include all supporting documentation, and be submitted in a timely manner.\nSubmitting an expense account for meals not eaten, miles not driven, airline tickets not used, or any other expense not incurred as submitted, is dishonest reporting.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Data Privacy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nePlus typically does not possess personal information, except with regard to our employees.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;We take appropriate steps to protect information relating to individuals, whether they are employees, customers, investors or vendor partners.&nbsp.\nWe are responsible for collecting, processing and transferring personal data only for lawful and legitimate business purposes, and use care in safeguarding the confidentiality and security of personal data, and in respecting personal privacy.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Workplace Privacy&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nAs an ePlus employee, it is important that you understand that ePlus may take the following steps when you access any ePlus network or system, or use any device, regardless of ownership, to conduct ePlus business:&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Access, search, monitor, and archive all data and messages sent, accessed, viewed, or stored;</li>\n<li>Conduct physical, video, or electronic surveillance (as permitted by law).\nand</li>\n<li>Review IM, phone, and similar records, and web-surfing history.</li>\n</ul> Our People ePlus\u2019 success depends on its employees.\nIt depends on people who innovate and are committed to growing our business responsibly, people who dedicate themselves to really satisfying customers, helping partners, and people who are accountable for achieving challenging goals with unwavering integrity.\nPeople who are leaders, who appreciate that to be truly great, we must continually strive to better ourselves, and help others improve.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Equal Opportunity&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nePlus employs, trains, promotes and compensates individuals based on merit, job-related qualifications and abilities.\nePlus is committed to providing equal opportunity without regard to race, color, religion/religious creed, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), gender, gender expression, gender identity, transgender, sexual orientation, national origin (including ancestry), age, marital status (including same-sex marriages), genetic information/predisposition/carrier status, physical/mental disability or medical condition, military/veteran status, or any other classification protected under federal, state, or local law.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>No Harassment&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nAny kind of harassment by or against our employees is prohibited.&nbsp.\nAll employees must comply with our Sexual Harassment Policy.&nbsp.\nProhibited conduct includes the making of unwelcome sexual advances or engaging in any other conduct with sexual overtones which interferes with an individual\u2019s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.&nbsp.\nAll instances of sexual harassment should be reported, and will be investigated, as described in the Sexual Harassment Policy.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Health and Safety&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nePlus is committed to providing employees with a safe and healthy work environment.\nAll employees have a responsibility for maintaining the health and safety of the work environment by following environmental, safety and health rules and practices, and for reporting accidents, injuries, and unsafe equipment, practices or conditions.&nbsp;<br>\nAll employees are expected to perform their company-related work in a safe manner, free from the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Workplace Violence&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nWe all deserve to work in an environment that is free from violence or hostility.\nePlus will not tolerate any threatening, hostile or abusive behavior by employees, or from anyone with whom an ePlus employee comes into contact in the course of doing business for ePlus.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYou must report any instance of violence, hostile behavior or brandishing of weapons on Company property to your supervisor or Human Resources immediately.\nFirearms are not permitted on ePlus property, except where expressly permitted by law.&nbsp.\nIn cases of imminent danger, you should call 911 or local law enforcement first, and then the General Counsel, Human Resources, or your manager.\nSupervisors are expected to inform the VP of Human Resources or the General Counsel no later than 24-hours after any reports or act or threat of violence, even if the situation has been addressed and resolved.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Leadership&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe expect our leaders to set an example and be role models in every respect.\nAs leaders, you must ensure that employees have sufficient information to comply with laws and policies, and create a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance.\nThis culture must encourage all employees to raise concerns when they arise.\nWe must never sacrifice ethical and compliant behavior in the pursuit of business objectives or generate an environment where employees are fearful to raise concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWorking with Others The integrity of ePlus is a key component of our reputation, trustworthiness and service.\nThe people that ePlus conducts business with expect and deserve fair, honest and respectful information and service.\nYou are responsible for your role in the delivery of that standard of service.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Relations with Government Officials and Employees&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may not make any payments to or for the benefit of any government official or employee in order to secure business or to obtain special concessions.\nRelations with government representatives, even where personal friendships may be involved, must be legal, in good taste and such that full public disclosure would in no way damage ePlus\u2019 reputation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Relations with Contractors and Vendors&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nRelationships with our contractors and vendors are to be managed in a fair and reasonable manner, consistent with applicable laws and ethical business practices.\nThe selection of contractors and vendors will be made on the basis of objective criteria, including quality, technical excellence, price, delivery, adherence to schedules, service and maintenance of adequate sources of supply.\nPurchasing decisions will be based on the vendor\u2019s ability to meet our needs, and not on personal relationships and friendships.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Authority to make ePlus Commitments&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nThe ePlus management system and contracting processes are designed to help ePlus protect its assets and to provide the appropriate controls needed for ePlus to run its business effectively with its customers, business partners, vendors and other third parties.\nAuthorities are defined within the ePlus \u2018Authority Matrix\u2019.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nCommitments must be visible to ePlus accounting to help ensure the accuracy of ePlus\u2019 financial results.\nMaking business commitments outside of the most current and internally published Authority Matrix is prohibited.&nbsp.\nConflicts of Interest ePlus respects the right of all employees to engage in personal activities outside of work.\nHowever, each of us has the responsibility to avoid activities and relationships which conflict with our job responsibilities or the interests of ePlus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nAny employee activity that may involve a conflict of interest, or may reasonably create an appearance of a conflict of interest, must first be approved by the Chief Financial Officer, with the assistance of the Chief Compliance Officer or Company legal counsel, and must be in compliance with the Company\u2019s Related Person Transaction Policy.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Examples of Conflicts of Interest include:<br>\n<br>\n</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Holding a significant and undisclosed financial interest in a current or reasonably anticipated customer, supplier or competitor of ePlus, or serving as an employee consultant or director of that business.&nbsp.\n(Holding a small amount, such as less than 5%, of the publicly-traded stock of our suppliers or customers would not constitute a conflict of interest.)</li>\n<li>Directing ePlus business to a supplier owned or managed by a relative.</li>\n<li>Accepting \u201cspiffs\u201d from vendors other than in accordance with our Gift Policy.</li>\n<li>Using confidential ePlus information for personal benefit, or for the benefit of others.</li>\n<li>Performing work or rendering services for any entity who does, or seeks to do, business with ePlus, outside the normal course of your employment, without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer (or the Board of Directors, if you are an executive officer).</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Gifts&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nAlthough the exchange of gifts and entertainment can promote a successful working relationship and goodwill, you must follow all applicable laws and company rules and procedures.\nYou should assume that any gift given or received will be made public, and should not offer or accept any gift that might reasonably be viewed negatively if disclosed.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nePlus has a Gift Policy that addresses common gift situations, and with which all employees are required to comply.&nbsp.\nePlus also has an online reporting tool for employees to report gifts given or received that are not otherwise addressed under the policy.&nbsp.\nThe Gift Policy can be found on eConnect, in the Human Resources\u2019 policies section.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Improper Payments&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is never appropriate to offer or receive bribes, kickbacks or improper payments.\nThis prohibition applies to dealings with current and potential customers, suppliers, representatives, consultants or other business partners seeking to establish a relationship with ePlus.&nbsp.\nMany countries and U.S.\nstates have laws prohibiting bribery of government officials and commercial bribery.&nbsp.\nIn particular, employees should be aware of, and comply with, the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K.\nBribery Act.&nbsp;<br>\nIf you are unsure if a payment or gift is inappropriate or illegal, you should seek guidance from the General Counsel.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Personally Gaining From Corporate Opportunities&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou owe a duty to ePlus to advance its legitimate interests.\nYou cannot take any business opportunity you learn of as a result of your employment or use any ePlus property for your personal benefit or for the benefit of a family member.\nFor example, you should not acquire any interest in a company when you know that ePlus may take or is taking steps to acquire an interest in that company.\nIf you learn of a business opportunity you are interested in pursuing that is&nbsp;within ePlus\u2019 existing or proposed lines of business, you should inform your supervisor, ePlus\u2019 Chief Financial Officer or, in the case of executive officers, the Board of Directors.\nYou should not personally pursue the business opportunity until ePlus decides not to pursue it and grants approval for you to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Participation on Boards of Directors&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is a conflict of interest to serve as a director of a company that is in competition with ePlus.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nEmployees and officers should not serve as a director of any other for-profit company, other than on behalf of ePlus, without the approval of the Chief Financial Officer or, in the case of the Chief Financial officer, the Chief Executive Officer.&nbsp.\nIn the case of any employee who is also a director of ePlus, service as director of any other for-profit company must be approved by ePlus\u2019 Board of Directors.&nbsp.\nConfidential and Proprietary Information <strong>Confidentiality&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\nCustomers, vendors, and others disclose confidential information to ePlus for business purposes.\nEach employee has a responsibility to protect and maintain the confidentiality of this information.&nbsp.\nFailure to properly protect customer and third-party information may damage our relationships with these important business partners, and may result in legal liability.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nePlus owns all information, in any form (including electronic information), that is created or used in support of its activities.\nThis information is a valuable asset and ePlus expects you to protect it from unauthorized disclosure.\nThis information includes ePlus customer, vendor, business partner and employee data.\nFederal, state and foreign laws may restrict the use of this information and may penalize you if you use or disclose it.\nYou should protect information pertaining to ePlus\u2019 competitive position, business strategies and information relating to negotiations with employees or third parties and share it only with employees who need to know it in order to perform his or her job.&nbsp.\nNothing in this policy shall be deemed to interfere with employee disclosure rights protected by law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Intellectual Property and Proprietary Information&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nYou should carefully maintain and manage the intellectual property rights of ePlus to which you have access, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, licenses and trade secrets, to preserve and protect their value.\nIn addition, you should respect the intellectual property rights of others.\nIf you violate other\u2019s intellectual property rights, you and ePlus could face substantial liability, including criminal penalties.\nIntellectual property that you create during the course of your employment belongs to ePlus.\nYou must share any innovations or inventions you create with your supervisor so that ePlus can take steps to protect these valuable assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Insider Trading&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nFederal and state securities laws and ePlus\u2019 policies prohibit you from:&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchasing or selling ePlus securities while you know material, nonpublic information about ePlus.\nand </li>\n<li> Disclosing material, nonpublic information, except as permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to better protect non-public information, all confidential Company business information and information of our customers, vendors and business partners, should be disseminated internally only on a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d basis.\nFor more information, employees should refer to the ePlus Insider Trading Policy which is posted on the Corporate Intranet and is included as an Appendix to the ePlus Employee Handbook.&nbsp;<br>\nBecause of the complexity of insider information and insider trading, and the severity of the punishments involved, which can include criminal prosecution, you should seek the advice of ePlus\u2019 General Counsel on any questions regarding this subject.\nIn some cases, you may want to retain an attorney on your own to advise you.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nRequests for information from the media, analysts, attorneys, law enforcement officers and others.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nWhat may appear to be an innocent request for information could result in serious harm to our company.\nBe alert to requests for information from outside of ePlus.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYou should not initiate contact with the media, analysts, attorneys or others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIf you receive a request for information from these sources, you must direct the caller to the Company\u2019s main telephone number (703) 984-8400 or 888-482-1122.\nThe call will then be directed to the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Investor Relations Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Inadvertent Disclosure&nbsp;</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo avoid inadvertent disclosure, never discuss with any unauthorized person confidential information.\nFurthermore, you should not discuss such information even with authorized ePlus employees if you are in the presence of others who are not authorized, for example, at a trade show reception or in a public area.\nYou should also not discuss such information with family members or with friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass the information on to someone else.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nIf you ever suspect or know that you or someone else has inadvertently disclosed information that is confidential or non-public, you must contact the General Counsel immediately.&nbsp.\nProtection and Proper Use of Company Assets Every employee must properly use, protect, and safeguard Company property, both tangible and intangible, as well as the property of our customers, vendors and business partners that is in our possession.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nePlus\u2019 assets include our physical assets and our extremely valuable proprietary information, such as ePlus\u2019 intellectual property and ePlus confidential information, noted in the previous section.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nCare should be taken to ensure that assets are not misappropriated, loaned to others, or sold or donated, without appropriate authorization.\nePlus will take appropriate steps, including legal measures, to protect its assets.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYou have an obligation to care for and protect the equipment that has been provided to you.\nIf you use ePlus equipment at your home or off site, you must take precautions to protect it from theft or damage, just as if it were your own.\nIf you leave ePlus employment, you must immediately return all Company-owned equipment.&nbsp.\nHow To Report Possible Violations Every employee has a responsibility to promptly report any issue or concern he believes, in good faith, may constitute a violation of the Code or any other ePlus Policy.\nWe also encourage you to come forward if you encounter a situation that \u201cjust doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201d&nbsp.\nYour commitment to take action to share your concerns will help to ensure an ethical workplace for everyone.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYou should report suspicions to only those people who absolutely need to know.\nThis protects people from allegations that may not be proven and prevents the possible destruction of evidence.\nThe Company does not allow retaliation for reports made in good faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nYou have several options available for voicing you concerns:&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by talking with your immediate manager.\nePlus managers have a duty to promote an open and honest environment where members of their teams can feel comfortable about voicing their concerns without fear of retaliation.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>If you do not feel comfortable discussing your concern with your manager, or after seeking assistance you do not feel the outcome resolved your issue, please contact a Human Resources representative.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>If you do not feel comfortable with either of the first two options, or after seeking assistance, you do not feel the issue was appropriately addressed or resolved, please contact the Chief Financial Officer or the General Counsel.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>In addition to the options already listed, you can submit comments or concerns via the Company\u2019s internal web-based communication channel \u201cVOICE IT\u201d.\nVOICE IT submissions are received by HR and the General Counsel.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Also, ePlus has retained the services of an external provider, to manage a confidential Whistleblower Hotline for ePlus employees.\nThe Hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nYour concern will be documented by the third party.\nAn independent ePlus Board member, the General Counsel and the Vice President of Human Resources receive details of all ePlus-related calls made, directly from the third-party provider.</li>\n</ul>\nNon-ePlus employees should contact the Company\u2019s main telephone number (703) 984-8400 or 888-482-1122.\nThe call will then be directed to the General Counsel, the Chief Financial Officer, or the Investor Relations Department.\nReady to learn more?<p>Preparation and success go hand in hand.\n<br>Connect with us or use the form.\n<br>+1
