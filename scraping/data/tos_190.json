confirm the price of an item until you order.\nDespite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced.\nIf the correct price of an item sold by Amazon is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.\nOther merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.\n</p>\n<p>We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.</p> APP PERMISSIONS\n<p>When you use apps created by Amazon, such as the Amazon App or Kindle App, you may grant certain permissions to us for your device.\nMost mobile devices provide you with information about these permissions.</p> SANCTIONS AND EXPORT POLICY\n<p>You may not use any Amazon Service if you are the subject of U.S.\nsanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S.\nlaw imposed by the governments of the country where you are using Amazon Services.\nYou must comply with all U.S.\nor other export and re-export restrictions that may apply to goods, software (including Amazon Software), technology, and services.</p> OTHER BUSINESSES\n<p>Parties other than Amazon operate stores, provide services or software, or sell product lines through the Amazon Services.\nIn addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses.\nIf you purchase any of the products or services offered by these businesses or individuals, you are purchasing directly from those third parties, not from Amazon.\nWe are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant, the offerings of any of these businesses or individuals (including the content of their Web sites).\nAmazon does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties.\nYou should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.\n</p> DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY <p>THE AMAZON SERVICES AND ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS,

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nAMAZON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE AMAZON SERVICES, INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR OTHER SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE AMAZON SERVICES, AMAZON'S SERVERS OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SENT FROM AMAZON ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.\nTO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, AMAZON WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OF ANY AMAZON SERVICE, OR FROM ANY INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, PRODUCTS (INCLUDING SOFTWARE) OR

OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.</p> DISPUTES\n<p>\n<strong>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Amazon Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Amazon or through Amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court</strong>, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, Amazon will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong> If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial</strong>.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p> APPLICABLE LAW <p>By using any Amazon Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Amazon.</p> SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY\n<p>Please review our other policies, such as our pricing policy, posted on this site.\nThese policies also govern your use of Amazon Services.\nWe reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time.\nIf any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p> OUR ADDRESS <p>\n</p>Amazon.com, Inc.\nP.O.\nBox

sites that display our interest-based ads.\nAdvertisers and other third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on an interest-based ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in a particular geographical area or users who purchased or browsed for classical music).\nSome third-parties may provide us pseudonymized information about you (such as demographic information or sites where you have been shown ads) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p>\n<p>Third party advertisers or advertising companies working on their behalf sometimes use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads, directly to your browser or device, and they may

personalization of certain Alexa features.\nYou can also create a voice profile, so Alexa can call you by name and do more to personalize your experience.\nWhen Alexa recognizes your voice

shipping address, speed, or preferences might affect Prime eligibility.\nCertain purchases may only be entitled to Standard Shipping because of their size, weight, and other shipping characteristics.\n</p>\n<p>We may exclude products with special shipping characteristics at our discretion.\nThe Prime section of our Help pages provides information about eligible items, shipping cost, shipping speed, and shipping destinations.\n</p> Other Benefits and Supplemental Memberships <p>\nClick here for information about additional Prime benefits.\nWe also offer Prime members

discretion.\n</li>\n<li>\nWe may send you email and other communications related to Prime and your Prime membership (regardless of any settings or preferences related to your Amazon

terms.\n</li>\n<li>\nPrime members are not permitted to purchase products for the purpose of resale, rental, or to ship to their customers or potential customers using Prime benefits.\n</li>\n<li>\nSome Prime benefits may require certain purchase thresholds, have quantity or shipping address limitations, or require members to meet specified criteria in order to access them.\n</li>\n<li>\nFrom time to time, Amazon may choose in its sole discretion to add or remove Prime membership benefits.\n</li>\n</ul> Fees and Renewal <p> The membership fee for Prime is stated in the Prime section of our Help pages.\nFrom time to time, we may offer different membership terms, and the fees for such membership may vary.\nThe Prime membership fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms.\nTaxes may apply on either or both of the membership fee and the reduced shipping charges for Prime.\n</p>\n<p>If you sign up for your Prime membership through us and are billed by us, then the billing terms described below will apply to your membership.</p>\n<p>If all eligible payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your membership fee, you must provide us a new eligible payment method promptly or your membership will be canceled.\nIf you provide us with a new eligible payment method and are successfully charged, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.\n</p>\n<p>UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR PRIME MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY ELIGIBLE PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.\n</p>\n<p>If you signed up for your Prime membership through a third party and are not billed directly by us, then the billing terms provided by the third party will apply to your membership.\n</p> Promotional Trial and Qualification-Based Memberships <p>We sometimes offer certain customers various trial or other promotional memberships, which are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offers.\nTrial members may at any time (through Your Account) choose not to continue to paid membership at the end of the trial period.\n</p>\n<p> If you sign up for a qualification-based Prime membership (including but not limited to Prime Student and Prime for qualifying customers with an EBT or Medicaid card), you will receive certain Prime benefits for the reduced rate specified in the Prime section of our Help page.\nTo sign up for and use a qualification-based Prime membership, you must meet the eligibility conditions described on the applicable enrollment page and provide any required documentation.</p> Agreement Changes <p>We may in our discretion change these Terms, Amazon.com's Conditions of Use and Privacy Notice, or any aspect of Prime membership, without notice to you.\nIf any change to these terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions.\nYOUR CONTINUED MEMBERSHIP AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR MEMBERSHIP.\n</p> Termination by Us <p>We may terminate your Prime membership at our discretion without notice.\nIf we do so, we will give you a prorated refund based on the number of full months remaining in your membership.\nHowever, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates these Terms or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of the Prime membership, or is harmful to our interests or another user.\nOur failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.\n</p> Limitation of Liability <p>IN ADDITION TO OTHER LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS IN AMAZON.COM'S CONDITIONS OF USE, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE LAST MEMBERSHIP FEE YOU PAID.\nTHIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND WILL SURVIVE CANCELLATION OR TERMINATION OF YOUR PRIME MEMBERSHIP.</p> Disputes\n<p>\n<strong>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to these Terms or your use of Prime, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Amazon or through Amazon.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court,</strong> except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, Amazon will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.</strong> If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p> ", "created_at": "2018-07-17

1, 2020</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>These Terms of Use are part of an agreement between you and Amazon.com Services LLC (together with its affiliates, \"Amazon\" or \"we\") regarding use of the Amazon Appstore for Android and associated software, services and purchases (\"Amazon Appstore\").\nBefore you use the Amazon Appstore or download any Apps made available through it, please read these Terms of Use, the Amazon.com Privacy Notice at https://www.amazon.com/privacy, the Amazon.com Conditions of Use at https://www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse, and all rules and policies related to the Amazon Appstore (including, but not limited to, any rules or usage provisions specified on any product detail page or on any help or other informational page for the Amazon Appstore) (collectively, the \"Agreement\").</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU USE THE AMAZON APPSTORE, YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nThe Amazon Appstore</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the Amazon Appstore, you can access, browse, purchase and download software games, applications and other digital products (\"Apps\").\nApps include any content, ads, services, technology, data, in-app products (including Amazon-Sold In-App Products, as defined in Section 2.3) and other digital materials included in or made available through an App you download or use via the Amazon Appstore (including after you download it).\nApps also include any updates, upgrades and other changes and versions that you later use or download from us.\nThe party that provides an App for distribution is the \"Publisher\" of the App.\nMost Apps are provided and licensed to you by third-party Publishers.\nWe may make some Apps available via the Amazon Appstore at no charge and others for a price, as further described on our App detail pages.\nFrom time to time, we may offer sales, give-aways and other promotions in the Amazon Appstore.\nWe may modify or discontinue any of these promotions at any time without notice to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nUsing and Downloading Apps</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 General.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After you order an App and pay any corresponding price to us, you may download a copy of the App for your personal use to a device on which you have installed and signed in to our Appstore Software (as defined in Section 3.1).\nApps can be used only on devices that use the Android platform and meet certain other technical requirements.\nGenerally, App device requirements are described on or through our App detail pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2 Trial Access to Apps.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may offer free trial and other limited versions of Apps so you can preview Apps before you purchase the full version.\nThese versions may have limited features, may restrict permitted time of use and may contain other limitations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 In-App Products.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may offer digital products for sale that are intended to be accessed or used within an App, such as additional or enhanced functionality, media content, or subscription access to content or services (\"Amazon-Sold In-App Products\").\nNot all products and services available for purchase within an App are Amazon-Sold In-App Products.\nYou will be able to identify Amazon-Sold In-App Products because you will see our logo when making the purchase and will complete the purchase using your Amazon Appstore payment method.\nAmazon-Sold In-App Products are subject to any use, access and other restrictions described on, or linked from, the Amazon-Sold In-App Product detail page or otherwise provided in this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>Other than for purchases of Amazon-Sold In-App Products, we are not a party to, and have no responsibility for, any payment or purchase transactions you make through an App (unless we expressly state otherwise in writing, such as in connection with purchases made through our Amazon Shopping App).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 Subscriptions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you purchase an Amazon-Sold In-App Product that is a subscription or start a free trial for such a subscription, your subscription will automatically continue at the regular subscription price.\nUNLESS YOU SET A SUBSCRIPTION TO NOT AUTOMATICALLY RENEW BEFORE ITS RENEWAL DATE, YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.\n</p>\n<p>We may terminate a subscription at any time, for example, if the applicable Amazon-Sold In-App Product is no longer available.\nIf we terminate a subscription before the end of its term, you will receive a prorated refund.\nWe reserve the right to change subscription terms and prices from time to time, effective as of the beginning of the next subscription term.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.5 All Sales Final.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All purchases of Apps and Amazon-Sold In-App Products are final, except as expressly stated in Digital Products Return Policy.\nOnce you have purchased an App or Amazon-Sold In-App Product, we encourage you to download (if applicable) and access it promptly to be sure you have received it.\nIf you are unable to complete a download or access an App or Amazon-Sold In-App Product, please contact Amazon customer service for assistance.\nOnce you purchase an App or Amazon-Sold In-App Product and we make it available to you, you bear responsibility for completing the download (if applicable) and for all risk of loss after downloading or accessing the App or Amazon-Sold In-App Product, including any loss due to a device malfunction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.6 Downloading and Availability of Apps after Purchase.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Once you have paid for an App, you may download copies of the App for your personal use to compatible Android devices.\nEach time you download an App to a particular device, you will first be required to download and install the Appstore Software, if it is not already available on the device, and to sign in to the Appstore Software using the user name and password for the Amazon.com customer account that you used to buy the App.\nWe will usually continue making Apps you have purchased available to you in our Amazon Appstore so that you can download additional copies under the terms of this Agreement, but that is not always the case, and we may limit or disable further downloads of an App due to licensing restrictions or for other reasons.\nCertain Apps rely on cloud-based services provided by the Publisher for some or all of their functionality.\nThese Apps may not function properly or may become inoperable if the Publisher discontinues those services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.7 Updates to Apps.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Publisher of an App may provide us with updates to that App from time to time.\nWe may automatically install updates to your Apps, or prompt you to install the updates, depending on how your Amazon.com account and Appstore Software settings are configured.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.8 Ratings.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide age and content ratings for Apps that are based on information provided to us by the Publisher or other third parties.\nWhile we require Publishers to provide accurate information regarding the content of their Apps, we cannot ensure that App ratings are accurate or that Apps do not include content that is offensive, indecent, or objectionable.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nUse of and Restrictions on Apps and Appstore Software</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1 Appstore Software.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may make available to you software that you need to install on your device in order to download Apps purchased from the Amazon Appstore to that device and to access or use Apps on that device (the \"Appstore Software\").\nTerms contained in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use apply to your use of the Appstore Software.\nFor additional terms that apply to certain third party software, click here.\nThe Appstore Software may allow you to access or use the Amazon Appstore from a device, and purchases of Apps or Amazon-Sold In-App Products that you make via the Appstore Software will be charged to a payment method associated with the Amazon.com account you used to sign in to the Appstore Software.\nPublishers may choose to protect their Apps using a digital rights management (\"DRM\") system implemented through the Appstore Software.\nAppstore Software includes any software we include in an App to enable the DRM or for other purposes.\nIf you uninstall the Appstore Software from your device or sign out of your Amazon.com account in the Appstore Software, you will not be able to access or use any Apps on your device that Publishers have protected with DRM.\nYou may not attempt to disable, bypass, modify, defeat, or otherwise circumvent the DRM or any other security or content protection system used in connection with the Amazon Appstore.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2 Information Provided to Amazon.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Amazon respects your privacy, and the Appstore Software will not access files or other information on any device where your Apps are located that are not used by or otherwise related to the Appstore Software or performance of the Apps.\nThe Appstore Software and Apps will provide Amazon with information relating to the download, use and performance of the Appstore Software and your Apps, as well as information regarding the devices on which you download and use the Appstore Software or Apps.\nFor example, the Appstore Software and Apps may provide Amazon with information about the device type, network connectivity, location of the device running an App, information about when an App is launched, individual session lengths for Apps, or why an App may not be working.\nAny information we receive is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice located at <strong>www.amazon.com/privacy</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3 Separate Licenses to Use Apps.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your use of an App will be governed by the terms and conditions of an end user license agreement between you and the Publisher of the App (a \"EULA\").\nThe EULA for an App includes the terms set forth below (the \"Standard EULA\") and any additional end user license terms included in the App (the \"Publisher EULA\").\nIf there is a conflict between the Standard EULA and the Publisher EULA, the Standard EULA will control.\nThe Publisher has the right to enforce the EULA against you.\nIf you do not want to comply with the EULA for an App, you must not use that App.\nAmazon is not a party to the EULA for any App (unless Amazon is the Publisher of that App).\nAs used in this Section 3.3, the term \"App\" does not include any Appstore Software included within an App (your use of Appstore Software is instead governed by Sections 3.1 - 3.2 above).\nThe Standard EULA includes the following end user license terms, and if the App does not include a Publisher EULA, these terms will constitute the entire EULA between you and the Publisher: </p>\n<p>(i) The Publisher is the licensor of the App.\n</p>\n<p>(ii) If the App does not include a Publisher EULA that specifies App license rights, Publisher grants you a limited, nontransferable license to download and use the App only for your personal and noncommercial purposes.\n</p>\n<p>(iii) You may download additional copies of the App to compatible Android devices that have been linked to the Amazon.com customer account that you used to buy the App in accordance with Amazon's rules and policies for the Amazon Appstore.\n</p>\n<p>(iv) Any information that Publisher collects from you or your device will be subject to any Publisher EULA, privacy notice, or similar terms that the Publisher provides to you, and will not be subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice.\n</p>\n<p>(v) You may not modify, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the App in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in the App, unless otherwise expressly authorized in writing by Publisher.\n</p>\n<p>(vi) The App is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties.\nUnless otherwise expressly stated in the Publisher EULA, Publisher or its licensors own all title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the App, and the App is licensed, not sold.\n</p>\n<p>(vii) You acknowledge and agree that Amazon has no responsibility or liability with respect to your use of the App or any content or functionality in the App.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.4 Compliance with Law and Reservation of Rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You will use Apps in compliance with all applicable laws, including all export and re-export restrictions and regulations of the Department of Commerce and other United States agencies and authorities that may apply to any App.\nWe reserve the right to change, remove, suspend, or disable any App without notice or liability.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nGeneral</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.1 Changes.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may modify, suspend or discontinue the Amazon Appstore, in whole or in part, at any time without notice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 Geographic Restrictions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Amazon Appstore is operated in the United States.\nWe may restrict access to the Amazon Appstore from other locations.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3 Suspension and Termination.\nAmendments.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your rights under this Agreement will automatically terminate without notice from us if you fail to comply with its terms.\nIn case of such termination, you must cease all use of the Amazon Appstore and the Appstore Software, and we may immediately revoke your access to the Amazon Appstore without notice to you and without refund of any purchases.\nOur failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.\nWe may amend any of this Agreement's terms at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on the Amazon.com website.\nYour continued use of the Amazon Appstore or the Appstore Software after the effective date of the revised Agreement terms constitutes your acceptance of the terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4 Contact Information.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For communications concerning this Agreement, please write to Amazon, Attn: Legal Department, P.O.\nBox 81226, Seattle, WA 98108-1226.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.5 Disputes / Binding Arbitration.\nAny dispute or claim arising from or relating to the Agreement or the Amazon Appstore is subject to the binding arbitration, governing law, disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability and all other terms in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use at https://www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse.\nYou agree to those terms by entering into the Agreement or by using the Amazon Appstore.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.6 Limitation of Liability.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Without limiting the Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use: (i) in no event shall our or our software licensors' total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the Appstore Software exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\nand (ii) in no event shall our total liability to you for all damages arising from your use

Kindle Unlimited.\nThese Terms are between you and Amazon.com Services LLC and/or its affiliates (\u201c<strong>Amazon.com</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>We</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>Us</strong>\u201d) and govern our respective rights and obligations.\nPlease note that your use of the Amazon.com website and your Kindle Unlimited membership are also governed by the agreements listed and linked to below, as well as all other applicable terms, conditions, limitations, and requirements on the Amazon.com website, all of which (as changed over time) are incorporated into these Terms.\nIf you sign up for a Kindle Unlimited membership, you accept these terms, conditions, limitations and requirements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nAmazon.com Conditions of Use\n</li>\n<li>\nAmazon.com Privacy Notice\n</li>\n<li>\nKindle Store Terms of Use\n</li>\n<li>\nAudible Service Conditions of Use </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>The Program</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As a member of Kindle Unlimited, you may read Kindle books and listen to Audible audiobooks from a designated list of titles an unlimited number of times for so long as you are a member of the program.\nFrom time to time, we may add or remove titles from the program and we make no guarantee as to the availability of specific titles or the minimum number of titles available.\nIf you are located outside of the United States, the program may not be available to you.\nIf your membership ends, you will no longer have access to the titles you selected from the program.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees and Renewal</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The membership fees for Kindle Unlimited are stated in our Help pages.\nFrom time to time, we may offer different membership terms, and the fees for such membership may vary.\nMembership fees may be subject to tax and are non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your Kindle Unlimited membership will automatically continue and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable membership fees and any taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you.</p>\n<p>If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your membership fees, your membership will be canceled unless you provide us with a new payment method.\nIf you provide us with a new payment method and are successfully charged before your membership is cancelled, your new membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.</p>\n<p>From time to time we may also offer non-recurring memberships.\nThe provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those memberships.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Membership Cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You may cancel your membership by visiting Your Account https://www.amazon.com/youraccount and adjusting your membership settings.\nIf you cancel your membership, you will not receive a refund of any membership fees already paid.\nWhen your membership is cancelled, the titles you have selected from the program will be removed from your account, devices and applications.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Restrictions</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We reserve the right to accept or refuse membership in our discretion.\nYou may not transfer or assign your membership or any Kindle Unlimited benefits.\nWe may take reasonable actions necessary to prevent fraud, including placing restrictions on the number of titles that can be accessed from the program at any one time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Promotional Trial Memberships</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We sometimes offer certain customers various trial or other promotional memberships, which are subject to these Terms except as otherwise stated in the promotional offers.\nTrial members may at any time (through Your Account) choose not to continue to paid membership at the end of the trial period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Agreement Changes</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We may in our discretion change these Terms, the Kindle Store Terms of Use, Audible Service Conditions of Use, Amazon.com Conditions of Use and Amazon.com Privacy Notice, or any aspect of Kindle Unlimited membership, without notice to you.\nIf any change to these Terms is found invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that change is severable and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining changes or conditions.\nYour continued membership after we change these Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes.\nIf you do not agree to any changes, you must cancel your membership.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Termination by Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We may terminate your membership at our discretion without notice.\nIf we do so, we will give you a prorated refund based on the number days remaining in your membership.\nHowever, we will not give any refund for termination related to conduct that we determine, in our discretion, violates these Terms or any applicable law, involves fraud or misuse of the membership, or is harmful to our interests or another user.\nOur failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Terms will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Disputes.\nLimitation of Liability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any dispute or claim arising from or relating to these Terms or your membership is subject to the binding arbitration, governing law, disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability and all other terms in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use.\nYou agree to those terms by signing up for Kindle Unlimited.\nWithout limiting the disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use, our total liability under these Terms will not exceed the total membership fees you paid in the twelve months prior to the claim.\n</p>\n<p> Was this information helpful? </p> Yes No <p> Thank you for your feedback.\n</p>\n<p> Please select what best describes the

1, 2020</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nThese Terms of Use are part of an agreement between you and Amazon.com Services LLC (together with its affiliates, \u201cAmazon\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) regarding use of Amazon GameCircle and associated software and services (\u201cGameCircle\u201d).\nBefore you use GameCircle, please read these Terms of Use, the Amazon.com Privacy Notice at http://www.amazon.com/privacy, the Amazon.com Conditions of Use at http://www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse, and all rules and policies related to the Amazon GameCircle (including, but not limited to, any rules or usage provisions specified on any help or other informational page for GameCircle) (collectively, the \u201cAgreement\u201d).</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIF YOU USE GAMECIRCLE, YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THE AGREEMENT.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n1.\nAmazon GameCircle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>GameCircle provides game-related features, such as Whispersync for Games, achievements, leaderboards, and friends, for certain software games, applications and other digital products (\u201cApps\u201d).\nAn App may offer all, some or none of the features of GameCircle.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n2.\nUsing GameCircle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n2.1 Signing Into GameCircle.</strong> When using an Amazon device, you will be automatically signed in to GameCircle under the Amazon account used to register the device.\nWhen playing an App that offers GameCircle (a \u201cGameCircle Enabled App\u201d) on non-Amazon devices, you will be given the option to sign in to GameCircle using your Amazon account.\nOnce you sign in to GameCircle in one GameCircle Enabled App on a non-Amazon device, you may be automatically signed in to GameCircle for all future GameCircle Enabled Apps you play on that device.\nGameCircle cloud-based features such as Whispersync for Games and sharing with your friends are only available if you are signed into GameCircle.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n2.2 Your GameCircle Nickname.</strong> If you are signed into GameCircle, we will assign a default nickname for you.\nYou may change that nickname at any time.\nYour nickname will be public, unless you choose to use GameCircle in \u201chidden\u201d mode.\nYou may not select a nickname that is the real name of, or otherwise impersonates, another person, or is illegal, obscene, offensive, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n2.3 Leaderboards and Achievements.\n</strong>GameCircle and GameCircle Enabled Apps may include leaderboard and achievement features that allow you and others to track your scores and achievements (for instance, what levels you\u2019ve completed in a game) and compare those scores and achievements with those of others.\nIf you are signed into GameCircle, your scores and achievements for GameCircle Enabled Apps may be displayed on public leaderboards and shared with App publishers and will be displayed with your nickname unless you\u2019ve chosen to use GameCircle in \u201chidden\u201d mode.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n2.4 Whispersync for Games.\n</strong>GameCircle includes Whispersync for Games, which stores your game play information for GameCircle Enabled Apps in the Amazon cloud and syncs that information to other devices on which you are signed in to GameCircle.\nThis allows you to keep your game play synchronized across multiple devices and to retain your game progress if you install a GameCircle Enabled App on a new device.\nThe publisher of an App determines whether to enable Whispersync for Games for that App and what game play information is stored and synced.\nWe are not liable if your game play information is not stored or available through Whispersync for Games for any reason.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n2.5 Friends.\n</strong>GameCircle includes a friends feature which allows you to become \u201cfriends\u201d with other GameCircle users.\nYour friends will be able to see information about you, including the games you own, your scores and achievements, when you play games, and other game play information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n3.\nUse of GameCircle and GameCircle Software</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n3.1 GameCircle Software.</strong> We may make available software, either on a standalone basis or incorporated in an App or other software, that you need to install on your device in order to use GameCircle on that device (\u201cGameCircle Software\u201d).\nTerms contained in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use at http://www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse apply to your use of the GameCircle Software.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n3.2 Information Provided to Amazon.</strong> The GameCircle Software and GameCircle Enabled Apps may provide Amazon with information regarding your use of GameCircle and GameCircle Enabled Apps, as well as information about the device on which you use GameCircle and GameCircle Enabled Apps.\nFor example, the GameCircle Software and GameCircle Enabled Apps may provide Amazon with your nickname, scores, achievements, friend information, game play information, how often and for how long you play GameCircle Enabled Apps, information about the device type, network connectivity, and location of the device running a GameCircle Enabled App, and information on why GameCircle may not be working.\nAny information we receive is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice located at www.amazon.com/privacy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n4.\nGeneral</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n4.1 Changes.\n</strong>We may modify, suspend or discontinue GameCircle, in whole or in part, at any time without notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n4.2 Termination.\nAmendments.</strong> Your rights under the Agreement will automatically terminate without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms.\nWe may also terminate your right to use GameCircle at any time.\nIn case of such termination, you must cease all use of GameCircle, and we may immediately revoke your access to GameCircle without notice to you.\nOur failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights.\nWe may amend the Agreement at our sole discretion by posting the revised terms on Amazon.com.\nYour continued use of GameCircle after any amendment evidences your agreement to be bound by it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n4.3 Contact Information.\n</strong>For communications concerning the Agreement, please write to Amazon, Attn: Legal Department, P.O.\nBox 81226, Seattle, WA 98108-1226.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n4.4 Disputes/Binding Arbitration.\nAny dispute or claim arising from or related to the Agreement or GameCircle is subject to the binding arbitration, governing law, disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability and all other terms in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use at http://www.amazon.com/conditionsofuse.\nYou agree to those terms by entering into the Agreement or using GameCircle.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n4.5 Limitation of Liability.</strong> Without limiting the disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use, in no event will our or our licensors' total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) arising out of or related to your use or inability to use GameCircle or GameCircle Software exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).\nThese limitations will apply to you even if the remedies fail of their essential purpose.</p>\n<p> Was this information helpful? </p> Yes No <p> Thank you for your

Conditions of Use (collectively, the \"Agreement\") before using the Amazon Silk browser software and related services (collectively, \"Amazon Silk\").\nBy choosing a browser operating mode and installing, using, or accessing Amazon Silk, you accept and agree to be bound by this Agreement.\nIf you don't want to be bound by the Agreement, exit the browser and do not install, use, or access Amazon Silk.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Privacy Information:</strong> Personally identifiable information collected through Amazon Silk is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice, which is incorporated and made a part of this Agreement.\n<p>Amazon Silk optimizes and accelerates the delivery of web content by using Amazon's cloud computing services.\nTherefore, like most Internet service providers and similar services that enable you to access the Web, the content of web pages you visit using Amazon Silk passes through our servers and may be cached to improve performance on subsequent page loads.\n</p>\n<p>Amazon Silk routes secure (SSL) web page requests directly from your computer to origin servers so they do not pass through Amazon servers.</p>\n<p>Amazon Silk also temporarily logs web addresses -- known as uniform resource locators (\"URLs\") -- for the web pages it serves.\nWe do not associate these URLs with your identity, and we generally do not keep this information for longer than 30 days.\n</p>\n<p>You can also choose to operate Amazon Silk with Cloud Features turned off.\nDisabling Cloud Features allows web pages generally to go directly to your computer rather than pass through our servers.\nAmazon Silk with Cloud Features turned off still delivers a fast browsing experience, but does not take advantage of Amazon's cloud computing services to speed up web content delivery.\n</p>\n<p>If you use Amazon Silk on an Amazon device, your device may send crash reports to Amazon.\nThese reports may contain identifiers such as IP or MAC addresses.\nWe may use these crash reports to help us troubleshoot the browser and improve its performance.\n</p>\n<p>All text you enter in Amazon Silk's address bar is sent to a default search engine.\nThe initial default search engine is selected by Amazon Silk, and we may change the default search engine in the future without notice to you.\nIf you would like, you may choose to use a different search provider as your default search engine.\nThe privacy policy of the selected default search engine applies to information sent to it.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Amazon Silk Updates and Upgrades:</strong> Amazon Silk is offered by Amazon Web Services, Inc (\"Amazon\").\nThe terms of the Agreement govern the Amazon Silk browser software and any updates or upgrades to the Amazon Silk browser software that Amazon may provide that replace and/or supplement the original browser, unless such update or upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.\n(Collectively, the original software and any updates or upgrades shall be referred to as the \"Software.\") This Agreement also covers services related to the Software.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>License and Restrictions:</strong> The license and restrictions governing your use of Amazon Silk, including the Software, are described in the Amazon.com Conditions of Use.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Changes:</strong> Amazon may change, suspend, or discontinue Amazon Silk, or any part of Amazon Silk without notice or liability.\nIf Amazon elects to provide customer support of any kind, it may terminate that support at any time without notice to you.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Termination:</strong>You may terminate the Agreement at any time by uninstalling the Software or ceasing your use of Amazon Silk.\nIn addition, your rights under the Agreement will automatically terminate without notice from Amazon if you fail to comply with any term of the Agreement or if Amazon discontinues Amazon Silk.\n<p>In case of any termination, you must cease all use of Amazon Silk, including the Software.\nAmazon may also terminate your right to use Amazon Silk at any time, and in such event may modify it to make it inoperable.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Disclaimer of Warranties:</strong> WITHOUT LIMITING THE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IN THE AMAZON.COM CONDITIONS OF USE, AMAZON AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT TO YOU THAT: (A) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR FREE FROM ERROR, OR (B) ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED BY YOU AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Miscellaneous Provisions:</strong> Amazon reserves the right to make changes to the Agreement at any time by posting the revised terms on the Amazon.com website.\nYour continued use of the Software following any such changes will constitute your acceptance of those changes.\nAmazon's failure to enforce your strict compliance with the Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of its rights.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2018-07-17 10:11:42.217692", "updated_at": "2020-12-11 14:56:47.777668"}, {"id": 61, "name": "Backup and Restore FAQ", "url":

enabled, backs up your Fire tablet settings, email and wireless configurations, bookmarks, search history and more to the Cloud.\nBackup and Restore runs when your Fire tablet is idle and connected to Wi-Fi, so please connect your Fire tablet to Wi-Fi on a regular basis.\nBackup data can be used to quickly set up a new device or to restore your existing device after a reset.\nWe'll expand this feature over time so that additional items are backed up.</p> How is my backup data stored? <p>Backup data is encrypted and stored in the Cloud.\nBackup data can be used to help you easily set up a new device or restore data to your existing device after a reset.\nWe seek to make your backup data available for at least a year from the last time you used your device.</p> Can I turn off Backup and Restore and delete my backup data?\n<p>Yes.\nYou can disable Backup and Restore for any Amazon account registered on your device by going to Settings &gt.\nDevice Options &gt.\nBackup &amp.\nRestore and tapping \"OFF\".\nOnce disabled, backup data currently associated with your device and Amazon account will be deleted.\nThis process will not delete backup data from other devices you may have or for other accounts on your device.</p> Is Backup and Restore the same thing as Amazon Cloud Drive?\n<p>No.\nAmazon Cloud Drive stores your photos, personal videos, and files, while Backup and Restore stores information about your Amazon account and Fire tablet, such as settings, email and wireless configurations, bookmarks and search history.\nFor more information on Amazon Cloud Drive, go to

do location services work on Fire tablets? <p>When you enable location services, the approximate location of your device is determined based on information including: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nfor all devices, the networks detected by your device (like Wi-Fi routers, their signal strengths, and the type of security they use).\n</li>\n<li>\nfor cellular enabled devices (like a 4G Fire tablet), the cellular networks detected by your device (like the signal strengths of cell towers).\n</li>\n<li>\nfor devices with a GPS feature, latitude and longitude, altitude, direction, and the accuracy of these readings.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Amazon and third-party apps and websites use location information to provide you location services.\nWe also may use and store this information to provide and improve our services, such as voice services, the Maps app, and Find Your Device, and to monitor the performance and accuracy of our location services.\nSimilarly, we use your location to process your mapping-related requests and improve the Maps experience.\nAll information we collect is subject to the Amazon.com Privacy Notice.</p> How is my location data used by third-party apps? <p>A wide range of apps and websites may access your location information, including, for instance, those that provide directions, weather information, or information on local attractions or restaurants.\nThese apps and websites may collect, use, and share your location data in different ways depending on the type of location services they provide.\nAny location data and other information collected by a third-party app or website are subject to that app's or website's privacy policy and other terms, not the Amazon.com Privacy Notice.\nYou should carefully review the privacy policies and other terms for third-party apps and websites before installing or using them on your device to understand how they work and how each app or website provider will use your information (including whether they directly access or use Wi-Fi, GPS, or other features to gather information for other purposes).</p> How can I tell which third-party apps have access to location services on my Fire tablet?\n<p>For apps downloaded from the Amazon Appstore, you can tell which apps have access to location services by checking whether the \u201cpermissions\u201d listed on the app\u2019s detail page in the Amazon Appstore includes access to location information.\nA location icon will appear in the upper right corner of your device (near the battery life icon) when an app or website is accessing location information from your device.\n</p> Can I turn off location services?\n<p>Yes, you can turn off location services at any time by going to the Settings menu of your device and disabling the feature.\nFor information about how to disable specific devices, click here.\nIf you disable location services, you may not be able to access or use certain apps or features on your device that require those services.</p> What are Enhanced Location Services?\n<p>When enabled, Enhanced Location Services help us improve Maps and other services by allowing us to store location history and associate it with your Amazon account.\nYou may enable Enhanced Location Services by going to Settings &gt.\nLocation Services.</p> Can I delete my location history collected by Enhanced Location Services?\n<p>Yes, you can choose to delete the location history collected by Enhanced Location Services from this device and currently associated with your Amazon account by visiting the Manage Your Content and Devices page on Amazon.com.\nYou also can contact customer service.\nThis process will not delete location information collected from your other devices and is limited to deletion of data
