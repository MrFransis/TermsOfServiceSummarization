case.\n<strong> Before filing a claim against NETGEAR, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting legal@netgear.com </strong>.\nNETGEAR will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting You in writing via email.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission to this email address, You or NETGEAR may bring a formal proceeding.</p> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER <p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You and NETGEAR agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims arising out of, in connection with, or relating to NETGEAR\u2019s Terms and Conditions, Products, and relationship with You, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising or efficacy of the NETGEAR Products.\nAll disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator.\nThis agreement includes any claims against NETGEAR\u2019s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of NETGEAR.\nArbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding.\nIt uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and is subject to limited review by courts.\n<br>\n<br>\n3.2&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;To the extent possible under Your local law, the arbitration will take place in Santa Clara County, California.\nThe arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.\nNETGEAR\u2019s Products and relationship with You involve interstate commerce, and this arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>et seq.</em>).\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND NETGEAR AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n3.4&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Further, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, consolidated action or private attorney general action.\nThis arbitration agreement does not stop You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, who may seek relief against us on Your behalf.\nIf this specific provision, known as the \u201cClass Action Waiver,\u201d is found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.\n<br>\n<br>\n3.5&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You agree that if NETGEAR makes any future, material change to this arbitration provision, You may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to <strong>legal@netgear.com</strong> .\nYour decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which You have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.\n<br>\n<br>\n3.6&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;This arbitration provision is optional.\nYou may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to <strong>legal@netgear.com</strong> within thirty (30) calendar days of purchasing Your NETGEAR Product.\n<br>\n<br>\n3.7&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS <p>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;NETGEAR may at its discretion modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change these Terms and Conditions at any time.\nEach such modification will take immediate effect upon notification to You.\nNETGEAR may provide You with notices, including those regarding changes to these Terms and Conditions, by email, regular mail, text message, updating its website, or other reasonable means now known or hereinafter developed.\n<br>\n<br>\n4.2&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Your continued use of the Product following any such notifications constitutes Your acceptance of such modifications and Your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.\nIf You do not agree to any modification of these Terms and Conditions, Your sole remedy is to discontinue Your use of the Product.\nThe most current version of these Terms and Conditions will be available on the NETGEAR website and supersedes previous versions.</p> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES <p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Subscriptions.\nNETGEAR offers certain products and services on a subscription basis

an order for Purchased Content within 24 hours of purchase or rental (or, for customers in the European Union, within 14 days from the date of purchase), except You may not cancel an order for Purchased Content once You have downloaded it.</p> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;PAYMENT AND AUTOMATIC RENEWAL <p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Payment.\nYou agree that You will pay for the Subscription Services and other Purchased Content You purchase from NETGEAR, and that NETGEAR (or its third party payment processor) may charge Your credit card or other payment processing account (as chosen by You) for those Services and Purchased Content.\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You further acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, subscription preferences that You select, changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and You authorize us (or our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING NETGEAR WITH A VALID CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT PROCESSING ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.2&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Billing Account and Payment Method.\nYou will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for a Service.\nYou can access and change Your billing information and payment method by by emailing <strong> support@netgear.com .\n</strong> Additionally, You agree to permit NETGEAR to use any updated account information regarding Your selected payment method provided by Your issuing bank or the applicable payment network.\nIf You want to designate a different payment processing account or if there is a change in Your credit card other payment processing account status, You must change Your information online or by contacting customer support, which may temporarily disrupt Your access to the Services while NETGEAR verifies Your new payment information.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.3&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Recurring Payments.\nWhen You purchase the Subscription Services on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or annually), <strong>You agree that You are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to NETGEAR by the method and at the recurring intervals You have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by You or by NETGEAR</strong>.\nBy authorizing recurring payments, You are authorizing NETGEAR to store Your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from Your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to Your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, \u201cElectronic Payments\u201d).\nSubscription fees are generally charged in advance of the applicable subscription period.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.4&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<strong> Automatic Renewal and Trials .\nIf Your account is set to automatically renew or is in a trial period, YOU AGREE THAT NETGEAR MAY CHARGE YOU AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS YOU NOTIFY NETGEAR IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL.\nNETGEAR may revise subscription service rates by providing You at least thirty days\u2019 notice prior to the next charge.\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n6.5&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<strong>Automatic Renewal Sign-Up.</strong> To sign up for Subscription Services with recurring payments, You must complete the required registration details, and agree that Your subscription may automatically renew for the same applicable term until You

process.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You agree that NETGEAR may automatically charge the subscription fee to the credit or charge card provided and associated with Your account at the beginning of each period at the frequency You have selected unless and until You cancel the subscription option.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You must cancel prior to the subscription fee being charged to the credit or charge card.\nIf You signed up at a promotional rate any renewals past the promotional period will be charged at the then effective subscription fee.\nAccess to Your Services will not be established until NETGEAR or its agent has verified that the credit card information is valid, accurate and that Your credit card account is in good standing.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You will receive an e-mail reminder of Your auto-renewal thirty (30) days prior to any applicable renewal.\nYou will also receive a reminder email a day before Your date of renewal reminding You that Your subscription option will be renewed for an additional period.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.6&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Late Payments.\nNETGEAR may suspend or terminate Your Services without notice upon rejection of any credit card charges or if Your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks the return of payments previously made to NETGEAR for the Subscription Services.\nYou agree NETGEAR may charge interest on all amounts due that remain unpaid for thirty (30) days or more.\nThe monthly interest will equal up to one point five percent (1.5%) of the past due amount or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, until the past due amount and interest is paid.\nSuch rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to NETGEAR.\nNETGEAR may refer Your account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n6.7&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Hardware Equipment.\nIf Your Subscription Service includes hardware equipment, you will be charged a non-refundable shipping cost for NETGEAR to ship the equipment to you.\n<br>\n<br>\n6.8&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Reactivation.\nIf for any reason You need to reactivate a terminated Subscription Service, You may be charged a reactivation fee</p> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;CANCELLATION POLICY AND PROCEDURE <p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Cancellation of Your Subscription Services by You.\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Cancellation Procedure.\nYou may request termination of Your account and use of the Subscription Services at any time by communicating such

part in any trial-period offer, You must cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period to avoid incurring new charges.\nIf You do not cancel the trial Service(s) by the end of the trial period, NETGEAR will charge you for the

paid in connection with your Service(s) are non-refundable.\n<br>\n<br>\n7.2&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Termination of Your Subscription Services by NETGEAR.\n<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, NETGEAR retains the absolute right to immediately disable and/or terminate Your Service at any time (without observing any notice period) if:\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You are in breach of any provision of these Subscription Terms.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You have demonstrated (regardless of whether directly or through Your actions or statements or otherwise) that You do not intend to comply with these Subscription Terms or NETGEAR\u2019s Terms and Conditions.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Your subscription charges are refused for any reason.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You misuse the Services.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;You alter Your system or use the Services or software

party.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Any supplier or partner of NETGEAR providing the Services to or together with NETGEAR decide to terminate the provision of the Services or any parts thereof (either worldwide or in the country where You are a resident or from where You are Using the Services) or if any supplier or partner of NETGEAR decides to terminate the entire relationship with NETGEAR and regardless of the reason of such termination, including where any supplier or partner of NETGEAR are of the opinion that the provision of the Services or parts thereof to You or to NETGEAR or together with NETGEAR are no longer commercially feasible;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nNETGEAR or any supplier or partner of NETGEAR providing the Services to or together with NETGEAR are required by applicable law to terminate the provision of the Services or parts thereof (for example if due to changes in applicable law or due to court rulings or judgments the Services or parts thereof become or are considered unlawful).\nor\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Required by law.\n<br>\n<br>\nUpon any such termination of Your account by NETGEAR, You will remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees and charges relating to Your use of the Subscription Services before the effective date of such termination, and NETGEAR will give You a pro-rated refund of any of Your paid for, but unused, Services fees that will remain unused because of NETGEAR\u2019s termination.\nTermination of the Services may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with Your membership, including \u201c<strong>Content</strong>\u201d (i.e., all content that is made available in the Services or accessible as part of or by the use of the Services (including audio and sound files, data files, images, music, photographs, software, videos and written text)).\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Hardware Equipment.\nIf Your Subscription Service includes hardware equipment, upon cancellation or termination, you must follow NETGEAR\u2019s instructions in returning the equipment in good condition.\nIf you do not return the equipment within the specified time, you will be charged for the fair market value of the equipment.\nYou may also be required to pay shipping charges associated with the return.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;User Content Back-Ups.\nYou are entirely responsible for backing up Your \u201c<strong>User Content</strong>\u201d (<em>i.e.,</em> any information, materials, documents, media files or other content You upload, transmit, create, post, display or otherwise provide on or through the Services) stored with NETGEAR or through the Services to another location outside the Services (e.g., by means of creating local copies or backups with specialized online backup Services) to avoid loss of Your User Content and other data.\nIf NETGEAR disables access to Your Service, You may be prevented from accessing the
