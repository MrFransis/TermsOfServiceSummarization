Localbitcoins\u2019 accounts are personal and intransferible.\nAn individual user account should be verified and operated only by the person who created it.\nCompany accounts must be registered and verified through the company verification system.\nSelling or giving away LocalBitcoins\u2019 user accounts is not allowed.\n</p>\n<p> In order to decrease the risk of money laundering and illicit use of the platform, LocalBitcoins does not provide service to companies associated with the following industries: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Initial Coin Offerings </li>\n<li> Weapons or defence manufacturers </li>\n<li> Casinos and gambling firms </li>\n<li> External certified accountants, approved accountants, tax specialist accountants, external tax advisors and company auditors </li>\n<li> Lawyers, notaries, other independent legal professionals </li>\n<li> Nonprofit, political and religious organisations </li>\n</ul> Advertising and Trading <p> Users who create ads in LocalBitcoins are able to define different Bitcoin pricings in their ads according to criteria such as payment method and customer groups.\nAdvertisers are not allowed to use ad pricing for manipulating the market (e.g.\nattempting to force prices up or down) or make use of abusive margins in pricing equations.\nAcceptable pricing margins must take into account the ongoing practices of the targeted regional market.\nFor example, if bank transfer ads in Finland have margins between 10-20% above or below market average, setting up an advertisement with 200% margin will be deemed as abusive pricing.\nIt is not allowed to keep multiple active ads in the same payment method category for the same currency in the same country unless the ads in question have at least 3% price difference or target different customer groups (e.g.\ntrade limits are different or there are new users restrictions).\n</p>\n<p> LocalBitcoins allows users to create ads for non listed payment methods under the categories \u201cOther Online Payment\u201d, \u201cOther Online Wallet\u201d and \u201cOther Remittance\u201d accordingly.\nHowever, LocalBitcoins does not allow advertising the following payment methods due to security reasons: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Amazon Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> Apple Store Gift Card </li>\n<li> Ebay Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> iTunes Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> Starbucks Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> Steam Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> Walmart Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> Gift Card Code </li>\n<li> NetSpend Reload Pack </li>\n<li> BPAY Bill Payment </li>\n<li> OneCard </li>\n<li> PaySafeCard </li>\n<li> PCS vouchers </li>\n<li> Neosurf </li>\n<li> TransCash </li>\n<li> CashLib </li>\n<li> Reloadit </li>\n<li> Monero altcoin </li>\n<li> Dash altcoin </li>\n<li> Postal order </li>\n<li> Cash by mail </li>\n<li> Cash in Person </li>\n</ul>\n<p> It is not allowed to provide misleading or incorrect information through advertisements and trade chats or to set up excessive trade requirements, such as unreasonable verification requirements (e.g.\nimages of bank cards displaying numbers or social security cards).\nAdditional verification in trade chats is only allowed for ads that have peer to peer verification option enabled.\n</p>\n<p> When creating an ad in LocalBitcoins, buyers and sellers are not allowed to advertise other products or services than Bitcoin or to post spamming content.\nBuyers and sellers must not use advertisements or trade chats to redirect trading partners to conduct trade related communication outside of LocalBitcoins\u2019 trade chats.\nIt is not allowed to request trade sensitive information (e.g., payment details and verification items) to be sent through other channels than LocalBitcoins\u2019 trade chats, such as social media, external messaging services or other exchanges.\n</p>\n<p> It is not allowed to use threatening and abusive language (e.g.\nprofanity) or to share nocive links in trade chats or in feedback.\nFeedback must not include personal details or links to external services.\nIt is not allowed to share information and images provided in LocalBitcoins\u2019 trade chats externally for purposes unrelated to the trade in question.\n</p>\n<p> In the case of disputed trades, it is not allowed to attempt to obstruct dispute resolution by being unresponsive in disputed trade chat or by providing false or incomplete evidence.\nAs each opened trade is a new agreement, only the information and evidence provided through the new trade chat created are valid for that agreement, therefore receipts and payment details sent through other channels or previous trade chats might not be acceptable as proof of trade in the case of a dispute.\nEach user must become acquainted with the terms of service of the payment method provider and cooperate with dispute resolution as requested.\nLocalBitcoins dispute moderators do not contact external parties on behalf of users.\n</p> Wallet <p> LocalBitcoins wallets support only Bitcoin.\nTransactions sent to LocalBitcoins receiving wallet addresses that contain unsupported cryptocurrencies cannot be reversed or recovered.\n</p>\n<p> As stated in the Terms of Service, LocalBitcoins does not support any kind of criminal activity and our services must not be used for criminal purposes.\nIt is not allowed to use LocalBitcoins trading platform or wallet services for receiving or sending funds related to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Money laundering (including but not limited to e.g.\nreceiving, sending or maintaining bitcoins from criminal proceeds at LocalBitcoins wallets) </li>\n<li> Financing of terrorism </li>\n<li> Fundraising </li>\n<li> Acquisition of illicit items </li>\n<li> Other criminal activity </li>\n</ul>\n<p> LocalBitcoins\u2019 wallet services must not be used to send or receive transactions associated with predatory practices, such as ponzi schemes, scamming, hacking and phishing.\nIt is not allowed to use LocalBitcoins wallet as a Bitcoin mixer.\n</p> Contacting staff <p> When contacting LocalBitcoins\u2019 staff through support tickets, in disputed trade chats or in LocalBitcoins\u2019 official social media channels, it is not allowed to use abusive or threatening language or provide false information and evidence.\n</p>\n<p> LocalBitcoins\u2019 main support channel is the support ticket system.\nLocalBitcoins support agents do not contact users via phone calls.\nLocalBitcoins support never requests users\u2019 password or other security credentials (e.g.\ntwo-factor verification codes) or demands deposits in order to release locked Bitcoins.\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-05-17 22:42:40.5023", "updated_at": "2021-05-17 20:49:29.478675"}, {"id": 6066, "name": "Terms of Service",

entity may place several advertisements on our platform, created by different company account holders, but such advertisements may not be fully overlapping (e.g.\nusing the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country).\n</p> Identity Verification <p> In order to ensure LocalBitcoins remains a safe platform for all of our users, and for us to comply with mandatory legal obligations which we are subjected to, we may require you to verify your identity to access the services we offer.\nIdentity verification may be required when you create advertisements, pass certain trade volume limits, during trade disputes, fraud investigations, and to ensure account ownership.\nAs part of our ID verification process we require you to provide us with your full name as well as documents and photographs that verify your identity (e.g.\nvalid passport).\n</p>\n<p> In certain situations (e.g.\ndue to the regulatory or legal requirements) we may require enhanced identity verification.\nThis may include requirements to verify details or sources of funds regarding payments you have made or received during trades on LocalBitcoins as well as bitcoin transactions that you have sent or received from your account.\n</p> Bitcoin Trading <p> You can place one or more advertisements on our platform when you wish to offer to buy or sell bitcoins.\nWe have the right to restrict the number of your advertisements for security reasons and reasons of suspected misconduct or fraudulent activity.\n</p>\n<p> Bitcoin trades (\"trade\" or \"contact\") to either buy or sell bitcoins are initiated by responding with a trade request to advertisements created by other users.\nWith the trade request you are making a legally binding offer and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the trade (such as exchange rate, bitcoin amount and terms of payment) as determined by the advertiser to whom you are sending the trade request to.\nWhen sending the trade request, you may need to select from options made available in the advertisements or accept any freeform terms and conditions set out by the advertiser in the Terms of trade field and displayed on the advertisement page.\nThe terms and conditions of the trade must be accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nIn case of discrepancy, the terms of this Agreement will have precedence.\n</p>\n<p> When you are selling bitcoin it is your responsibility to check that you have received payment for the full amount, that the payment is not made by a third party to the trade, and that it was made according to your instructions given to the buyer.\nAfter you have released a trade to the buyer it is not possible to cancel, reverse, dispute or otherwise recover or return the bitcoins to you.\n</p>\n<p> Payments made by buyers must be sent by the same person or entity who is the holder of the account or the company account.\nReceiving, making, providing, or attempting to receive, make or provide payments to or from third parties is forbidden and considered a violation of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p> All communication relevant to the trade must happen in the trade chat on our platform in such a way that it is readily available for LocalBitcoins support staff to review.\nConsequently, communications on our platform are not considered private communications between you and other users, but LocalBitcoins is also a party to such communications, and may access and otherwise process such communications in accordance with the Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> Communication that has not occurred on our platform or that has been hidden, encrypted or otherwise obstructed from view is not taken into consideration during dispute review and dispute resolution.\n</p> Disputing Bitcoin Trades <p> When a buyer and a seller are in disagreement over a trade either party or LocalBitcoins can start a dispute (\"Disputed trade or \"dispute\") to initiate a mediation process on the bitcoin held in escrow.\nDisputed trades are reviewed and resolved by LocalBitcoins support staff.\n</p>\n<p> Disputes can only be started on trades that are open and marked as paid by the buyer but not yet released by the seller.\nTrades that are not marked as paid by the buyer, have been released by the seller, cancelled by the buyer, automatically cancelled, or already disputed and resolved are considered completed and cannot be disputed, reversed, or altered.\n</p> Unresponsiveness <p> When you have placed advertisements which have not expired or you are involved in a bitcoin trade it is important that you remain active and available at least until the trade is completed, canceled, or resolved.\nThis means that you must be able to provide a response to a request by LocalBitcoins support in a disputed trade within twenty-four (24) hours or you may be deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be resolved against you for this reason alone.\n</p> Dispute review <p> During a dispute review LocalBitcoins support may give you instructions that you are required to follow.\nThe instructions given to you may require you to provide proof of payment, proof that you have or have not received payment (e.g.\nbank transaction history), additional ID verification, photo.\naudio.\nor video evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by LocalBitcoins.\nFailure to follow the instructions may lead to the dispute being resolved against you.\n</p> Dispute resolution criteria <p> A disputed trade is most commonly resolved by LocalBitcoins support moving the escrowed bitcoin to the buyer or the seller of the disputed trade once the dispute resolution criteria are met.\n</p>\n<p> In rare situations where neither party fulfill the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria, LocalBitcoins may decide to resolve the dispute by splitting the escrowed bitcoin between the buyer and the seller evenly or unevenly.\n</p> Dispute resolution criteria <p> LocalBitcoins can resolve a disputed trade in the favor of a bitcoin buyer when one of the following criteria are met: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> The buyer has made payment according to the instructions provided by the seller in the trade chat, advertisement terms of trade, or advertisement payment details and the buyer has provided sufficient proof that the payment was made according to these instructions.\n</li>\n<li> The seller has become unresponsive.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> LocalBitcoins can resolve a disputed trade in the favor of a bitcoin seller when one of the following criteria are met: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> The buyer has not provided payment or not provided payment in full </li>\n<li> The payment made by the buyer has been held/frozen/stopped by the payment provider </li>\n<li> The buyer has not provided payment according to the instructions provided to them by the seller in the trade chat, advertisement terms of trade or advertisement payment details.\n</li>\n<li> The payment is made by a third party to the trade OR the payment is made from a payment account not registered in the name of the buyer.\n</li>\n<li> The buyer is not responding </li>\n</ul>\n<p> If the buyer or the seller of a disputed trade provides fraudulent information or fraudulent documents or makes false claims or otherwise tries to force a certain outcome of a disputed trade the dispute may be immediately resolved against the user.\n</p> Incorrect dispute resolution <p> If you believe LocalBitcoins has resolved a dispute you are a party of in a way which is not in accordance with these terms you have a right to request a review.\nTo request a review you need to notify us and specifically request a review by contacting customer support no later than 120 days after the dispute resolution has been given.\n</p> Limitation of Liability regarding dispute resolution <p> You acknowledge that the dispute resolution is a service that we provide and which will be conducted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nYou agree and accept that we assume no responsibility for the outcome thereof and in any event our liability for dispute resolution is limited to the amount of fee payable to us.\n</p>\n<p> In the event of an incorrect dispute resolution which is corrected in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, we assume no liability for any damage, costs or inconvenience.\n</p> Advertisements <p> You can create bitcoin trade advertisements (\"advertisement\" or \"ad\" or \"ads\") to advertise that you want to buy or sell bitcoins.\nOther users can send trade requests to you from the advertisements that you\u2019ve created.\nWhen a trade request is sent to you a bitcoin trade is automatically started.\n</p>\n<p> Advertisements for buying with or selling against cash are not allowed.\n</p>\n<p> When you have advertisements enabled you are required to be active and available to reply to trades started from these advertisements.\nIf a dispute is initiated in a trade against an advertiser who is not active and available the advertiser may be deemed unresponsive within the meaning of this Agreement and the dispute may be resolved against them.\n</p>\n<p> Information and payment details you provide in advertisements and trades must at all times be correct and up to date.\nDisputes may be resolved against you if you include out-of-date payment details and a buyer completes payment accordingly.\nRefusal to complete trades or to provide payment details for trades opened from your advertisements is considered a violation of this agreement.\n</p>\n<p> The price or price equation that is defined in the advertisement details must contain any and all fees that the advertiser requires the buyer to pay.\nAfter initiation of a trade the price is locked and cannot be changed or any additional fees added without consent from both parties of the trade.\n</p>\n<p> Multiple advertisements which are fully overlapping (e.g.\nusing the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country) are not allowed.\n</p> Limitation, Suspension, and Termination of Your User Account <p> Occasionally situations arise where we may need to limit, suspend, or terminate your account.\nAccount limitation results in a temporary or permanent loss of access to a certain specific part or parts of the services we offer.\nAccount suspension results in a temporary loss of access to most parts of the services we offer.\nAccount termination results in permanent loss of access to all services.\n</p>\n<p> As a result of limitation, suspension or termination your access to and the withdrawal of bitcoins that you have in your LocalBitcoins wallet may be delayed or denied.\n</p>\n<p> We have the right to limit, suspend, or terminate your account or access to the services that we provide if: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>

protocols and that we are under no obligation to disclose the details of our risk management and security procedures to you unless otherwise provided by the Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> In the event that we limit, suspend or terminate your account we will lift the suspension as soon as possible once the reasons for the suspension or termination no longer exist.\n</p> Limiting Access to Your LocalBitcoins Wallet <p> In certain situations your ability to access, conduct bitcoin transactions, or start trades using bitcoin held in your LocalBitcoins wallet may be limited.\n</p>\n<p> This

We will give you a notice of any limitation of access to your wallet but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example we consider it advisable for security reasons), limit access to your wallet without prior notice.\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge that our decision to limit access to your wallet may be based on confidential criteria that are essential to our risk management and security protocols
