activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, and Customer ID history without a subpoena.\nWithout limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order, or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or report suspected illegal activity.\nIf Guest Reservations is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.\nWe may also disclose your personal

the room and the membership fee charged by Travel Agent, to your local currency and charge you a conversion fee.\nThis means that the amount listed on your credit or bank card statement may be in your

assessed if the bank that issued your credit or debit card is located outside of the United States.\nBooking international travel may be considered to be an international transaction by the bank or card company, since we may pass on your payment to an international travel supplier.\nIf you have any questions about these fees or the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your
