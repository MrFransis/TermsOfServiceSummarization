Account deletion </li>\n<li> Changes to this policy </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This document describes what information we collect and what it\u2019s used for.\nIt applies to all interactions with riseup.net.\nYour use of riseup.net services will constitute your agreement to our Privacy Policy.\nPlease also review our Terms of Service.</p> Summary <p>You have a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system.\nWe collect very little personal information, and none of the information we do collect is ever shared.</p> Information we collect and retain Registration information <p>When you create an account, we retain the date you registered (rounded to the nearest quarter year).\nAccount request information is removed after four months, and invite status is removed after one month.\nIf you choose to set a reset email address, we retain this record but in a format that is unreadable by us (it is stored in a hashed digest, similar to how passwords are stored).</p> Help tickets <p>The content of any help ticket you create or comment on while authenticated will be associated with your user account.\nYou can choose to fill out a help ticket anonymously by creating a ticket while not logged in.\nWe periodically delete old help tickets that are closed.</p> Session identifiers <p>While currently logged in, we keep a temporary session identifier on your computer that your software uses to prove your authentication state.\nThis is erased immediately after you log out or the session expires.\nWe do not use any third party cookies or tracking of any kind.</p> Email transit logs <p>In order to detect when our servers are under attack from a \u201cspam bomb\u201d or when a spammer is using our system, we keep a log of the \u201cfrom\u201d or \u201cto\u201d information for every message relayed.\nThese logs are purged on a daily basis.</p> Quarter of last log in <p>We keep a record of the quarter and year of your last successful authentication (in order to be able to disable and delete dormant accounts).\nWe do not record the time or day of the last log in.\nFor example, this information looks like \u201cQ3 2018\u201d.</p> Information we choose to not retain IP addresses <p>No IP addresses of any user for any service are retained.</p> Browser fingerprint <p>Your web browser communicates uniquely identifying information to all web servers it visits by allowing the site to know details about your operating system, browser information, plugins installed, fonts installed, screen resolution, and much more.\nWe do not retain any of this information.</p> Message metadata <p>Even when using end-to-end OpenPGP encryption for email messages, the email \u201csubject\u201d and routing information regarding the message \u201cfrom\u201d and \u201cto\u201d are seen by our servers in the clear when the email initially arrives.\nThis is due to inherent limitations in the email protocol and in OpenPGP.</p> How we store and share collected information Encryption <p>All of your data is stored in an encrypted format, and only Riseup has the keys to decrypt the data.\nAdditionally, as of March 2017, the storage for all new accounts is personally encrypted.\nRiseup is unable to read any of the stored content for these accounts.\nAny user with an account created prior to March 2017 may opt-in to personally encrypted storage.</p> We do not share user information <p>We retain only the bare minimum of information about each user that is required to make the service work.\nWe do not sell or share any of it.</p> Academic research <p>Anonymous, aggregated information that cannot be linked back to an individual user may be made available to experienced researchers for the sole purpose of developing better systems for anonymous and secure communication.\nFor example, we may aggregate information on how many messages a typical user sends and receives, and with what frequency.</p>\n<p>We will not read, search, or process any of your incoming or outgoing mail other than to protect you from viruses and spam or when directed to do so by you when troubleshooting.</p> Account deletion <p>You may choose to delete your riseup.net account at any time.\nDoing so will destroy all the data we retain that is associated with your account.\nThe usernames associated with deleted accounts remain unavailable for others to use for one year.</p> Changes to this policy <p>We reserve the right to change this policy.\nIf we make major changes, we will notify our users in a clear and prominent manner (like our Newsletters).\nMinor changes may only be highlighted in the footer of our website.</p> This site is run by Riseup, your friendly

This usually happens when they want logs, we tell them that we don\u2019t have any and then they come and take the machine because they don\u2019t believe us and want to see for themselves.\nHowever, all of our servers use full disk encryption, which means they cannot see or do anything with the data on the disks without the keys.\nNevertheless, we do not keep IP identifying logs, and store as little data as possible on our users.\nBut this is not just Riseup\u2019s responsibility, each user is responsible for limiting the amount of data that Riseup stores for them!</p> How can I limit the amount of data that Riseup stores for me? <p>There are several ways</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account info:</strong> When you applied for an account you provided a little information.\nAfter you are approved we don\u2019t need this information anymore and you can clean it up.\nLogin to user.riseup.net and review the information that you have provided there and consider what information you have given us that identifies you.\nFor example, if Obama had a secret email address with Riseup and applied for the address using president@whitehouse.gov as his alternate email address, it would be a good idea for him to remove president@whitehouse.gov from his alternate email if he wanted to be able to engage in Constitutionally-protected, anonymous, speech.</p>\n<p>But please note: If you do remove your alternate email, and you later lose/forget your password, it will <em>not be possible</em> for us to reset your password.\nYou will be permanently locked out of your account and will not be able to access your emails.\nYou have been warned!</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email:</strong> If you are not already, consider using an email client that lets you download email via the POP protocol and deletes it from the server.\nThere is no getting around the mail arriving on Riseup\u2019s server, but if you download it and it\u2019s deleted from the server then Riseup doesn\u2019t have it anymore.\nBut note this does have a downside, using webmail or the IMAP protocol does allow you to check email from more than one computer.\nIf you need that ability, one approach might be to move older email offline to a single computer and just check newer things from multiple locations.\nHere are some directions for downloading your email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lists:</strong> one of the nice features of having a mailing list is having a message archive.\nBut if the idea of someone you don\u2019t want getting access to that archive scares you, then it might be better to do without an archive or periodically move the archive to a more secure location.\nBut don\u2019t forget that any subscriber to your list gets a copy of every message, so even if you have the archives removed, there is nothing that prevents subscribers from leaking those messages! More info at: Downloading List Archives.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ask yourself:</strong> where are the important emails, documents, and manifestos of your group stored? Do you have a good place for them for people to find when you are gone and people want to write the history about how you changed the world? If they are only stored in Riseup, that isn\u2019t good.\nDownload them and put them somewhere safer! We are birds, so we like eggs, but we don\u2019t like people putting all their eggs in our basket.</p> Will Riseup services last forever? <p>While we are committed to doing everything in our power to protect the data of social movements and activists, short of extended incarceration, we would rather pull the plug than submit to repressive surveillance by any government.\nWe would be really sad to see Riseup go, but if we are forced to, we would rather it go away than to betray your trust and compromise the activist community.\nWith this in mind, you should be sure you are prepared in case something does happen, such as downloading and archive your email on your own computer!</p> What about child porn, drugs, corruption, etc.\nWould you fight law enforcement requests for users doing these things? <p>Those things violate Riseup\u2019s Terms of Service and, unlike some more \u201cAmerican Libertarian\u201d service providers, we do not exist to provide privacy for doing anything you want.\nWe would close the accounts of people doing those things and the collective may even decide to cooperate with law enforcement rather than set all the servers on fire and destroy the organization, and your email.</p> This site is run by Riseup, your friendly \u24b6utonomous tech collective since 1999 <ul>\n<li> Donate! </li>\n<li> About Us </li>\n<li> Privacy Policy </li>\n</ul> Please edit this site ", "created_at": "2018-08-29 04:19:46.494405", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:17:52.030839"}], "points": [{"id": 24605, "title": "The court of law governing the terms is in location the State of Washington, USA", "source": "https://riseup.net/en/about-us/policy/tos", "status": "Generated through the annotate view", "created_at": "2021-08-02 08:43:09.094499", "updated_at": "2021-10-02 22:15:08.890348", "quoteText": "Choice of Forum and Law <p>You agree that these Terms of Service and your use of riseup\u2019s services is governed by the law of the State of Washington and any claim or dispute shall be resolved in the Superior Court for King County, Washington.\n", "case_id": 163, "document_id": 429, "quoteStart": 3864, "quoteEnd": 4107}, {"id": 9012, "title": "The court of law governing the terms is in location X", "source": "https://riseup.net/en/about-us/policy/tos", "status": "Generated through the annotate view", "created_at": "2020-03-08 18:20:46.923286", "updated_at": "2021-07-30 22:05:07.007086", "quoteText": "Choice of Forum and Law <p>You agree that these Terms of Service and your use of riseup\u2019s services is governed by the law of the State of Washington and any claim or dispute shall be resolved in the Superior Court for King County, Washington", "case_id": 163, "document_id": 429, "quoteStart": 3864, "quoteEnd": 4105}, {"id": 1155, "title": "Minimal logging", "source": "https://riseup.net/privacy-policy", "status": "Riseup keeps no personally identifiable information in log files (for example, IP addresses or browser user agent strings).
