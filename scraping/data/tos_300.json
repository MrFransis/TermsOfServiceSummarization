place to get expert answers to your questions.\"</em> We decided early on that all user-generated content in the Stack Exchange Network would be given back to the community under a Creative Commons license.\nWe created the Stack Exchange API as a way to allow users to write applications which use the Stack Exchange Network in new and creative ways.\nWith open access to use (and reuse) our services, it is important that users not be confused by our relationship with the people who use our content and our services.</p> What this Document Covers <p>This document is designed to establish guidelines for use of our names (copyright) and logos (trademarks).\nThe \"names\" and \"logos\" discussed here refer collectively to <strong>any</strong>\n<strong>site or service</strong> on the Stack Exchange network and Stack Exchange Inc.\nThis document does not replace or waive any rights protected under Trademark or Copyright law.\nPlease note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you would like to use our trademark or name in ways <strong>not clearly covered</strong> by this document, please contact us.</li>\n<li>If you ever stumble across anything that looks like it violates our copyright, trademark, or policies, please let us know.</li>\n</ul> Trademark and Copyright <p>The logos associated with Stack Exchange Inc.\nand any Stack Exchange site are a trademark.\nThe purpose of trademark law is to prevent consumers from being misled as to the origin of a product.\nSo if you were making a product, and you used a Stack Exchange name or logo in your product (or in its advertising) in such a way that would mislead someone into thinking that your product was owned by, operated by, endorsed by, or in any way part of Stack Exchange Inc., you would be violating the trademark and this would not be legal.</p>\n<p>Our logo images and site names are copyrighted.\nAny content on the Stack Exchange Network <strong>not contributed by users</strong> is copyrighted.\nCopyright is different than trademark.\nOrdinarily you couldn't copy it.\nBut if you were writing a news story or blog post about a Stack Exchange site, reproducing the logo image would almost certainly be considered \"fair use\" and allowed under trademark law because you were not using it \"in trade.\"</p> Naming your Product, Application, Website, or Domain Name <p>We want you to create awesome products, applications, and web sites (collectively \"products\") using the Stack Exchange API .\nWe want people to recognize your product as an enhancement of the Stack Exchange ecosystem and use it with enthusiasm.\nBut Stack Exchange is the name of our company and services, so we have to be cautious about any confusion that may cause.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Do name your application with something unique.\nIncluding <strong>one</strong> of the terms, \"Stack\" or \"Exchange\" or \"Overflow\" in your product name is generally okay.</li>\n<li> Do feel free to explain that your product is built on the Stack Exchange platform so people understand your product.</li>\n<li> Do not use our name in the name of your product.</li>\n<li> Do not register or use a domain name containing our name (or misspellings of our name).\n</li>\n<li> Do not apply for a trademark with a name that includes our own.</li>\n</ul> Design of Your Product <ul>\n<li> Do design your product with unique branding and logos.</li>\n<li> Do feel free&nbsp.\nto use names or logos for the purpose of labeling our sites within your product, as long as use of such logos could not be confused with the branding or endorsement of the product itself.</li>\n<li> Do not copy the look and feel of our products.</li>\n<li> Do not include elements of our network that are not user-contributed content (i.e.\nno copyright material).</li>\n<li> Do not use our name, logo, or service to promote or allow fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activities.</li>\n</ul> Use of Our Name or Logo in Advertising <ul>\n<li> Do use the most current logo where applicable and permitted.</li>\n<li> Do use the proper name for our company, product, or service (see \"Proper Use of the Stack Exchange Name\" below).</li>\n<li> Do not use our logo unless you have been granted special permission by Stack Exchange Inc.</li>\n<li> Do not use our name or logo in a way that might imply a false sense of partnership or endorsement with your product.</li>\n<li> Do not use any name or logo that is similar to or might be confused with our name or logo.</li>\n<li> Do not distort or alter our logo in any way.</li>\n<li> Do not use our logo in a way that confuses our brand with another brand.</li>\n<li> Do not use any other artwork from our network without explicit permission.</li>\n</ul> Promoting your own Account <ul>\n<li> Do feel free to use your profile \"Flair\" to reference or link to your user account.\nUse of unaltered logos in the context of displaying the entire content of User Flair is generally okay.</li>\n<li> Do use the same guidelines as \"Advertising\" when promoting your own account.</li>\n<li> Do not manipulate the logos or imply sponsorship, endorsement, or false information related to your association or account on Stack Exchange.</li>\n</ul> Writing a Book About Stack Exchange <ul>\n<li> Do make sure the title of your book makes clear that it\u2019s a book <em>about</em> Stack Exchange, and not <em>by</em> Stack Exchange.\nFor example, \u201cLearning how to use Stack Exchange\u201d is appropriate, whereas \u201cThe Stack Exchange Guide to Q&amp;A\" is not.</li>\n<li> Do not use a confusing book title which might imply your book is endorsed or written by us.</li>\n<li> Do not use our logo on your cover or in your title.</li>\n<li> Do not use our name, logo, or service to promote or allow fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activities.</li>\n</ul> Merchandise/Manufactured Items <p>We generally do not permit use of our name or logo on merchandise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Do contact Stack Exchange Inc.\nwith a detailed proposal if you would like to request an exception.</li>\n<li> Do not use the names or logos owned by Stack Exchange Inc.\non any apparel or merchandise without our permission.</li>\n</ul> Proper Use of the Stack Exchange Name <p>There is some confusion around the proper use and context of the Stack Exchange name.\nHere are some guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Stack Exchange Inc.</strong> is the official name of the company.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stack Overflow</strong> is a programmer Q&amp;A site on the Stack Exchange Network.\nAs a name, Stack Overflow, is always written \"Stack Overflow\" (two words, capital letters).&nbsp;The website domain name is always written <strong>stackoverflow.com</strong> (no CamelCase, single word capitalization rules apply).\nCurrently, all Stack Exchange Network sites follow this convention: Server Fault (serverfault.com), Super User (superuser.com), etc.</li>\n<li>A <strong>Stack Exchange site</strong> is a Q&amp;A website built on the technology of Stack Exchange Inc.\nThe phrase \"Stack Exchange\" is generally used as an adjective, not a noun.\nOne would say \"Propose a Stack Exchange site on Area 51\" (correct), not \"Propose a Stack Exchange on Area 51\" (wrong).</li>\n<li>The <strong>Stack Exchange Network</strong> refers to the collection of Stack Exchange sites and services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Area 51</strong> (two words) is the site used to propose new Stack Exchange sites for the Stack Exchange Network.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Stack Exchange API </strong>allows users to write applications based on the Stack Exchange engine.\nThe API is always referred to as \"Stack Exchange API\", even if the application is written for a specific site (i.e.\nnever Stack Overflow API, Server Fault API, etc.).</li>\n<li>\n<strong> The Overflow</strong> is the company blog which talks about everything we're doing on all our sites and what the company itself is doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>The Stack Exchange name and logos are trademarks of Stack Exchange Inc.\nThe names and logos for sites and products operating on the Stack Exchange network are also trademarks of Stack Exchange Inc.</em>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2018-07-17 10:11:44.444992", "updated_at": "2021-06-26 01:59:09.85607"}, {"id": 98, "name": "Content Policy", "url":

acceptable use of any website or service provided on the Stack Exchange Network (collectively \"Stack Exchange\", \"Network\").</p>\n<p>If you are found to be in violation of any of the below policies, you will receive a notice via email.\nUnless you explain or correct your behavior within 72 hours, your account will be suspended.\nWe will do our best to work with you and ensure a fair outcome in all cases.\nWe reserve the right to immediately suspend, without notice, any content, account, or IP address which we determine to be submitting spam or other potentially damaging or disruptive content to the Network.</p>\n<p>When your account is suspended, public access to content contributed under that account may be blocked or removed, and your account may be suspended or deleted at our discretion.\nAccess to other functionality or information within the Network may also be blocked or disabled.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Illegal Use.</b> Stack Exchange may not be used for illegal purposes.\nExamples of this include using Stack Exchange for fraudulent purposes or operating a phishing site (used to obtain account and password information).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Spam.</b> Users that do not publish meaningful content, use deceptive means to generate revenue or traffic, or whose primary purpose is affiliate marketing, will be suspended.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Identity Theft and Privacy.</b> Users that misleadingly appropriate the identity of another person are not permitted.\nUsers may not post other people's personally identifying or confidential information, including but not limited to credit card numbers, Social Security Numbers, and driver's and other license numbers.\nYou may not post information such as other people's passwords, usernames, phone numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses unless already publicly accessible on the Web.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Hate Content, Defamation, and Libel.</b> Hate speech and other objectionable content that is unlawful, defamatory, and fraudulent.\nNote that an allegation of defamatory expression, in and of itself, does not establish defamation.\nThe truth or falsehood of a bit of expression is a key element in establishing defamation, and we are not in a position to make that sort of fact-based judgment.\nThat said, if we have reason to believe that a particular statement is defamatory (a court order, for example), we will remove that statement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Disruptions and Exploits.</b> We will terminate accounts and block addresses of those who attempt unauthorized use of the Stack Exchange Network.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Copyright.</b> Using copyrighted material does not constitute infringement in all cases.\nIn general, however, users should be careful when using copyrighted content without the permission of those who created it.\nIt is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement sent to legal@stackoverflow.com that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\").</p>\n<p>\n<b>Mass Registration and Automation.</b> Accounts that are registered automatically or systematically will be removed and access will be permanently suspended.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sexually Explicit Material.</b> Accounts that use Stack Exchange to post sexually explicit or pornographic material, or links to it, will be suspended.</p> Stack Overflow

information we collect about you from the various sources described above.\n</p>\n<p> WHY WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION (PURPOSES) </p>\n<p> This section explains why we collect your information and what we need it for (purposes).\nThis is set out below, by reference to what the information is required for.\n</p>\n<p> We collect and process your personal information in order to offer the Network,

to register you for certain account services.\n</p>\n<p> Account registration information </p>\n<p> We need to collect your personal information for account registration purposes.\nAlthough the Network provides for anonymous and pseudonymous participation, in some instances in order to use certain Products or Services, we require account registration.\nThis requires a name associated with your account, an email address at which we can contact you, and in some cases, additional information including, a contact address, a billing address, and a password to help secure your personal information.\n</p>\n<p> Profile information </p>\n<p> When completing a public \u201cprofile\u201d, whether it is for use with the Network or our Products and Services, we may require you to share

Stack Overflow Network, and certain of our Products and Services, we collect location information about you including your IP address, your location, browser information, and how you came to the Stack Overflow Network.\nThis is the case for individuals who have registered for an account, and non-members who engage with the Stack Overflow Network by visiting our website(s) but who have not completed an account registration.\n</p>\n<p> This information is collected for various purposes, including advertising, analytics and to serve content as it relates to certain Products or Services (e.g., Talent), as well as to provide you with localized content, recommendations, and marketing.\nYou may revoke our permission to collect some of this data, including your location and browser information through your Account Settings, but this may limit functionality in some cases.\nCertain location information we collect is required for security and site functionality.\nWe share this information with certain third-parties (e.g., talent recruiters, payment processors, and advertising providers) in order to provide you with our Products and Services.\n</p>\n<p> WHO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH

our Products and Services.\nWe may on occasion share this information with third parties for research or product and services optimization.\n</p>\n<p> Billing information </p>\n<p> For Products and Services requiring payment, we collect a billing name, phone number, and email address.\nWe also collect a billing and shipping address for invoicing purposes.\nIf you elect to pay by credit card, Stack Overflow may engage a third party to securely process your payment.\nAll payment processing is done through a PCI DSS compliant third party.\nIf customers are paying by a credit card, their card details are vaulted through a third-party payment gateway.\nStack Overflow will store an encrypted token along with the last four digits of the credit card and the expiration month and year of the card and will not store or retain any other billing information about you.\n</p>\n<p> Developer Survey </p>\n<p> As the world\u2019s largest developer community, Stack Overflow publishes an annual Developer Survey to provide key insights into the developer community, as well as other surveys from time to time, all of which include demographic (e.g.\ngender, race, age etc) and certain personal information.\nYour participation in the Developer Survey as well as any other Stack Overflow survey is entirely voluntary.\nIn order to provide meaningful insights into the developer community, Stack Overflow may collect sensitive data about you, including, but not limited to your gender, race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and your location.\nWe consider this data to be among our most sensitive, and have taken elevated measures to protect such data as well as to de-identify your name and other personal information from such data.\nWe restrict such data within Stack Overflow on a privileged basis to only those that need to see it and while we may share your personal information with certain third parties such as researchers, we do so only after imposing contractual obligations of confidentiality on such third parties and only where absolutely necessary for limited research purposes.\n</p>\n<p> When we publish our surveys, they are published as a compilation of anonymized data, which means that we take every effort to ensure that your information is understood in a statistical narrative decoupled from your personal identity.\n</p>\n<p> If you have any questions concerning the Developer Survey or other survey and our security measures to protect your sensitive personal data, please contact us at: privacy@stackoverflow.com.\n</p>\n<p> Legal basis for processing your information </p>\n<p> We will only use your information where we have a legal basis for using it, for example, where we have your consent, or where we need to carry out processing to provide you with a service you have requested.\nThis section describes the legal bases we rely on for processing your information, including when we share it with third parties.\n</p>\n<p> When you access the Stack Overflow Network and use the Products and Services we offer, we collect, display, store, share, transmit, and process your information in the manner described in this policy.\n</p>\n<p> In order to carry out these activities, Stack Overflow may rely on the following legal bases in order to process your personal data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Where you have given us consent to process the information, which you can withdraw at any time.\n</li>\n<li> Where the processing is necessary: <ul>\n<li> to carry out the contractual obligations in the Terms of Service or to provide the Products and Services you have requested </li>\n<li> to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims </li>\n<li> to protect the public interest or vital interest of others </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Where it is in our legitimate interests, or that of a third party to carry out the processing.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Whenever we rely on legitimate interests for processing, we ensure that we consider and balance our interests against the individual\u2019s interests before processing.\nWe do not use your personal data on the basis of legitimate interest for activities where individuals\u2019 interests override our interests.\n</p>\n<p> Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do so in order to: </p>\n<p> Secure your personal data and information </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow is committed to the safety and security of your personal data and the information that you share with us and with the public.\nWe treat your personal data and safety from harassment as top organizational priorities.\nAt Stack Overflow we consider it necessary to pursue these legitimate interests in order to keep our community, you and your information safe from spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, identity theft, and the scraping and unlawful collection of your information.\n</p>\n<p> Provide and optimize products and services </p>\n<p> We use your information to provide and improve our Products and Services, for identification, verification, to provide support, for online and offline marketing including through third party tools such as Google Analytics, and for general research and analytics reporting.\nIn doing so, we may learn which of our Products and Services you are using most, what you\u2019re interested in, and to better enable you to use and access our Products and Services.\nAs a core part of our business, Stack Overflow has a legitimate interest in enabling and customizing your experience of our Product and Services offerings.\n</p>\n<p> Engage in commercial transactions </p>\n<p> As part of providing our core Products and Services, Stack Overflow may charge you for the use of some Products and Services, or certain features within these Products and Services.\nIn order to process your payment, and to secure your financial information, we may facilitate the sharing of your information with third parties.\nWe share your information only with third parties who have met strict security standards and consider the secure processing of your financial information to be a strict and legitimate business necessity.\n</p>\n<p> Comply with regulatory and legal obligations </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow has a legitimate interest in complying with certain legal obligations and interests which, from time to time, may require the disclosure of your personal information.\nStack Overflow will not disclose your personal information to legal authorities except where such disclosure is by lawful request, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement demands (including a subpoena, court order, or other lawful legal demand by a legal authority with lawful jurisdiction).\nIn some cases, we may also release your personal information to defend our legitimate legal interests.\nWe consider our obligation to protect the Stack Overflow community from imminent physical harm to be both a legitimate business interest as well as to be within the public interest and may disclose your personal information if we believe you or another individual may be in imminent danger of harm to yourself or to another.\n</p>\n<p> Marketing and product communications </p>\n<p> From time to time, Stack Overflow may communicate with you about commercial and other Product and Services offerings.\nIn doing so, we provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such messages at any time you choose via your account settings.\nStack Overflow will not sell your personal information to enhance our marketing opportunities or profitability (except as may relate to a corporate event such as a sale or merger), and as we are committed to preventing spam, our direct marketing efforts are limited in scope and frequency.\nWe engage in such activities as a legitimate business interest in order to promote key Products and Service offerings and provide you with every opportunity to unsubscribe from such communications or to further limit their scope and frequency.\nIn short, while we want to communicate some key commercial communications with you and have determined it to be a legitimate interest for us to be able to do so, you have the final say in whether or not you would like to receive such commercial communications from us.\nYou can review or change your permissions in your Profile Settings.\n</p>\n<p> Core business operations </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow may engage with third parties in business transactions including the buying and selling of assets, the auditing of our business practices and financials, and to engage in business development opportunities.\nThese core activities may involve the processing and/or disclosure of some limited personal information which may be necessary and within our legitimate interests to develop the Stack Overflow brand and business.\nIf we transfer any personal information in pursuing such a business transaction, we will always ensure that strict confidentiality measures are in place to protect your privacy interests.\n</p>\n<p> YOUR CHOICE AND CONTROL OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON YOU </p>\n<p> Privacy is a guiding principle of all Stack Overflow Products and Services and we value your privacy.\nTo this end, we provide you with the ability to control how your information is stored, and what information is collected.\nYou may change or correct your account settings and choose not to share certain information by creating a pseudonymous account.\nAdditionally, much of the data we collect is voluntary and your choice entirely to provide us or not.\nYou may also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly displayed, such as your photo, or job history.\nIn the event Stack Overflow decides to provide additional opt-out or opt-in mechanisms under the Privacy Shield Framework, the mechanisms will be clear, conspicuous, and readily available for you to exercise your choice.\nAnd of course, should you wish, you may also request the permanent deletion of your account, in which case all personal information collected on you will be removed from our servers and encrypted (except, in some cases your IP address required for security purposes, site maintenance, and spam protection).\n</p>\n<p> We also provide you additional data control options created by the GDPR, but provided to the Stack Overflow community regardless of geographic location with respect to your information, including data access and portability (including the right to obtain and download a copy of the personal data you provided to Stack Overflow), data correction (the ability to update the personal data we collect and display on you, in many cases via your account settings), data deletion (where Stack Overflow will delete personal information stored on you, which we are not required by necessity to maintain), and the ability to have us stop processing your personal data (with certain exceptions as may be necessary).\nYou may submit data requests to privacy@stackoverflow.com.\n</p>\n<p> Please also be aware that in order to respond to data requests and provide data choices to you, we may need to first verify your identity.\n</p>\n<p> You may additionally control the receipt of certain marketing and advertising communications from Stack Overflow.\nSome messages that we send are required, and related to our legal obligations, or service related and mandatory.\nOther messages, like marketing and advertising communications are provided by us to let you know how you can continue to share, learn, and build your knowledge within the Stack Overflow community, and are voluntary.\nWe provide you with the opportunity to control which voluntary (non-mandatory/required) messages you would like to receive in your Profile Settings.\n</p>\n<p> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON YOU WHEN YOU USE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS </p>\n<p> When you register for our services or if you or your organization set up a Private Network, we may collect some additional information in connection with that service or product.\nThis section describes in further detail the information we collect on you and how we use that information broken down by our Products and Services offerings.\n</p>\n<p> Click below for links to the Privacy Notices for each of our Products and Service

consent, which can be withdrawn at any time, or if we have a legitimate interest.\n</p>\n<p> WHERE WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION (LOCATION) </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow will process your information through, or on behalf of its entities located in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the EEA.\nWe may transfer your information to companies working on our behalf and to other third parties and agents located outside the European Economic Area.\n</p>\n<p> Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries outside the EEA, including the rights of authorities to

INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow is a global community and as such, you may access the Stack Overflow Network from almost anywhere in the world.\nWhen you do this, you will also be subject to the local laws of your jurisdiction you are accessing it from.\nBy accessing the Stack Overflow Network and engaging with our Products and Services, you acknowledge that your personal data may be collected and transferred from your local jurisdiction (including member states to the European Union) to the United States.\n</p>\n<p> Where Stack Overflow transfers your personal data from your local jurisdiction (including member states to the European Union) we rely on certain lawful transfer mechanisms to do so, including the following lawful bases for such transfers: </p>\n<p> Privacy shield </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow complies with the EU - US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss - US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.\nStack Overflow has certified (note: certification under legal name Stack Exchange, Inc.) to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles including onward transfer principles as amended by the GDPR where applicable.\nStack Overflow acknowledges accountability under the onward transfer principles of the Privacy Shield Framework when transferring data to third parties.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.\nStack Exchange, Inc.\nis subject to the investigative and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.\nUnder certain circumstances, you may invoke binding arbitration to determine, for residual claims, whether Stack Overflow has violated its Privacy Shield obligations, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied.\nStack Overflow has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the PrivacyTrust Shield Program, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United Kingdom.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint from Stack Overflow, or if we have not addressed your concern to your satisfaction, please contact us: privacy@stackoverflow.com or visit https://privacytrust.com/drs/stackexchange or at the contact information provided below.\n</p>\n<p> Standard contractual clauses </p>\n<p> The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also referred to as model clauses), which provide safeguards to protect the transfer of personal information outside of the European Union.\nWe may use these standard contractual clauses when transferring personal information outside of the European Union.\nYou may review and request a copy of such standard contractual clauses as used by Stack Overflow by contacting us at legal@stackoverflow.com.\n</p>\n<p> OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY </p>\n<p> Security is important to us and we know it is important to you.\nStack Overflow follows generally accepted standards to protect your personal information when processing, transferring, and storing your personal information including Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d), by restricting your personal data when we do not need to access it and by keeping your personal data only as necessary to perform our legitimate business interests.\n</p>\n<p> As the data subject, you too have an important role to play in helping us protect your personal information.\nWe encourage you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your personal information by choosing a password carefully and in accordance with industry best standards.\nDo not share your password with anyone you do not trust, and make sure your computer accesses Stack Overflow via a secure network and that you do not leave your personal information vulnerable to hackers and other bad actors by leaving your computer unattended or by failing to logout of your account when you have ended your session activity.\n</p>\n<p>

\u201cNetwork\u201d), owned and operated by Stack Exchange, Inc.\n(\u201cStack Overflow\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), a Delaware corporation.\nStack Overflow welcomes you to the Network, the largest community of developers in the world, and invites you to participate in the community by sharing knowledge with your peers and colleagues.\nLike all communities, we ask that you participate in a manner that respects your fellow community members.\nTo that end, we provide you with these terms of service to advise you of the legal obligations you assume when you engage with the Stack Overflow community or otherwise access or use the public Network or any services provided on the public Network (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d).\nThese terms govern the use of the public Network (the \u201cPublic Network Terms\u201d).</p>\n<p>To the extent you are accessing or using our other products on behalf of a Company or Team, including without limitation by registering for an account on behalf of a Company or Team, your use of those products (such as Stack Overflow for Teams or Stack Overflow Business) is governed by their relevant Terms and Conditions.</p> 1.\nPublic Network Terms <p>Please read these Public Network Terms carefully before accessing or using the public Network.\nThese Public Network Terms constitute an agreement between Stack Overflow and you and governs your permitted use of the public Network ONLY, including any Services or Products that are part of the public Network.\nBy accessing or using the Services or the public Network in any manner, including without limitation by visiting or browsing the public Network or registering for an account on the Network, you affirm that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Public Network Terms, as well as the Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy.\nStack Overflow reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Public Network Terms at any time by posting revised Public Network Terms on the public Network and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the public Network.\nYou shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.\nYour access to or use of the Services or public Network following such modification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Public Network Terms as modified.\nTo reiterate, and for clarity, these Public Network Terms apply to all who access or use the Services or public Network, including without limitation users who contribute content, information, and other materials or services, registered or otherwise.</p>\n<p>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT BY USING THE PUBLIC NETWORK, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cMANDATORY ARBITRATION\u201d BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p> 2.\nContracts are Binding and Legally Enforceable -- Please Read! <p>As stated above, these Public Network Terms constitute an agreement between Stack Overflow and you and governs your use of the public Network.\nThese Public Network Terms do NOT govern the use of our Talent, Enterprise and other Stack Overflow products and services that are not part of the public Network.\nIn the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of these Public Network Terms and any such service or licensing agreements, the terms and conditions of the Public Network Terms shall prevail.</p> 3.\nAge Eligibility <p>You must be at least 13 years old to access or use the Network or Services, including without limitation to complete a Stack Overflow account registration.\nBy accessing or using the Services or the Network in any manner, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age.\nIf you are under 13 years old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, access or use the Services or Network in any manner, and may not provide any personal information to or on the Services or Network (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).</p>\n<p>If you are located within the European Union, you must be at least 16 years old to access or use the Network or Services, including without limitation to complete a Stack Overflow Account Registration.\nBy accessing or using the Services or the Network in any manner, you represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years of age.\nIf you are under 16 years old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, access or use the Services or Network in any manner, and may not provide any personal information to or on the Services or Network (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).</p> 4.\nAccess to the Public Network <p>Any user of the public Network is welcome to participate in community discussions, to answer questions, and to share their hard earned knowledge with public Network community participants, provided that they comply with the obligations set forth in these Public Network Terms, and to the extent that use of the public Network does not conflict with the applicable laws, rules and regulations of the user\u2019s jurisdiction.\nStack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have in any way violated these Public Network Terms or are otherwise ineligible to access or use the Network or Services.\nIf your actions are determined by us to violate these Public Network Terms, Stack Overflow may, in its sole discretion, try to remediate that violation by working with you individually, but is under no obligation to do so, and if any such remediation efforts are unsuccessful (in Stack Overflow\u2019s sole discretion), then Stack Overflow may revoke your rights to the Network.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that these Public Network Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, and the right to access the Network or any Services is revoked where these Public Network Terms or use of the Network or any Services is prohibited or conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>\n<p>Stack Overflow will use reasonable efforts to make the public Network available 24/7/365, but from time-to-time we will have scheduled outages for maintenance purposes and other upkeep.\nWhere feasible, we may, in our sole discretion, make efforts to inform you about any outages and report on the nature and reason for any outages that may occur in an open and transparent manner, though we are under no obligation to do so, and in any case will not be liable for any downtime.</p> 5.\nUser Obligations <ul>\n<li>To access some of the public Network features you will need to register for an account as an individual and consent to these Public Network Terms.\nIf you do not consent to these Public Network Terms, Stack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network.</li>\n<li>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your account registration is complete and remains up to date.\nYou have the right to discontinue use of, or terminate, your account whenever you like, and subject to our Privacy Policy, control the use and sharing of your account information.\nPlease note that any content or information you share publicly is governed by the terms described below in the section titled \u201cContent Permissions, Restrictions, and Creative Commons Licensing,\u201d and you should be aware that once you place content in the public sphere, you willingly give up some rights and control over such content.</li>\n<li>Stack Overflow strongly encourages you to review our Privacy Policy, which explains how we will handle, process, and use your personal data, and with whom, and how we will share this data.</li>\n<li>Stack Overflow is a community and we expect you to treat each member of the Stack Overflow community with respect.\nWhether a community member is asking their first question, or is a reputation superstar, we respect you and welcome you, but we also require you to be kind to one another.\nTo prevent bad actors from creating a negative community experience, we have outlined what we believe to be common sense rules for community participation and reserve the right to pause or terminate your account if you engage in disruptive, abusive, or nefarious behavior outside of Stack Overflow\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Public Network Terms.</li>\n<li>You are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to or access the Network or otherwise use the Services, including without limitation modems, hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services and Network.</li>\n<li>Some premium or additional features of Stack Overflow (including without limitation Stack Overflow for Teams) may require a payment obligation for access and use.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that your payment obligations, if any, remain current and not in arrears.\nIn the event Stack Overflow charges for features you will be clearly notified of the terms of any payment obligations and provided the opportunity to refuse such obligations before you incur any charges.\nPlease note, however, that your refusal to accept payment obligations may result in your inability to access or use certain premium or additional features of Stack Overflow.</li>\n</ul> 6.\nContent Permissions, Restrictions, and Creative Commons Licensing Stack Overflow Content <p>All materials displayed or performed on the public Network, including but not limited to text, graphics, logos, tools, photographs, images, illustrations, software or source code, audio and video, and animations (collectively \u201cNetwork

Network Content accessed through the Services.</p>\n<p>The Network is protected by copyright as a collective work and/or compilation, pursuant to U.S.\ncopyright laws, international covenants, and other copyright laws.\nOther than as expressly set forth in these Public Network Terms, you may not copy, modify, publish, transmit, upload, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided in this Agreement), create derivative works based on, distribute, perform, display, or in any way exploit any of the Network Content, software, materials, or Services in whole or in part.\nYou may download or copy the public Network Content, and other items displayed on the public Network for download or personal use provided that you maintain all copyright and other notices contained in such Public Content.</p>\n<p>From time to time, Stack Overflow may make available compilations of all the Subscriber Content on the public Network (the \u201cCreative Commons Data Dump\u201d).\nThe Creative Commons Data Dump is licensed under the CC BY-SA license.\nBy downloading the Creative Commons Data Dump, you agree to be bound by the terms of that license.</p>\n<p>Any other downloading, copying, or storing of any public Network Content (other than Subscriber Content or content made available via the Stack Overflow API) for other than personal, noncommercial use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from Stack Overflow or from the copyright holder identified in the copyright notice per the Creative Commons License.\nIn the event you download software from the public Network (other than Subscriber Content or content made available by the Stack Overflow API) the software including any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, the data accompanying the software (collectively, the \u201cSoftware\u201d) is licensed to you by Stack Overflow or third party licensors for your personal, noncommercial use, and no title to the Software shall transfer to you.\nStack Overflow or third party licensors retain full and complete title to the Software and all intellectual property rights therein.</p> Subscriber Content <p>You agree that any and all content, including without limitation any and all text, graphics, logos, tools, photographs, images, illustrations, software or source code, audio and video, animations, and product feedback (collectively, \u201cContent\u201d) that you provide to the public Network (collectively, \u201cSubscriber Content\u201d), is perpetually and irrevocably licensed to Stack Overflow on a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive basis pursuant to Creative Commons licensing terms (CC BY-SA 4.0), and you grant Stack Overflow the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to access, use, process, copy, distribute, export, display and to commercially exploit such Subscriber Content, even if such Subscriber Content has been contributed and subsequently removed by you as reasonably necessary to, for example (without limitation):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide, maintain, and update the public Network</li>\n<li>Process lawful requests from law enforcement agencies and government agencies</li>\n<li>Prevent and address security incidents and data security features, support features, and to provide technical assistance as it may be required</li>\n<li>Aggregate data to provide product optimization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that you cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to publish, distribute, store and use such content and to allow others to have derivative rights to publish, distribute, store and use such content.\nThe CC BY-SA 4.0 license terms are explained in further detail by Creative Commons, and the license terms applicable to content are explained in further detail here.\nYou should be aware that all Public Content you contribute is available for public copy and redistribution, and all such Public Content must have appropriate attribution.</p>\n<p>As stated above, by agreeing to these Public Network Terms you also agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Acceptable Use Policy incorporated herein, and hereby acknowledge and agree that any and all Public Content you provide to the public Network is governed by the Acceptable Use Policy.</p> 7.\nDisclaimer of Warranties <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, STACK OVERFLOW DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND

SERVICES, AND ANY RELATED CONTENT OR PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO THESE PUBLIC NETWORK TERMS ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d BASIS.</p> 8.\nIndemnification <p>You will indemnify and hold Stack Overflow, its directors,
