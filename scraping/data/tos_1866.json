relating to an identified or identifiable <em>natural</em> person</li>\n<li>\u2018processing\u2019 means any operation [\u2026] on personal data [\u2026] such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we talk about your personal data in the following, we mean anything that can be used to identify you.\nExamples are your name, e-mail address, and IP address.\nWhen we talk about \u201cprocessing of personal data,\u201d we mean any type of processing.</p>Personal data we process<p>When you visit our website, your <strong>IP address</strong> and user-agent are automatically processed by our web server.\nWe automatically get this data from your client (e.g., your web browser or RSS/Atom feed reader).\nOur web server needs your IP address to send our contents back to your client.\nBy default, we do not process any other personal data from you.\nFurthermore, our web server doesn\u2019t store your IP address permanently (e.g., in log files).</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data, as explained above, is Article 6(1) f GDPR.\nOur legitimate interest is providing our content.</p>Logging<p>Our web server writes information about particular client-side requests to so-called log files.\nWe use these log files to detect attack-like behavior and to improve our services.\nOur web server automatically encrypts all log files after one day using public-key cryptography.\nThe encrypted log files are automatically deleted after ten days.</p>\n<p>In case of abnormal requests (for technical people: all HTTP status codes except 200, 302, 304), we only log the following.\nUnusual requests include repeated attempts to access denied files or other attack-like behavior:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>timestamp (\"[31/Dec/2016:12:01:10 +0100]\")</li>\n<li>IP address (\u201c123.123.123.123\u201d)</li>\n<li>HTTP status code (\u201c403\u201d)</li>\n<li>bytes transmitted (\u201c157\u201d)</li>\n<li>first line of request for each

application firewall also logs full client-side requests and full server-side responses</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use this data to identify new attacks, audit blocked requests, and unblock legitimate users, if necessary.\nWe store blocked IP addresses for 14 days.\nWe also use this data to identify broken links (for technical people: HTTP status code 404).</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data, as explained in this section, is Article 6(1) f GDPR.\nOur legitimate interests are blocking attacks and improving our services.</p>Personal data third parties process for us<p>The following third parties process personal data for us:</p>netcup GmbH, Germany<p>The netcup GmbH (read their privacy policy) provides our servers.\nThe netcup GmbH may log access attempts (IP address, user-agent) for all of its customers (including us) to detect DDoS attacks, attack-like behavior, and so on.</p>\n<p>We concluded a data processing agreement according to Article 28 GDPR with netcup GmbH.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is Article 6(1) f GDPR.\nOur legitimate interest and the interest of the netcup GmbH is detecting/blocking attack-like behavior and proving our content.</p>Tutao GmbH, Germany (e-mail only)<p>The Tutao GmbH (read their privacy policy) provides our mail server.\nIt isn\u2019t necessary to send us any e-mails to access our website.\n<strong>If you decide to contact us, you agree that Tutao GmbH and we process your personal data (e.g., name, e-mail address) to answer your request.</strong> We do not use your e-mail address for marketing purposes or tracking.\nWe immediately delete your e-mails after your request is answered.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is Article 6(1) a GDPR.\nYou may withdraw your consent with this at any time.</p>Accessing our website using mirrors and archives<p>Third parties may provide our content as a mirror (reflecting the current content) or as an archived website (reflecting outdated content).\nKindly note that this privacy policy doesn\u2019t cover such mirrors or archives.</p>Your rights (Articles 15\u201320 GDPR)<p>According to Articles 15 to 20 of the GDPR, you have several rights concerning your personal data processed by us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Art.\n15: Right of access</li>\n<li>Art.\n16: Right to rectification</li>\n<li>Art.\n17: Right to erasure</li>\n<li>Art.\n18: Right to restriction of processing</li>\n<li>Art.\n19: Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing</li>\n<li>Art.\n20: Right to data portability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may exercise your rights by contacting us.</p>Right to object (Article 21 GDPR)<p>\n<strong>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point e or f of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions.\nWe no longer process the personal data unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of you or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nThis doesn\u2019t affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal (point c of Article 13(2) GDPR).</strong>\n</p>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article 77 GDPR)<p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
