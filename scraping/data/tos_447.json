is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material.\nand</li>\n<li>\n<strong>(c)</strong> terminate such content provider\u2019s access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.</em> If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner\u2019s agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>(a)</strong> A physical or electronic

mistake or misidentification of the material.\nand</li>\n<li>\n<strong>(d)</strong> Content provider\u2019s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider\u2019s address is located, or, if the content provider\u2019s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.\nUnless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company\u2019s discretion.\n[<strong>NOTE</strong>: <em>This counter notice and content replacement process in this policy is left to the Company\u2019s discretion so that the Company is not promising to provide the counter-notice or to restore the content.\nThe language in the DMCA that protects the Company against liability to the content poster is not discretionary.\nhowever (a) the Company is

makes even if it has already requested or received payment.<br>\nIf the Payment Processor identifies or we otherwise believe that your transaction may pose an unacceptable level of risk, that you have breached these Terms, or that your account has been compromised, we may take various actions to avoid liability and reduce potential fraud and disputes.\nThe actions we may take (and we expressly reserve the right to take) include, but are not limited to, suspending or limiting your ability to purchase any Paid Services, refusing or rejecting your transaction, or blocking you from accessing or using some or part of the Services (especially for users with a record of fraudulent transactions, requesting refunds on multiple occasions without valid reasons, having caused chargebacks, or otherwise posing high risks).\nIf possible, we will provide you with advance notice of our actions and resolution steps.\nHowever, advance notice will not be provided if there is an immediate need to take actions such as a security threat, potential fraud, or illegal activity.<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Payment Method</b>.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Current Information Required</b>.\nYou must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account.\n&nbsp;You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date) through your BlueStacks account, and you must promptly notify us or our payment processor if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password.\n&nbsp;Changes to such information can be made through your BlueStacks account.\nIf you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of Paid Services under your billing account unless you have terminated your Paid Services by means of sending us an email to premium dot support at bluestacks dot com.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Change in Amount Authorized</b>.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Reaffirmation of Authorization</b>.\nYour non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.\nWe may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.\nYour charges may be payable in advance or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Subscription
