single-pixel image.\nIt can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information.\nFor example, it allows an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.</p>\n<p>Third-party online tracking and behavioral advertising.\nWe also may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use some of the personal and non-personal information described in this section.\nFor example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on the Site or in email communications from Simply Earth.\nThis information may be used for a variety of purposes, including online behavioral advertising, as discussed below (see the section entitled \"How we share personal and non-personal information with third parties\").</p>\n<p>How we use the personal and non-personal information that we collect\nSimply Earth uses the information that we collect for a variety of purposes.\nIf we have personal information

confirmations, account information, notifications, awards, service-related announcements, and similar operational communications.\nto improve or personalize your user experience.\nto improve the quality of our products and services.\nto comply with legal and/or regulatory requirements.\nand to manage our business.</p>\n<p>We use the non-personal information that we collect for such purposes

including emails or postal mail about the products and services offered by Simply Earth or our partners.\nAlthough we hope you will find our promotional emails of interest, you may opt out of

personal information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information.\nFor example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order form.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our products or services, we will ask you for your friend\u2019s name and email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend emails inviting him or her to visit the Site.\nThis personal information may be used to track the success of our referral program.\nYour friend

personal information and non-personal information with other parties for a variety of purposes, as described below.</p>\n<p>Analytics and online behavioral advertising.\nWe partner with certain third parties to collect the non-personal information discussed above and to engage in analysis, auditing, research, and reporting.\nThese third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device.</p>\n<p>The Site also enables third-party tracking mechanisms to collect your non-personal information for use in online behavioral advertising.\nFor example, third parties may use the fact that you visited the Site to target online ads for Simply Earth services to you on non-Simply Earth websites or services.\nIn addition, our third-party advertising networks might use information about your use of the Site to help target non-Simply Earth advertisements based on your online behavior in general.</p>\n<p>The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject to those third parties\u2019 own privacy policies, and not this Policy.\nIf you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing cookies on your

features will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines.\nSuch information can be read, collected, and/or used by others, and it could be used to send you unsolicited messages if you disclose personal information.\nAccordingly, please take care when using these features of the Site.</p>\n<p>Your direct sharing of personal information through third-party websites and services.\nThe Site may enable you to share directly personal information with websites or online services operated by third parties.\nFor example, the Site contains links to third-party websites that incorporate comment and social media features.\nThe Site may also contain a Facebook \"like\" button, a Twitter \"follow\" button, or similar features.\nIf you choose to use these features, you may disclose your personal information not just to those third-party websites and services, but also to their users and the public more generally.\nBecause these third-party websites and services are not operated by Simply Earth, we are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services.\nThe collection, use, and disclosure of your personal and non-personal information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy.</p>\n<p>Third-party plugins.\nThe Site integrates certain third-party plug-ins (such as a Facebook \"like\" button).\nEven if you do not click on these plug-ins, they may collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that you view.\nThey also may set and/or access a cookie.\nThese plugins are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>\n<p>Legal purposes.\nWe also may use or share your personal or non-personal information

insuring, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets.</p>\n<p>Aggregated information.\nFrom time to time, Simply Earth may also share de-identified and aggregated information about Site users, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Site.</p>\n<p>Security\nSimply Earth uses commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or unauthorized access, use, modification, or deletion.\nWhen you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).\nHowever, no security program is foolproof, and thus we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal or other information.</p>\n<p>Reviewing and updating your information\nIf you want to learn more about the personal information that Simply Earth has about you, or you would like to update or change that information, or deactivate your account, please contact us by email at help@simplyearth.com.</p>\n<p>Note that deactivating your account does not cause your account information

personal and non-personal information that we collect through or in connection with the Site is transferred to and processed in the United States for the purposes described above.\nSimply Earth also
