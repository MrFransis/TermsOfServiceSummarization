legitimate interests of the organization, including whether granting the request would endanger the organization\u2019s right to religious freedom and practice.\nWe will also notify any third-party recipients of the necessary changes.</p>\n<p>Please note that your data may not be erased if processing is required by law or if the data may be kept on other legal bases.\nFor example, the religious organization has an interest in permanently maintaining data regarding an individual\u2019s status as one of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.\nDeleting such information would unduly infringe on the organization\u2019s religious beliefs and practices.\nRequests to delete personal data are subject to any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements imposed on us.\nYou may also

collection of personal and sensitive personal data in order to administer to the needs of individual Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses and to accomplish its religious and charitable activity, as well as the corresponding necessity to maintain confidentiality and ensure that information is adequately protected.\n(Proverbs 15:22.\n25:9) We highly value confidentiality.\u2014Proverbs 20:19.</p>\n<p>Various

organization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> Due consideration will be given to respecting the rights of data subjects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> Appropriate technical and organizational measures will be taken to prevent unauthorized or unlawful disclosure of personal data.\nAll computer-held personal data is maintained on password-protected computers to which only authorized users hold passwords.\nOffices are locked after office hours, and only authorized staff may gain entry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> Personal data will not be transferred between branches unless this is necessary to accomplish the religious or charitable purposes of the religious organization.\nAll Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses have consented to this by virtue of their free and willing decision to become and identify themselves as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These data protection principles govern the use of personal data outlined in the book <em>Organized to Do Jehovah\u2019s Will</em>, which is given to
