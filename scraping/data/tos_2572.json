laws and regulations.\nUnder this HP Limited Warranty, HP Hardware Products purchased in one country or region may be transferred to another country or region where HP or its authorized service providers offer warranty service for the same product model numbers.\nWarranty terms, service availability, and service response times may vary from country or region to country or region.\nStandard

that it will again repair or replace these HP Hardware Products or parts.</p>\n<br>\n<p>All component parts or hardware products removed under this HP Limited Warranty become the property of HP unless

HP, at its option, may elect to provide you with (a) a replacement unit selected by HP that is the same or functionally equivalent to your HP Hardware Product in performance or (b) to give you a refund or credit of your purchase price or lease payments (less interest) instead of a replacement.\nTo the extent permitted by local law, this is your exclusive remedy for defective products.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Some states or countries do not allow the above exclusion or limitation, so this exclusion and limitation may be limited in its application to you.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Disputes arising out of this HP Limited Warranty or relating to your purchase of the HP Hardware Products subject to this HP Limited Warranty\u2014whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, or any other

cycles.\nThis HP Hardware Product may include an internal rechargeable non-removable battery that is not user accessible and must be replaced by HP or an HP authorized service provider.\nThe internal

will decrease with time or use, and battery cycle life will vary depending on product model, configuration, loaded applications, features, use, wireless functionality, and power management settings.\nAccordingly, a decrease in maximum battery capacity or battery cycle life is not a defect in materials or workmanship, and this HP Limited Warranty does not cover changes in battery capacity or battery cycle life.\nTo the extent permitted by local law, the battery is only warranted against defects in materials or workmanship resulting in failure of the battery to operate for the duration of the Limited Warranty Period for the battery as specified above or in the event that the battery cycle life exceeds the battery rated cycle count, whichever comes first, unless otherwise specified in this HP Limited Warranty.\nTo determine whether your battery has had a warranted failure, you may be required to run an HP diagnostic test.</p>\n<br> HP Printing Products\n<p>The use of a non-HP or refilled cartridge does not affect either the HP Limited Warranty to the end-user customer or any HP support contract with the end-user customer for the printer.\nHowever, if printer or print head failure or damage is attributable to the use of a non-HP or refilled cartridge, HP will charge its standard time and materials charges to service the printer for the particular failure or damage or for the cost to replace the print head.\nFor HP ink cartridges and supplies and HP LaserJet supplies, this HP Limited Warranty does not apply to products that, in addition to other exclusions described in this HP Limited Warranty, have been refilled, refurbished, remanufactured, or tampered with in any way.\nThis HP Limited Warranty pertains to HP ink cartridges, print heads, or
