Company Parties.</p> 13.\nDisclaimers <p>\n<strong>Your use of our Services is at your sole risk.\nOur Services are provided \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available\u201d without warranties of any

liability, warranty, or otherwise\u2014for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits, even if the Company or the other Company Parties have been

responsibility, liability, claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including, but not limited to, claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties.\n<strong>You expressly waive any rights you may have under California Civil Code \u00a7 1542 as well as any other statute or common law principles that would otherwise limit the coverage of this release to include only those claims which you may know or suspect to exist in your favor at the time of agreeing to this release.</strong>\n</p> 16.\nDispute Resolution.\nArbitration <p>\n<strong>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Company and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong>\n</p> 17.1.\nBinding Arbitration <p>Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, <strong>\u201cDisputes\u201d</strong>) in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and the Company (a) waive your and the Company\u2019s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in a court, and (b) waive your and the Company\u2019s respective rights to a jury trial.\nInstead, you and the Company will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).</p> 17.2.\nNo Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions <p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services is personal to you and the Company and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.\nThere will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.\nFurther, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p> 17.3.\nFederal Arbitration Act <p>These Terms affect interstate commerce and the enforceability of this Section 16 will be both substantively and procedurally governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(the <strong>\u201cFAA\u201d</strong>), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.</p> 17.4.\nNotice.\nInformal Dispute Resolution <p>Each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.\nNotice to the Company will be sent by e-mail to the Company at hello@lbry.com Notice to you will be by email to the then-current email address in your Account.\nYour notice must include (a) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking.\nIf you and the Company cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or the Company may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 16, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 16.1, file a claim in court.\n</p> 17.5.\nProcess <p>Any arbitration will occur in New Castle County, Delaware.\nArbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<strong>\u201cJAMS\u201d</strong>), which are hereby incorporated by reference.\nThe state and federal courts located in New Castle County, Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.\nYou may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county where you reside if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.\n</p> 17.6.\nAuthority of Arbitrator <p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nprovided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p> 17.7.\nRules of JAMS <p>The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website.\nBy agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p> 18.\nGoverning Law and Venue <p>These Terms and your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\nAny Dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to these Terms that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware and the United States, respectively, sitting in New Castle County, Delaware.\n</p> 19.\nSeverability <p>If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.</p> 20.\nTermination or Suspension <p>Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate this agreement or suspend your right to access the Services.\nYou may terminate this agreement without notice by discontinuing use of the Services.\nAll rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will immediately be revoked upon our termination of the agreement or our suspension of your access to the Services.\nWe make no representations that termination or suspension of the Services will prevent the spread or distribution of published Content through LBRY.</p> 21.\nAmendment <p>We reserve the right to change these Terms from time to time upon notice to you.\nIf we make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes by posting the revised Terms to the Services and updating the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the top of these Terms.\nIn some cases, we may provide additional notice to you, such as via our Services or to an email address associated with your Account.\nYour continued use of the Services following our provision of any such notice will confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms.\nIf you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Services.\n</p> 22.\nSurvival <p>The following sections will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: all defined terms and Sections 12 - 18, 21 and 22.</p> 23.\nMiscellaneous <p>These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Company relating to your access to and use of the Services.\nWe may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms.\nUnder no circumstances may you assign your rights and obligations under these Terms, including in the event of change of control or by operation of law, without our prior written consent.\nThe failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\nWe will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under these Terms where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control.\nExcept as otherwise provided in herein, the agreement is intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</p> 24.\nExport Control and Prohibited Use <p>Use of the Service and Software, including transferring, posting, or uploading data, software or other Content via the Service, may be subject to the export and import laws of the United States and other countries.\nYou agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and regulations.\nIn particular, but without limitation, the Software may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.\nembargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury Department\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce Denied Person\u2019s List or Entity List.\nBy using the Software or Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also agree that you will not use the Software or Service for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.\nYou further agree not to upload to your Account any data or software that is: (a) subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations.\nor (b) that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization, including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software and source code, without first obtaining that authorization.\nThis assurance and commitment shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Company</li>\n<li>About</li>\n<li>Blog</li>\n<li>Roadmap</li>\n<li>Shop</li>\n<li>Team</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use
