principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our

We are the folks behind MyDramaList.com, the platform that gives fans of asian films and TV shows a voice to rate &amp.\nreview titles, create a watchlist, socialize with other fans and so much more.\nThis Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use MyDramaList.com</p>\n<p>Throughout this Privacy Policy we\u2019ll refer to our website and other services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>Information We Collect<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so\u2013for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.\nWe collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p>Information You Provide to Us<p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.\nThe amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a MyDramaList.com account to provide a username and email address\u2013and that\u2019s it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Public Profile Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\nFor example, if you have a MyDramaList account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, such as a photo or an \u201cAbout Me\u201d description.\nYour public profile information is just that\u2013public\u2013so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Transaction and Billing Information:</strong> If you purchase a VIP subscription or any merchandise we may sell from us, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Communications With Us (Hi There!):</strong> You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our support staff via email or private message about a support question, or post in our public forums.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Information We Collect Automatically</em>\n<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log Information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that users perform on the site \u2013in other words, who did what, when and to what thing (e.g., user posted a comment on \u2018x\u2019 page at so and so time).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from Cookies &amp.\nOther Technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on emails.\nMyDramaList uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Information We Collect from Other Sources</em>\n<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you create or log into your MyDramaList.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Connected feature, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p>\nHow And Why We Use Information<em>Purposes for Using Information</em>\n<p>We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide our Services\u2013for example, to set up and maintain your account, charge you for any of our paid Services;</li>\n<li>To further develop and improve our

Information</em>\n<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information

without delay</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, user

connect to your site through our Connect feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Published Support Requests:</strong> And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Information Shared Publicly</em>\n<p>Information that you choose to make public is\u2013you guessed it\u2013disclosed publicly.\nThat means, of course, that information like your public profile, posts, other content
