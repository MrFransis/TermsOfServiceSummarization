dispute arises between us, you agree that the following terms will apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of Cotton Bureau services, websites, or operations, or arising out or related to of our relationship or this agreement, must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</li>\n<li>Any disputes arising out of your use of our services, websites, or operations, or arising out of or related to our relationship or this agreement, shall be governed by the ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AGREEMENT REGARDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES included below.</li>\n<li>Subject to the provisions of the ADDITIONAL TERMS OF AGREEMENT REGARDING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, which shall control, You and Cotton Bureau agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, or courts having appellate jurisdiction over those courts.\nIf you live in a country with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph does not override those rights.</li>\n</ul> Governing Law <p>These Terms will be governed by Pennsylvania law except for its conflicts of laws principles.\nSome countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer\u2019s country or require that their substantive laws, including privacy laws, apply.\nThis section does not override those laws.</p> Third-Party Beneficiaries <p>You agree that Cotton Bureau\u2019s employees, representatives, management, and affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of Cotton Bureau\u2019s rights under this agreement.</p>\n<p>There are no other third-party beneficiaries of this agreement.</p> Entire Agreement and Severability to Conform to Law <p>This is the entire agreement between you and Cotton Bureau, replacing any earlier agreements between you and us, regarding your use of our services and websites.</p>\n<p>No person has the authority to alter or waive our rights or your obligations under these terms unless an officer or counsel of Cotton Bureau executes a document agreeing to such an alteration or waiver.</p>\n<p>If a court determines any provision of this Agreement to be illegal or unenforceable, the parties agree to sever that provision from this Agreement, with all other provisions remaining in force.</p> Additional Terms of Agreement Regarding Arbitration of Disputes <p>Cotton Bureau believes that most disagreements can be resolved informally and efficiently by contacting Cotton Bureau customer support.\nIf You are a U.S.\ncustomer, and the dispute is not resolved through Cotton Bureau customer support, You and Cotton Bureau agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Software and Services or this License Agreement (a \u201cClaim\u201d), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, as follows:</p> Small Claims Court <p>You may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.\nYou agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in the United States.</p> Arbitration <p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.&nbsp.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.&nbsp.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to this License Agreement, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that You and Cotton Bureau are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.&nbsp.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this License Agreement and/or the termination of Your Cotton Bureau product license.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice of Claim:</strong> If You elect to seek arbitration, You must first send to Cotton Bureau, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim (\"Notice of Claim\").&nbsp.\nThe Notice of Claim to Cotton Bureau should be addressed to: Nathan Peretic, Cotton Bureau, 110 Torrens St.\nSuite 101, Pittsburgh, PA 15206 and should be prominently captioned \u201cNOTICE OF CLAIM\u201d.&nbsp.\nThe Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like Cotton Bureau to use to contact You.\nIf Cotton Bureau elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to Your billing address on file.\nA Notice of Claim, whether sent by You or by Cotton Bureau, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\n(b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought (\"Demand\").\nand (c) whether You reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Cotton Bureau (see Section 12(B)(e)).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Proceedings:</strong> If You and Cotton Bureau do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, You or Cotton Bureau may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).&nbsp.\nYou may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this License Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.&nbsp.\nThe AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this License Agreement.&nbsp.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.</p>\n<p>Unless Cotton Bureau and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either Your residence or of the mailing address You provided in Your Notice of Claim.&nbsp.\nIf Your claim is for U.S.\n$10,000 or less, Cotton Bureau agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.&nbsp.\nIf Your claim exceeds U.S.\n$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.&nbsp.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief:</strong> Except as set forth in the Small Claims Court provision above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by You or Cotton Bureau, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nTo the extent that You or Cotton Bureau prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees:</strong> If Your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Cotton Bureau will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including reimbursement of Your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in Your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nIf Your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver: YOU AND Cotton Bureau AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong>&nbsp.\nFurther, if You have elected arbitration, unless both You and Cotton Bureau agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with Your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.&nbsp.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Modification of Dispute Resolution Section:</strong> If Cotton Bureau changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date You first accepted this License Agreement, and You have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, You may reject any such change by so stating within Your Notice of Claim.\nBy failing to reject any changes to this Dispute Resolution section in Your Notice of Claim, You agree to resolve any Claim between You and Cotton Bureau in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of Your Notice of Claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability:</strong>&nbsp.\nWith the exception of the Class Action Waiver provisions noted above, if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement shall still apply.</p> Additional Terms of Agreement That Apply to Designers, Marketers, and Sellers
