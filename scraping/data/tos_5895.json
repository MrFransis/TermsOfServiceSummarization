Anvil.\nWe refer separately to people who use the apps you build with Anvil, but we\u2019re careful with their privacy too.\nYou also have responsibilities to your users \u2013 see below.)</p> What information do we collect, and why? <ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you sign up for Anvil (or our mailing list), we require an email address.\nThis is used to identify your account and get in touch with you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While you use Anvil, we collect data to record how you use the product.\nThis includes pages you visit and actions you perform (such as creating, editing and running Anvil Apps).\nWe do this in order to improve the product (for example, identifying where people get stuck), and to identify active and inactive accounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We record IP addresses of both you and the users of your app, to record the approximate (city-level) location of Anvil users so we can manage and scale our infrastructure, and to prevent abuse.\nWe don\u2019t record anything else about your app users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you open marketing emails, we track when you open them (if you have image loading enabled).\nWe do this to see what is and isn\u2019t interesting to our customers, and avoid spamming people with emails they\u2019re not interested in.\nYou can opt out of marketing emails at any time by clicking \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d at the bottom of any email from us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We store your app itself: its source code, and the data stored in your data tables.\nWhen your app runs and produces log output, we store it so that you can access it via the App Logs interface.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To help us manage our systems, we keep diagnostic logs.\nThese may incidentally include information like email addresses or what is happening in our systems (which could be used to work out what you were doing).\nWe use these logs for managing and debugging our software and services, and we delete them after 90 days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also store backups of all this information (apart from the diagnostic logs), to help with disaster recovery.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can choose not to provide this information (or to ask us to delete it), but without it we will not be able to provide you with the Anvil service.</p> Who do we share your information with? <p>We share your email address with our email provider (SendGrid), as part of sending email to you.\nIf you use the live chat feature on the Anvil website, we send your email address and chat messages through our chat provider (Drift).\nWe do use Google Analytics (on the Anvil website, not for visitors to your apps), but no personally identifying information is shared with them.</p> Who are we? <p>Anvil is a product from The Tuesday Project Ltd, a UK-registered company.\nOur company number is 09704308 and our registered address is 185 Green End Road, Cambridge, UK, CB4 1RJ.\nIf you need to get in touch with us about privacy or data protection, please email privacy@anvil.works.</p> Your data protection rights <p>Under European data protection rules, you have the following rights.\nYou can learn more about them from the UK Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.\nTo summarise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Information</strong> - You should know what we\u2019re collecting, and why.\nThis page is about explaining this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Access</strong> and <strong>Portability</strong> - You should be able to get a copy of data we hold about you, in a machine-readable format so you can move it to another service.\nWe try hard to make it easy to download your apps and data from the Anvil editor.\nFor any other enquiries, email privacy@anvil.works.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Rectification</strong> - If any information we hold about you is incorrect, you have the right to correct it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Erasure</strong> or <strong>Restriction</strong> - Upon request, we will delete all information about you from our database for which we don\u2019t have a good reason to keep using it (eg abuse prevention).\nFor technical reasons, it\u2019s infeasible to remove your information from our historical backups \u2013 instead, we\u2019ll store the fact that you\u2019ve requested erasure, and make sure to immediately delete that data if we ever need to restore those backups.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Objection</strong> - You can object to our keeping or processing your data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, privacy@anvil.works is the place to send any of these requests.</p> Changes to this privacy policy <p>If you\u2019re a registered user, we\u2019ll

not a registered user, we can\u2019t get in touch with you, so you\u2019ll have to come back and check this page.</p>\n<p>If need to change the way we collect or process information about your app users, in a way that requires updating this privacy policy, we\u2019ll let you know by email at least 2 weeks in advance.</p> Your responsibility to your users <p>\nAll we collect about your users (people who use apps you build with Anvil) are their IP addresses and the times of their visit, and we only use this to manage our infrastructure and prevent abuse.</p>\n<p>You, however, might collect more.\nWhether you store this information in Anvil\u2019s Data Tables, App Logs or with an external service, you need to comply with the appropriate data protection rules.\nAs author of an app that collects personal data, you are the \u201cdata controller\u201d under European data protection laws.\nwe are a \u201cdata processor\u201d.\nIf you or your users are in the European Union, you are also
