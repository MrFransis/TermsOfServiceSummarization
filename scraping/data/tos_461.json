here.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in connection with your use of our services, including those offered through our websites, communications (e.g., emails, phone calls, and texts), and mobile applications (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Service</strong>\u201d).\nThe terms \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d, and \u201c<strong>Yelp</strong>\u201d refer to: (i) Yelp Inc., a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in San Francisco,

resolved in favor of the English version available here.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>TABLE OF CONTENTS</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Information We Collect and How We Use

transmit, and store information about you in connection with your use of the Service, including any information you send to or through the Service.\nWe use that information to provide the Service\u2019s functionality, fulfill your requests, improve the Service\u2019s quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the Service, personalize your experience, track usage of the Service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the Service, display relevant advertising, market the Service, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the Service, and comply with legal obligations.\nEven when we do not retain such information, it still must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process.</p>\n<p>Please also note:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create a Yelp account, we store and use the information you provide during that process, such as the first and last name you enter, email address, zip code, physical address, and any other information you may provide during the account creation process, such as a gender, phone number, or birth date.\nWe may publicly display the first name and last initial that you provide, as well as any photo or other content you submit through the account creation process, as part of your account profile.\nWe also store and use any preferences you provide to personalize your user experience, including dining and activity preferences.\nYou can later modify some of the account information you provide through your account settings.\nIf you believe that someone has created an unauthorized account using your personal information, you can request its removal by flagging it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Content:</strong> Your contributions to the Service are intended for public consumption and are therefore viewable by the public, including your photos, ratings, reviews, tips, lists, Collections, compliments, Ask the Community posts, Yelp Talk posts, and edits to business page information.\nYour account profile (e.g., first name, last initial, city, neighborhood, the month and year you created your Yelp account, profile photos and list of friends on Yelp) is also intended for public consumption, as is some of your other activity through the Service, like how you vote on other people\u2019s contributions (e.g., useful, funny, cool, helpful, or not helpful), which contributions you like, where you check-in (including when friends on Yelp tag you in their own check-ins), which contributions or users you follow, and which businesses you follow or bookmark.\nYou can limit the public nature of some of these activities through your account settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contacts:</strong> You can invite others to join or become your friend on Yelp by providing us with their contact information, or by allowing us to access contacts from your computer, mobile device, or third party sites to select which individuals you want to invite.\nIf you allow us to access your contacts, we will transmit information about your contacts to our servers long enough to process your invitations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications:</strong> When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other users, businesses, and Yelp.\nYou can manage some of your messaging preferences through your account settings, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Yelp.\nFor example, if you make a reservation, order food, place yourself on a waitlist, or request a quote from a business through the Service, we may send you messages about your transaction using the contact information you provide, including through automated SMS text messages to your phone number.\nWe may also track your actions in response to the messages you receive from us or through the Service, such as whether you deleted, opened, or forwarded such messages, and share that information with other parties to your messages (for example, to let them know if you have viewed their message).\nWhen a user requests a quote or similar information from multiple businesses through the Service, we may disclose to those businesses information about the status of the user\u2019s requests, such as whether any business has responded to the request, the type of response provided (for example, a quote or a request for more information), and whether the user has responded to any business\u2019s reply.\n<strong>If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.</strong> We may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages, fraudulent solicitations, or requests to exchange reviews for compensation.\nIf you send or receive messages through the Service via SMS text message, we may log phone numbers, phone carriers, and the date and time that the messages were processed.\nCarriers may charge recipients for texts that they receive.\nWe may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person.\nIf you are a representative of a business listed on Yelp, or use a phone number associated now or previously with such a business, we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business.\nOur communications with you, including phone calls, may be monitored and recorded for quality purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transactions: </strong>If you initiate a transaction through the Service, such as a reservation or purchase, we will collect and store information you provide associated with your transaction, such as your name, phone number, address, email, and payment information, as well as any other information you provide, in order to process your transaction, send communications about the transaction to you, and facilitate future transactions.\nThis information may be shared with third parties, and third parties may share such information with us, for the same purposes.\nWhen you submit credit card numbers and other sensitive payment information, that information is encrypted using industry standard technology.\nIf you write reviews about businesses with which you transact through the Service, we may publicly display the fact that you transacted with those businesses in connection with such reviews.\nFor example, if you make a dining reservation through the Service and later write a review about your experience, we may publicly display the fact that you made your reservation through the Service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Activity:</strong> We store information about your use of the Service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and time of your visits, businesses you call using our mobile applications, and reservations, purchases, or transactions you make through the Service.\nWe also store information that your computer or mobile device may provide to us in connection with your use of the Service, such as your browser type, type of computer or mobile device, browser language, IP address, WiFi information such as SSID, mobile carrier, phone number, unique device identifier, advertising identifier, location (including geolocation, beacon based location, and GPS location), and requested and referring URLs and mobile applications.\nWe may also receive and store your location whenever our mobile applications are running, including when running in the background, if you enable our mobile apps to access such information in the course of using the Service.\nYou may be able to limit or disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example by adjusting the settings for our applications in iOS or Android privacy settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Different Devices:</strong> You may access the Service through different devices (e.g., your mobile phone or personal computer) and different platforms (e.g., the Yelp website or Yelp mobile apps).\nThe information that we collect and store through those different uses may be cross-referenced and combined, and your contributions through one Yelp platform will typically be similarly visible and accessible through all other Yelp platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Professional Information:</strong> If you represent a business on Yelp, we may collect and display information about you related to your business activities, such as a business name that may incorporate your name, or a publicly available business address that is also used as a home address.\nWe will also collect and display information about your professional background that you choose to share with us through the Service, such as information about your professional licenses or certifications, or your professional history or specialties.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal Basis for Processing (EEA and Switzerland only):</strong> For European Residents, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the specific information concerned and the context in which we collect it.\nWe, however, will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for instance, to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations).\nIf we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).\nIf we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will typically be to operate our Services, communicate with you in relation to our Services, or for our other legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, to analyze and improve our platform, engage in marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing fraud.\nIf you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us at the address listed below in the \u201cContact\u201d section.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>COOKIES<br>\n</strong>\n<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called \u201cflash cookies\u201d), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple\u2019s Identifier for Advertisers (\u201cIDFA\u201d) or Google\u2019s Advertising ID (\u201cGAID\u201d)) and similar technology (\u201c<strong>Cookies</strong>\u201d) in connection with your use of the Service, third party websites, and mobile applications.\nCookies may contain unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages.\nCookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have interacted with, and the date and time of your use.\nCookies may be persistent or stored only during an individual session.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nManage cookies\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The purposes for which we use Cookies in the Service include:</p>\n<p>\n</p> Purpose\nExplanation Processes\nIntended to make the Service work in the way you expect.\nFor example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have already signed up for an account.\nAuthentication, Security, and Compliance\nIntended to prevent fraud, protect your data from unauthorized parties, and comply with legal requirements.\nFor example, we use Cookies to determine if you are logged in.\nPreferences\nIntended to remember information about how you prefer the Service to behave and look.\nFor example, we use a Cookie that tells us whether you have declined to allow us to send push notifications to your phone.\nNotifications\nIntended to allow or prevent notices of information or options that we think could improve your use of the Service.\nFor example, we use a Cookie that stops us from showing you the signup notification if you have already seen it.\nAdvertising\nIntended to make advertising more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers.\nFor example, we may use Cookies to serve you interest-based ads, such as ads that are displayed to you based on your visits to other websites, or to tell us if you have recently interacted with an ad.\nAnalytics\nIntended to help us understand how visitors use the Service.\nFor example, we use a Cookie that tells us how our search suggestions correlate to your interactions with the search page.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can set some Cookie preferences through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of the Service.\nThe method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in your device or browser preferences or security settings.\nFor example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking.\nFor flash cookies, you can manage your privacy settings by clicking here.\nPlease note that changing any of these settings does not prevent the display of certain advertisements to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>THIRD PARTIES<br>\n</strong>\n<p>Third parties may receive information about you as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertisers:</strong> We allow third parties to use Cookies through the Service to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as we do.\nIn doing so, we adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nThird parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources.\nWe do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use, but you may be able to opt out of some of their practices by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative, Omniture and Digital Advertising Alliance.\nPlease note that opting out does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.\nWe may also share some non-identifiable, de-identified or aggregated information from or about you, such as location information, with third parties in connection with advertising programs and data analytics.\nYou may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or through the Service\u2019s settings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content Partners:</strong> We allow third party partners to use and display some of the public content available through the Service, such as your photos, reviews, and other information listed under \u201cPublic Content\u201d in Section 1 above.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Service Providers:</strong> We rely on third party service providers to support or provide services for us in connection with your use of the Service, such as food delivery services, communications and hosting, security and fraud prevention, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting usage of the Service, quality assurance testing, payment processing, marketing, and other functions.\nWe share information from or about you with these third party providers so that they can perform their services or complete your requests.\nFor example, we may share your advertising identifiers (e.g., your IDFA, GAID, or a cryptographic hash of your email address) with third party service providers that help us facilitate Yelp\u2019s advertising programs and measure and report their effectiveness, including with third parties that help determine the efficacy of Yelp\u2019s advertising programs by combining information they receive about you from other sources than the Service.\nYou may be able to limit our access to some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described in Section 2 above, or through the Service\u2019s settings.\nYelp\u2019s third party service providers may likewise share information with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services or completing your requests.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregate or Anonymous Information:</strong> We share user information in the aggregate with third parties, such as businesses that are listed on Yelp and content distributors.\nFor example, we disclose the number of users that have been exposed to or interacted with advertisements, or that we believe visited the physical location of a particular business.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We share information from or about you with our parent companies, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control, and require them to also honor this Privacy Policy.\nIf another company acquires Yelp, or all or substantially all our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will collect, use, and disclose the information only as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Businesses on Yelp:</strong> We may share information from or about you (such as your city, and if you provide it, your age and gender), your device type, and your use of the Service (such as which businesses you bookmark or call, or if you visit a business\u2019s URL) with businesses on Yelp.\nYou may adjust your account settings to increase or decrease the amount of information we share.\nKeep in mind that businesses can also view your public activity and posts, and may receive information from or about you when you transact or communicate with them, through Yelp or otherwise, regardless of your settings (see Section 1 above).\nAdditionally, if you make a phone call to a business through or in connection with your use of the Service, we may share information about your call with the business that the business would have received had you called them directly, such as the date and time of your call and your phone number.\nYou may be able to limit our ability to collect and share your phone number through your phone settings or phone service provider.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Investigations and Legal Disclosures:</strong> We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure: (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal or law enforcement processes, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process or law enforcement request.\n(b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.\nor (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public, such as disclosures in connection with Yelp\u2019s Consumer Alerts program.\nIf you flag or otherwise complain to us about content through the Service, we may share the substance of your complaint with the contributor of that content in order to provide an opportunity for the contributor to respond.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Links:</strong> The Service may link to third party-controlled websites, like a business\u2019s URL.\nExcept as set forth herein, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for their privacy practices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third Party Integrations:</strong> If you sign up for, or log into, Yelp using a third party service like Facebook or Google, or link your Yelp account to your account with a third party service like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, we may receive information about you from such third party service.\nIf you post content to a third party service through the Service, that third party service will also receive that content, which will be visible to anyone that has access to it through that third party service.\nSome of our web pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to you from our third party partners, while preserving the look and feel of the Service.\nIn such cases, please note that the information you provide may be transmitted directly to the identified third party partner.\nIf you interact with businesses through Yelp, they will receive whatever information you choose to share with them, for example contact information you share through direct messages to the business or your phone number if you call the business.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA<br>\n</strong>\n<p>Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly.\nYou can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Service pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service.\nYelp users can also use the Find Friends feature to find one another based on their names or email addresses (you can limit your visibility for this feature in your account settings).\nPlease also note that the messages you send or receive using the Service are only private to the extent that both you and the recipient(s) of your messages keep them private.\nFor example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it.\nWe may access, review, and disclose such messages in connection with investigations related to use of the Service, as well as our efforts to improve the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION<br>\n</strong>\n<p>You can close your account by clicking here.\nWe will remove certain public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law.\nFor example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations.\nWe may also maintain residual copies of your personal information in our backup systems.\nPlease note that businesses cannot remove their business pages, ratings, or reviews by closing their accounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CHILDREN<br>\n</strong>\n<p>The Service is intended for general audiences and is not directed to children under 13.\nWe do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.\nIf you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, please contact us here.\nIf we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child\u2019s account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SECURITY<br>\n</strong>\n<p>We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after we receive it.\nHowever, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CONTACT INFORMATION <br>\n</strong>\n<p>You may contact us online concerning our Privacy Policy,

responding to the lead and the speed of those responses.\nand</li>\n<li>you understand and acknowledge that non-disparagement clauses in certain consumer contracts, such as clauses that seek to restrict or prohibit reviews (including provisions that penalize consumers for posting reviews) about your Business, are prohibited under California law (Cal.\nCivil Code \u00a7 1670.8) and under the federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (15 U.S.\nCode \u00a7 45b) and you agree that you will not include such clauses in your consumer contracts, or otherwise attempt to enforce non-disparagement or

(<strong>\u201cRecommendation Software\u201d</strong>).\nYou understand and acknowledge that while Yelp uses its Recommendation Software to identify potentially less helpful reviews, the Recommendation Software may sometimes suppress legitimate reviews or fail to detect illegitimate reviews.\nYou understand and acknowledge that any purchase of advertising or other paid features from Yelp will not influence the Recommendation Software or otherwise allow or enable You, directly or indirectly, to alter reviews or impact whether, where, or how reviews appear on

computer services, like Yelp, for their role in publishing third-party Content, including consumer reviews.\nAdditionally, anti-SLAPP laws, such as Cal.\nCiv.\nProc.\nCode&nbsp.\n\u00a7 425.16 in California, may require you to pay Yelp\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees if you attempt to impose such liability on Yelp through legal proceedings.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>ARBITRATION, DISPUTES, AND CHOICE OF LAW<br>\n</strong>\n<strong>FOR CLARITY, THIS SECTION GOVERNS ANY BUSINESS CLAIM BROUGHT BY YOU OR YELP.\nANY CLAIM NOT SUBJECT TO THIS SECTION IS INSTEAD GOVERNED BY SECTION 13 OF THE TERMS.<br>\n</strong>Except for Excluded Business Claims, any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to: (a) these Terms, or the breach thereof.\nor (b) your access to or use of your Business Account Business Site.\n(each such controversy or claim, a \u201c<strong>Business</strong>\n<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d), shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator will issue a reasoned award in writing, including all findings of fact and law upon which the award was made.\nThe arbitrator will not have the power to commit errors of law, and the award may be vacated or corrected through judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction under the California Arbitration Act for any such error.\n\u201c<strong>Excluded Business Claims</strong>\u201d means Claims related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks) or violations of Section 7 of the Terms of Service (Representations and Warranties).\n<p>Business Claims shall be heard by a single arbitrator.\nArbitrations will be held in San Francisco, California, but the parties may choose for themselves whether to appear in person, by phone, or through the submission of documents.\nThe arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.\nThe prevailing party shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p>NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, FOR ANY BUSINESS CLAIM THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION EXCLUDED BUSINESS CLAIMS, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT AND CONSENT TO THE PERSONAL AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IN, AND THE
