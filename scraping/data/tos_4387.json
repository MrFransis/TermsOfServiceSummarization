geographic area.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>U.S.\ncardholders can opt out of Visa using their card transaction data for VAS.\nThis opt out will not limit our use of data in other aspects of Visa's business,

programs, and we may disclose information about you and your payment transactions based on the consent that you provided the rewards company to enable it to provide the rewards.\nFor example, if you sign up to receive offers from a travel partner through Visa, we may share your personal information with that partner as needed to operate the program, validate referrals, and measure success of the promotions.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We may share your information with other third parties as permitted by law, such as when we sell or transfer business assets, enforce our contracts, protect our property or the rights, property or safety of others, or as needed for audits, compliance, and corporate governance.</p>\n<p>We will also disclose personal information when required to do so by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to law enforcement agencies, regulators and courts in the United States and other countries where we operate.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</dd>\n<dt> Online Privacy

about how your issuer, any merchants or rewards networks handles your personal information, please check the privacy notices provided by these companies and contact them directly for assistance with any privacy requests.\nWhen Visa acts as a service provider (also called a data processor) for our clients, we only process your information as instructed by our client to provide the services and for other appropriate purposes, such as recordkeeping and compliance.\nWe rely on our clients to provide you with appropriate privacy notices and to manage your privacy rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Visa
