meaning the GDPR applies to any organization that processes EU personal data, regardless of where the organization may be located.\n\u201cPersonal data\u201d is a term that the GDPR broadly defines, but in general it can be thought of as any data that can personally identify an individual or make them identifiable.</p>\nDoes Olark support GDPR compliance?\n<p>Yes.\nOlark is committed to helping you be GDPR compliant.\nWe have worked hard with our legal and engineering teams to ensure to the extent Olark directly collects EU personal data it is in compliance with the GDPR.</p>\n<p>We are fully compliant with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss \u2013 U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.</p>\nWhat does the GDPR mean for Olark customers?\n<p>If you are using Olark\u2019s products or services to collect information (such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, etc.) from individuals who reside in the European Union, then the GDPR will place additional constraints on the way you handle and use that information.</p>\n<p>Olark offers built-in features to help you with your GDPR compliance efforts, and we will continue to support you in achieving compliance with this and similar privacy legislation.</p>\n<p>To best understand your role and Olark\u2019s role under the GDPR, it\u2019s critical to understand three key terms as they relate to our services: data subjects, data controllers, and data processors.\nThe data subjects are your customers or end users residing in the EU.\nYou are the data controller because you decide the purposes for which you need to collect personal data from data subjects and the means by which you want to collect it.\nOlark is a data processor because we process data from your data subjects on your behalf and on your instructions.</p>\n<p>Some other key obligations under the GDPR include:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice:</strong> Organizations are required to provide notice to data subjects whenever they collect personal data from the data subject.\nIn the notice, organizations must identify the lawful basis for processing the personal data (see Article 6 of the GDPR), among other things.\nData controllers must determine which lawful basis applies to their processing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Individual Rights:</strong> The GDPR expands data subjects\u2019 rights to their personal data.\nExcept as limited by applicable law, EU data subjects have the right to access the personal data a company is processing on them.\nto restrict the processing.\nto correct incomplete or inaccurate personal data.\nto have their personal data deleted.\nand to object to their data being used for certain purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retention:</strong> One of the core principles of the GDPR is \u201cdata minimization.\u201d The GDPR requires that EU personal data should not be kept any \u201cno longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed.\u201d It is the responsibility of the data controller to determine the appropriate time period for which to retain EU personal data and, as applicable, convey those periods to their data processors and/or data subjects.</p>\nWhat is Olark doing about GDPR?\nDoes Olark have a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)?\n<p>Yes.\nPlease email gdpr@olark.com with the name and email address of the member of your organization authorized to sign our DPA, and we will send you our standard agreement.</p>\n<p>If you would like to modify the standard DPA, or if your business requires a custom DPA, you will need to move to an enterprise plan.\nYou can email gdpr@olark.com for more information.</p>\nCan I use Olark and still be GDPR-compliant?\n<p>Yes! Olark is committed to supporting your GDPR compliance efforts.\nWe\u2019ve provided responses to common compliance questions below.</p>\nWill Olark handle notice requirements for me?\n<p>Olark cannot handle notice requirements on our customers\u2019 behalf.\nhowever, we have provided tools to communicate notice to your website visitors via the Olark chatbox.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Additional context:</em> As the data controller, you are required to provide notice to individuals located in the European Union whenever you collect data from them.\nThe notice that you provide needs to identify the legal basis (or \u201clawful basis\u201d, i.e., legitimate reason) applicable to your processing of personal data, including any data processed via Olark.\nArticle 6 of the GDPR lists six such legal bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public tasks, and legitimate interest.\nAs a data processor, Olark does not and cannot determine the legal basis for processing visitor personal data on behalf of its customers;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nHow will Olark help me respond to individual rights requests (e.g., right to access, correction, erasure, etc.)?\n<p>Olark has tools in place to help you export, modify and delete files.\nWe will continue to build out tools to help you respond to individual rights requests as our products and services expand and evolve.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Additional context:</em> One of the changes under the GDPR is the expansion of privacy rights for individuals located in the EU.\nAs a data controller, you will need to be ready and able to comply with applicable individual rights requests, such as deleting a customer\u2019s personal data from your records or providing them with a copy of the data you hold.\nThe GDPR grants some exceptions to compliance with individual requests.\nconsult with a legal expert to determine whether you are covered under an exception.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nDo I need customer consent to use personal data obtained through Olark?\n<p>If none of the other legal bases apply to your data usage, you will need to obtain specific, informed, freely given, and unambiguous consent to use your customers\u2019 data in the way you intend.\nNote that an \u201copt-out\u201d, where the customer is opted in to data usage by default, may no longer be sufficient.</p>\n<p>Consent is most often required for marketing uses (e.g., using an email address to send a customer promotional emails), but may be required for other uses, too.\nBe sure to ask your legal counsel to check the e-Privacy Directive (and once finalized, the e-Privacy Regulation) for additional e-marketing requirements.</p>\nCan I get customer consent in the chat box?\n<p>Yes.\nWe have tools to add a consent option to your chat box.</p>\n<p>It remains your responsibility to verify that your use of customer data is consistent with the consent given.</p>\nDo I have to delete all my transcripts from Olark to be compliant?\n<p>Not necessarily! If you received an individual rights request for erasure, you should consult with your legal counsel to determine how to respond.\nHowever, outside of an individual rights request, your obligation depends on how you use or process transcript data and which legal basis applies to such processing.</p>\n<p>You may be able to continue using transcripts if your legal basis for processing transcript data still applies.\nFor example, you may continue to use transcript data because you have a legal obligation to retain the data, if processing the data is in your website visitors\u2019 legitimate interest, or if your use of transcript data is directly related to performance of a contract or to steps a customer has requested you take prior to entering into a contract.</p>\n<p>Finally, you may be able to fulfill your GDPR obligations by refraining from certain uses of transcript data.</p>\n<p>Olark also provides privacy tools that allow you to redact certain visitor information from transcripts after a certain amount of time, or at a particular customer\u2019s request.\nThese privacy tools will destroy all form submissions (e.g., responses to pre-chat name, email, and phone fields).\nall text that is formatted as an email address, phone number, or IP address.\nand the visitor\u2019s internal ID.\nThis information is replaced with <code>&lt;redacted&gt;</code> in the transcript .\nRedaction also destroys all visitor files uploaded through the chatbox.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Again, you should consult with your legal counsel to identify the best option for your company.\nTranscript data cannot be restored once deleted, so if transcript data is valuable to your business, we encourage you to explore the possibility of modifying or limiting your use of transcripts rather than deleting the data entirely.</p>\nDo you have an updated privacy policy?\n<p>Yes! We have updated our privacy policy to help you better understand how we handle customer data and protect your privacy.\nYou can find our updated policy here.</p>\nPrivacy Shield was invalidated in the EU - what next?\n<p>We have updated our DPA to reflect these changes and would be happy to send you a new DPA for signing.\nPlease reach out to us directly with that request.</p>\nWhat tools do you offer to help us control data retention?\n<p>We offer a number of tools in our data management dashboard.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You can choose to automatically redact certain visitor information from all transcripts after a specified time period.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can redact certain information for a single visitor, based on the visitor\u2019s email address, if that visitor submits a request for erasure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can export all transcripts associated with a visitor\u2019s email address, along with other information about that visitor, to a CSV file.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can add a custom consent request and agreement checkbox to the chat box.\nWhen a visitor grants or withdraws consent via the checkbox, their action will be noted in the chat transcript.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nDoes Olark have a signed DPA with each sub-processor?\n<p>Yes, we have a signed DPA with all of the vendors we use to process personal data.</p> ",
