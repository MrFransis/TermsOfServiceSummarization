customers.\nWhen you share your personal information with us on our online channels, we\u2019ll process your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>As we\u2019re a global company that sells

survey providers, product catalogue providers and customer service suppliers to deliver services on our behalf.\nWe have contracts with the companies to make sure they only use your personal information for agreed services and meet legal requirements;</li>\n<li>When we store your information using secure cloud storage services/facilities.\nWe have contracts with companies to make sure they only use your personal information for the agreed services and meet legal requirements;</li>\n<li>If a merger, acquisition or sale of assets ever meant we needed to share information with a third party - in this case we\u2019d email you and post a notice on our website to publish the change of owner and we\u2019d also tell you how your data would be used and give you options regarding your personal data;</li>\n<li>When you\u2019ve given us permission to share your information with third parties so they can send you information on their products and promotions (you can opt out of these emails by contacting our LEGO Customer Service team although in some cases you may also need to contact the third-party directly);</li>\n<li>When you have given us permission to share your information with third parties, so they can provide you with marketing information and promotions regarding our products (as an example personalized advertising provided via a social media platform).\nYou can opt

settings and request deletion of collected information by the third-party site)</li>\n<li>When you\u2019ve asked us to share your personal information with third-party sites or platforms like social networking sites \u2013 once it\u2019s been shared, your personal data will be processed by that third-party according to their own privacy processes</li>\n</ul>How long do we keep your personal information<p>We\u2019ll keep your personal information as long as your account is active or as long as it\u2019s needed to provide a service.\nWe have so called retention polices for each of the categories of personal information that we process.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to cancel your account or for us to delete your data, we\u2019ll only keep information that we need for legal reasons, to resolve disputes or to enforce our agreements.</p>Our Cookie Policy<p>Cookies are small data files that your browser places on your computer or device.\nA cookie itself does not contain or collect information.\nHowever, when it is read by a server via a web browser it can help a website deliver a more user-friendly service \u2013 for example, remembering previous purchases or account details.</p>\n<p>Like most websites, our online channels and our applications (apps) collect some information (e.g.\ninformation on IP addresses, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps and clickstream data).\nThis information won\u2019t be linked to any other information we collect about you unless you have given your consent that we may do this.</p>\n<p>Both we and our third-party tracking utility partners use browser storage, app storage, cookies, pixls, beacons, scripts and tags to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement through the site and collect demographic information about our overall user base.\nWe may receive reports on these from our third-party tracking utility partners on an individual and aggregate basis.\nFor more information about cookies, please read our full Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Keeping children safe online<p>We care deeply about making sure children are safe online and have extra privacy processes in place to make sure we\u2019re keeping our younger fans safe when they\u2019re using our online channels.\nIn fact, some features have age gates so to prevent children from inadvertently using such features.\nWe also take all reasonable care to secure that we don\u2019t knowingly collect, store, use or process personal information from children who may use those features without proper parental consent.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve joined a digital child safety program which audits our company on a yearly basis to make sure we follow the rules in the way interact with children online.</p>\n<p>We also follow all relevant laws for children aged between 13 and 18 and when it comes to personal data, we consider anyone under the age of 16 years a child</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy.officer@lego.com.</p>\n<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\nTo view a list of properties covered by our Dispute Resolution provider, please click the seal located at the top of this section.</p>\n<p>When we do process personal information from children, we take extra steps to protect their privacy including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making sure we tell parents what personal information we collect, store, use and process from their child and explaining whether we share the information</li>\n<li>Meeting legal requirements by asking for parental consent to collect, use and process a child\u2019s data and asking for consent to send their children information about our products and services</li>\n<li>Limiting how we collect, store, use and process personal information from children so only data that is reasonably needed for them to take part in an online activity is collected</li>\n<li>Giving parents access or the option to ask for access to personal information we\u2019ve collected from their child \u2013 parents can also ask for their children\u2019s personal information to be changed or deleted</li>\n</ul>Collecting and using children\u2019s information<p>While some of our websites, channels and apps are designed with families and users of all ages in mind, others are intended to be used mainly by children.\nWhenever we collect personal information from a child, we only keep the information for the time we need it to provide a service or for the time it\u2019s legally required to be kept on record.</p>\n<p>While children can choose whether to share their information with us, there are features of our websites that won\u2019t function if they haven\u2019t given us their information.\nWhere personal information is needed for features to function, we\u2019ll only ask for information that is reasonably required to take part in the activity.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of times when we collect children\u2019s data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When children register online<p>Children can register on our websites to access a variety of services including content, games and competitions.\nDuring registration, we may ask a child to provide their parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s email address, the child\u2019s first name, gender, their birth date, their username and password.\nWe use this information for security and notification reasons.\nWe strongly encourage children to create a username that excludes any personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When children share content they\u2019ve created themselves<p>Some of our websites allow children to create or use content themselves.\nSince only some of these features require personal information from the child, not all activities require consent from a parent or guardian.\nWhenever an activity could potentially allow a child to share personal information, we either review the content ourselves and make sure personal information is removed or ask for permission from a parent or guardian to collect the data.\nTypes of personal data that children have shared with us in the past include stories, free-text fields, drawings that allow text or free-hand entry of information, photographs of your child, sound clips, movie files or any type of content or other persistent identifiers that clearly identifies the child in some way.\nIf, as well as collecting content that includes personal information, we also plan to share the content publicly or with a third party for their own use, we\u2019ll ask the parent or guardian for \u2018verifiable parental consent\u2019 (which is a higher level of parental consent).</p>\n</li>\n<li>When children enter contests and sweepstakes<p>If a child wants to enter a competition, we ask for the personal information we need for a child to take part.\nWe usually only ask for the child\u2019s first name (so we can tell the difference between children from the same family) and the email address of a parent or guardian (so we meet legal requirements to notify the responsible adult).\nWe\u2019ll only contact the parent if the child wins the contest or sweepstake to find out where to send the prize.\nIf the competition asks the child to create content to enter, we may need to ask for parental consent by email in advance to ensure we meet the privacy requirements for content children have created themselves (please see the information above about children creating content).\nWithout consent, children won\u2019t be able to take part in our competitions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When children receive emails from us<p>We may need ask for their child\u2019s contact details (including their email address) so that we can reply to a question they\u2019ve asked us.\nTo meet legislative requirements around the world, we\u2019ll delete any information we have on the child as soon as the reply\u2019s been sent.\nIf we need to get in touch with the child a second time, for example to reply to additional questions, we would request an email address from their parent or guardian.\nWe\u2019d then only keep the child\u2019s online contact information for the time it takes us to honor their request and wouldn\u2019t use the information for any other purpose.\nIf we ever need a child\u2019s online contact information for ongoing communication, we\u2019d ask for the parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s email address at the earliest opportunity so that we can keep the adult informed of the data we\u2019re collecting and to give the parent an option to ask us to stop collecting data.\nParents or guardians can opt out of any communication we have with their child at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions within each communication (if there is more than one type of communication, the adult may need to opt out of each individually).\nAlternatively, they can contact our LEGO Customer Service team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When children receive app push notifications<p>Many apps send users \u2018push notifications\u2019 to their customers\u2019 mobile phones or devices to tell them about updates (sometimes even when the app is not in use).\nSome of our apps are designed to be used by children.\nWe ask children to provide the email address of their parent or guardian, so we can tell the adult about their child\u2019s request before we send children push notifications from our apps.\nWe don\u2019t link the device identifier with any other personal information without parental consent.\nIf you would like your child to stop receiving push notifications from one of apps, you can change the settings on the device your child\u2019s using at any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When we collect location information<p>Some of our websites, channels and apps are designed for children.\nWe request consent from a parent or guardian by email before collecting information on a child\u2019s street name, address or coordinates.\nWe do that because such information will effectively make us able to identify a specific child.\nAs an opposite, we don\u2019t require parental consent to collect information on a child\u2019s city, country or region as long as it isn\u2019t linked directly to the specific child.\nThe reason for this, is that such generic information will not make us able to identify a specific child.\nIf you would like to stop us collecting this type of location information, you can adjust the settings on the device your child is using at any time.\nAlternatively, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When we collect \u2018persistent identifiers\u2019<p>So we can give visitors to our online channels more relevant and personalized online experiences, we automatically collect some types on information (e.g.\ninformation on IP addresses, mobile device identifier, browsers, internet service providers, referring pages, exit pages, visitor frequency, operating systems, date stamps, time stamps and clickstream data).\nWe collect this information using technologies such as cookies, pixels, flash cookies, web beacons and other unique identifiers (which we define under the Cookie Policy section of this Privacy Policy).\nWe may collect this information ourselves or ask a third party to process the data on our behalf.\nWe use this data to give children access to online features and activities, to customize content, to improve our online channels, to analyze the performance of our online channel and to create anonymous reports.\nIf we ever want to collect children\u2019s data for any other reason, we would contact the child\u2019s parent or guardian for consent in advance.\nA list of third-party operators who collect \u2018persistent identifiers\u2019 on our sites and apps can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>What if we accidentally collect children\u2019s data?<p>If we discover that we\u2019ve unintentionally collected information from a child in a way that doesn\u2019t meet COPPA requirements, we will delete the information immediately.</p>Requesting parental consent<p>Asking for low-level consent by email<br>If we need to collect a child\u2019s personal information, we\u2019ll ask for parental consent according to COPPA legal requirements.\nWe\u2019ll send the child\u2019s parent or guardian an email explaining what information we\u2019re collecting, how we plan to use it and ask the parent to give or deny their consent.\nIf we don\u2019t receive parental consent in a reasonable time, we\u2019ll delete all information we\u2019ve collected from the child including the adult\u2019s contact information that we asked for in order to request consent.</p>Asking for high-level \u2018verifiable consent<p>If we want to share a child\u2019s personal information publicly or with a third party, we\u2019ll seek a higher level of parental consent than the email request described above.\nWe may ask for verification by credit card or other payment method (with a nominal charge involved), verification over the phone or through a video chat to a trained customer service representative or a signed consent form to be returned to us by mail, email attachment or fax.\nWe may give the parent a guardian a PIN or password that they\u2019ll be able to use in future communications to confirm the adult\u2019s identity.</p>What if a parent or guardian hasn\u2019t been contacted for consent?<p>If a child under the age of 16 accesses an online channel that\u2019s designed for children by using an age gate, we\u2019ll email the child\u2019s parent or guardian before collecting any personal information from the child.\nIf you think that your child is taking part in an online activity that collects their personal information and you or another parent/guardian hasn\u2019t received an email letting you know or seeking your consent, please contact our Data Privacy Officer at privacy.officer@lego.com.\nWe won\u2019t use email addresses provided for parental consent for any other purpose unless the adult has expressly opted in to marketing emails or taken part in an activity which allows email contact.</p>Parental choices and controls<p>At any time, parents or guardians can refuse to allow us to use and collect further personal information from their child.\nParents or guardians can ask us to delete the personal information we have collected in connection with their child\u2019s account from our records.\nAs personal information is required for some services, deleting a child\u2019s records may result in an account, membership, or service being unavailable to the child in future.</p>\n<p>If a child has a registered LEGO ID, parents or guardians can access, change or delete the personal information we\u2019ve collected from their child by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using their child\u2019s username and password to log into their child\u2019s LEGO ID account</li>\n<li>Getting in touch with our LEGO Customer Service team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019d prefer to contact us, please let us know your child\u2019s username along with the your own telephone number and email address.\nWe\u2019ll need to confirm your identity as the parent or guardian of the child before granting access to the child\u2019s personal information.\nWe will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<p>If we make material changes to how we use Personal Information collected from a child under the age of 16, we\u2019ll tell their parent or guardian by email and ask for \u2018verifiable parental consent\u2019 for the new uses of the child\u2019s personal information.</p>Sharing information we have consent to share with others<p>If we\u2019ve received high-level parental consent to share a child\u2019s personal information publicly, we may also share personal information with our service provides or legal authorities.\nWe may share information with our service providers including software solution companies, online security partners and customer services.\nOur contracts with these companies make sure they only use personal data for the agreed purpose.</p>\n<p>We may share personal information to meet legal processes or if disclosure is required by law.\nAs allowed by relevant laws, we may also share personal information collected from children to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with a request from to a law enforcement or public agency (including schools or children services) or to avoid liability</li>\n<li>Make a disclosure that we believe may stop a crime being committed</li>\n<li>Help an investigation related to public safety</li>\n<li>Protect the safety of a child who\u2019s using our online channels</li>\n<li>Protect the technology of our service providers or security of our online channels themselves</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Parents have the right to consent to the collection, use and processing of their child\u2019s personal information without also having to consent to the disclosure of that information to third parties.\nWe don\u2019t share information with third parties other than as described above.</p>Our employees<p>Whether you\u2019re an existing employee or applying for a job with us, we\u2019ll process specific information relevant for your employment and application.\nThe principles in this Privacy Policy will also apply to your employment and application.</p>LEGO Partners<p>We define LEGO Partners as other companies doing business with the LEGO Group.\nWe process information on our LEGO Partner companies for collaboration and evaluation purposes.</p>Data security and integrity<p>The security, integrity and confidentiality of customer information is extremely important to us.\nWe use technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification.\nAll external transfers that contain personal information are done using encrypted technology.\nCredit card information is handled by approved service providers that meet PCI (Payment Card Industry) standards and have appropriate safeguards in place.<br>Although we regularly review our security procedures and evaluate new technology and methods to make our online channels safer, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.</p>\n<p>Our customers, employees and partners also play an important role in protecting information.\nWe encourage customers to choose passwords that are difficult for others to guess and to keep their personal passwords secret.</p>\n<p>Should you notice any flaws or concerns in our security, please contact our LEGO Customer Service team as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>If we ever experience a data breach in which customer information is at risk of being misused, we\u2019ll contact customers according to legal requirements.\nIf necessary, we\u2019ll also contact data protection authorities.</p>Data transfers, storage and processing globally<p>As we\u2019re a global company, we may transfer your personal information to individual subsidiaries of the LEGO Group or third parties in locations around the world for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nWhenever your personal information is transferred, stored or processed by us or by companies carrying out such services on our behalf, we\u2019ll take reasonable steps to safeguard the privacy of your personal information.\nAdditionally, when using or disclosing personal information we abide by our Binding Corporate Rules, when these become effective.</p>\n<p>The Binding Corporate Rules provide the highest security to you when it comes to how your information is processed.</p>Binding Corporate Rules and local legal requirements<p>We want to make sure we as a minimum use the standards of data privacy and security that follows from the European General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) anywhere in the
