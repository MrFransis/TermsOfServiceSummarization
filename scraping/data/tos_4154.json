a responsibility we take seriously, so we encourage you to review our Website Privacy Policy.\n<strong>This Website Privacy Policy does not apply to any products or services we have, or to the operation of the ClassDojo Service and associated software, including in logged-in areas of our website as well as the ClassDojo application (collectively the \u201cService\u201d), which is covered by a separate policy.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Website Privacy Policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles.\nWe\u2019ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you\u2019re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first.</p>\n<p>This ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy (the \u201cWebsite Privacy Policy\u201d) covers information that ClassDojo, Inc.\n(\u201cClassDojo\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, or \u201cus\u201d) collects from users and visitors of websites operated and controlled by ClassDojo that link to this Website Privacy Policy, including https://www.classdojo.com (referred to collectively as the \u201cSites\u201d).\nPlease see our ClassDojo Products Privacy Policy for information on our privacy practices as they relate to our ClassDojo Service.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>\n<li>How we use that information.</li>\n<li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By accessing or using the Sites, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of your information as described below.\nIf you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on the Sites or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Sites.</p> Types of Information We Collect\n<p>On our corporate website, we collect two types of information about you: (1) information that you may choose to voluntarily provide us while using the Site (described below under \u201cInformation You Provide to Us\u201d [LINK to section below] and (2) information collected automatically as a result of your use of the Site (described below under \u201cInformation Collected Automatically\u201d[LINK to section below]).\nWe may also receive information about you from third-party sources as described below under \u201cInformation Received from Third-Party Sources\u201d [LINK to section below].</p>\nInformation You Provide to Us\n<p>You may choose to voluntarily provide certain personal information to us \u2014 such as name, telephone number, or email address in order to access certain features of our Site or request information from us.\nFor example, the Site allows you to request information about the ClassDojo product.\nregister for special events.\nparticipate in surveys and contests.\nand to submit an application for employment.\nTo support these activities, ClassDojo will ask for information about you and / or the company for which you work.</p>\n<p>When you send us a message using the \"Contact Us\" page or via email, we retain the content of the message, your email address, and any information you provide to us such as your name, phone number, your company, experience with our service, your contact preferences, and the response we send back to you.\nThis helps us manage any follow-up questions you may have, measure how effectively we address your concerns and improve the Site.\nAny information retained would be used to assure the delivery of the services or information you requested and to optimize your experience and enhance the quality of the time you spend with us online.\nWhen you send us a message using the \"Contact Us\" page or via email, the email addresses and phone numbers collected are not further used to market to the individual beyond providing the services requested or responding to the requests.</p>\n<p>This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Site, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations.\nWithout it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services.</p>\nInformation Collected Automatically\n<p>To provide a personalized and high-quality experience for our users, we (or our service providers) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information from your browser or your device when you use the Site, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us.\nThis information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Site.\nFor example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to the Site (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).\nIf you visit the Site on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent service across your different devices or to provide you relevant ClassDojo advertisements.\nIf we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>The technologies and information we automatically collect include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and other similar technologies:</strong> We (or our <strong>service providers</strong>) may use cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device.\nWe (or our service providers) may also use these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our user base, track your movements around the Site, administer the Site, tailor the Site for you, and to help the Site work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.\nWe (or our service providers) also may use these technologies (never in student logged-in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Services that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Site, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site).\nFor more information see the \u201cOnline Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track\u201d section below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Local storage:</strong> We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage, including HTTP cookies and HTML5, and application data caches or plug-in based local storage such as Flash Cookies.\nLike many services, ClassDojo uses these technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information, understand your engagement with the Sites, administer the Sites, tailor the Sites for you, and to help the Sites work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.\nThird-parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based on your web browsing also may use HTML5 or other local storage to collect and store information.\nPlease read our <strong>Online Tracking Technologies Policy</strong> for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device Information</strong>: We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and unique device identifiers.\nThis helps us measure how Sites are performing and improve the Sites for you on your particular device.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>: When you use our Site, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through IP address, GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.\nWe collect coarse (i.e., city-level) location data.\nWe never collect precise geolocation data from students using our Service.\nWe will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.\nWe do not share precise geolocation data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Site.\nIf you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Server Log Information</strong>: Like most online services, when you use our Site, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server log files.\nExamples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Site, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Site</li>\n<li>IP Address</li>\n<li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least) popular.\nWe may use your IP address and share it with third-parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Site, to enhance the Site and services based on usage pattern data, for analytics and for advertising.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cross-Device Collection</strong>: To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using to provide a seamless experience across multiple devices and browsers without collecting or processing any additional identifying personal data.</li>\n</ul>\nInformation Received from Third-Party Sources\n<p>We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically.\nThis may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us.\nIf we receive personal information from third-parties we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nIf we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect on the Site, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nAdditionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading \u201cAggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information\u201d.\nLocal law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.\nWe do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.</p>\nHow We Use the Information We Collect\n<p>We use information, including personal information, collected through our Site for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including as set forth above under \u201cInformation Collected Automatically\u201d.\nIn addition, we may use the information, including personal information,

the Online Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track section below);</li>\n<li>For any other purpose for which the information was collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about how we use your information for personalization and tracking, including advertising, please see our Online Tracking Technologies Policy.\nWe process this information given our legitimate interest in improving the Sites and our users\u2019 experience with it, in protecting the Site, where necessary for the adequate performance of the contract with you, and to comply with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will process your personal information for the purposes listed in this section related to marketing given our legitimate interests in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest.\nYou can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your notification settings within your ClassDojo account.</p>\n<p>Please note that we may anonymize and/or de-identify information collected through the Sites or via other means so that the

Features and here for more information on third-party services.\nPlease see here for a list of third-party app integrations on our Site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers</strong>: We work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Site and other services by performing tasks on our behalf.\nThese service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d).\nWe may need to securely share or provide information, including personal information, to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, providing surveys, assisting with employment applications, and security.\nWe may also authorize these third-party companies to collect information on our behalf.\nThese providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed.\nAdditionally, these partners and service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nPlease see here for a list of the third parties we work with to provide the Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics Services</strong>: To help us better understand your use of the Sites, we may use third-party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics.\nYou can find out more about Google's position on privacy as regards its analytics service at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.\nThese third-parties use the type of technologies described in the \u201cAutomatically Collected Information\u201d section above.\nThese services

located here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Partners:</strong> From time to time, ClassDojo may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services.\nIf you purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly-offered product or service from ClassDojo, we may share information collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our joint promotion partner(s).\nClassDojo does not control our business partners\u2019 use of the information we collect, and their use of the information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies.\nIf you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to purchase or specifically express interest in a jointly offered product or service.\nClassDojo does not share information with business partners unless you specifically opt-in to such sharing.\nIf you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to opt-in.\nIf you choose to share your information with business partners in the manners described above, your information will be subject to the business partners\u2019 respective privacy statements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media Platforms:</strong> Where permissible according to applicable law, we may share certain limited personal information with social media platforms (such as Google or Facebook) and other websites, applications or partners, to generate leads, drive traffic to our Sites or otherwise market and advertise our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students).\nThese processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest.\nThese social media platforms with which we may share your personal information are not controlled or supervised by ClassDojo.\nTherefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform processes your personal information should be directed to such a provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong>: We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other de-identified or non-personally identifiable information (such as statistics about visitors, traffic and usage patterns), including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how the Site is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo.\nAny aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose information, including personal information, if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.\nWe may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.\nThis includes, without limitation, responding to law enforcement and government requests.\nWhere appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law.\n(ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon ClassDojo, or its users.\nIn instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fraud and Security Protection:</strong> We may share the information to assist with security operations for scheduled penetration testing, auditing, and continuous improvement of our security practices, including without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.\nAuthorized parties of the information would comply with our

ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, or in any other situation where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party, we may disclose, share or transfer the information.\nThis Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).\nWe will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.\nWe may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (or their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With your consent</strong>: Other than the cases above, we won\u2019t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it.\nAdditionally, as discussed above, we will never sell your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.</p>\nOnline Analytics, Advertising and Do-Not-Track\nOnline Analytics Providers\n<p>We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics, to help us measure website traffic and usage trends for the Sites and to understand more about the demographics of our users.\nYou can learn more about Google\u2019s practices here, and view its currently available opt-out options.\nThese third-parties use technologies described in the \u201cAutomatically Collected Information\u201d section above.\nThe information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.\nA current list of analytics providers that we use is located here.</p>\nAdvertising Technology Providers\n<p>Data about your activities on our Sites may be collected by us or by advertising technology providers for use in delivering online advertising tailored to your individual characteristics, activities, interests and other factors.\nThese ad services may track your online activities over time and across the web by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of the various technologies described above, and they may use this information, and other information they receive from us or other sources, to deliver advertisements to you on our website, our emails, and other websites.\nWe and third-party vendors may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together, and other automated technologies, and in some cases additional information, (i) to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Sites or other factors and (ii) to report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Sites or other factors.\n</p>\n<p>You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out page to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising based on your Internet browsing activities from companies that participate in those programs.\nSome of our advertising-related activities may involve the services of companies that do not participate in those programs.\nFor example, we may use the Google AdWords remarketing service to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our Website.\nYou can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page.\nThe opt-outs apply only to the browser in which you set them.\nFor example, if you set the opt-out while using Firefox, but then use Chrome, the opt-out will not be active in Chrome.\nTo opt-out in Chrome, you will need to repeat the opt-out process.</p>\n<p>The opt-outs described in this Privacy Policy do not block or delete cookies, or prevent the use of cookies or other technologies for purposes other than selecting ads based on your interests as inferred by your online behavior.\nIf you opt-out, data may still be collected about your web browsing activities and you will still see advertising.\nAds may be delivered based on other factors, such as the content of the web page in which they are shown, or demographic information obtained through other means.</p>\n<p>Please read our Online Tracking Technologies Policy for more details, including how to remove or modify your cookie settings and a list of the advertising tracking technologies we use.</p>\nDo Not Track Disclosure\n<p>Do Not Track (\"DNT\") is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nHowever, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT.\nFor more information on \u201cdo not track\u201d, please visit www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>\nData Security and Retention\n<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.\nTo prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or improper use of your information, and to maintain data accuracy, we\u2019ve established physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect the personal information we collect.\nAlthough we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can\u2019t guarantee the security of information.\nOutages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>\n<p>If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nfor example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Site, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us.\nDepending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>\n<p>We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\nClassDojo\u2019s Commitments to Providing Transparency and Your Rights\n<p>As you can see, we try to be transparent about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.\n<em>You control the personal information you share with us.</em> You can access or rectify this information at any time.\nYou can also delete your account (if you have created one) or your personal information.\nWe also provide you tools to object, restrict, or withdraw consent where applicable for the use of personal information you have provided to ClassDojo.</p>\n<p>You may exercise any of these rights described in this section by sending an email to privacy@classdojo.com or making a request here.\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking further action on your request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access, correct or delete your personal information</li>\n<li>Object, restrict, or withdraw consent;</li>\n<li>Take information out of ClassDojo</li>\n</ul>\nAccess, Correct or Delete Your Personal Information\n<p>ClassDojo aims to provide you with easy access to any personal information we have collected about you and give you easy ways to update it or delete it, unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business purposes (e.g., we need at least an email address for your account if you maintain an account with us) or legal purposes.\nYou have the right to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information concerning you.</p>\n<p>You have a right to request access to all your personal information we have on file by emailing us at privacy@classdojo.com or by following the instructions here.\nIn some cases, we won\u2019t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.</p>\n<p>You may, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com.\nWhen updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.\nMore detail on how we will verify you is set forth here.\nYou may also exercise your control or choices with the communications we send you as set forth in \u201cCommunications from ClassDojo\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.\nBecause of this, even after you update or delete personal information you have provided us from our Service, your personal information may be retained in our backup files and archives for a reasonable period of time as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety.\nIf you are a California resident, we may also retain personal information as set forth under the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nPlease see our FAQ for more information if you are a California resident.</p>\n<p>We may reject requests for access, change or deletion that are unreasonably repetitive (more than 2 times per year for access requests), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).\nIn some cases, we won\u2019t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.</p>\n<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort or if more than two (2) times a year for access requests.</p>\nObject, Restrict, or Withdraw Consent\n<p>Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by ClassDojo you may

past versions of this policy here on Github.</p>\n<p>We believe you should always know what data we collect from you and how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both.\nWe want to empower users to make the best decisions about the information that they share with us.\nIn fact, we made a short video for students that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about.\nWe also have a Student Data Protection Addendum, an agreement we enter into with schools, that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to Student Data that we collect or receive.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the ClassDojo Services (defined below) and does not apply to the informational website located at https://www.classdojo.com (the \u201cClassDojo Website\u201d).\nThe ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy is located here.</p>\n<p>You should read this policy in full, but here are a few key points:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Data We Collect</strong>: Please see this page for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.\nAdditionally, please review this chart for more detail on our mobile app permission and our Online Tracking Technologies Policy.\nYou can also find more details below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong>: We use the personal information we collect from students (or about students from teachers) to provide and improve the Service, for educational purposes, security, and safety purposes, or as required by law.\nWe will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service.\nSee here for more information on our use of information collected from students, and children using the service not connected to a school (\u201cOutside School Child User\u201d), and here for additional information on our use of information collected from teachers, parents, and school leaders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention</strong>: We will not retain student personal information for any longer than is necessary for educational purposes and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information.\nAdditionally, we protect students with our industry-leading 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we collect only minimal information from students necessary to register for the Service, (2) we automatically delete their feedback points awarded in school after a year, and (3) we delete Students\u2019 Accounts if they\u2019re inactive for more than twelve months.\nNote, however, some content within a Student Account will be kept after deletion of the account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of \u201ceducation records\u201d under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or \u201cStudent Data\u201d under state student privacy laws) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school.\nWe store non-student user personal information, including content uploaded by Outside School Child Users, for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Service to you and others.\nFor non-student users (as well as Outside School Child Users), personal information associated with your account will be kept until your account is deleted or until we no longer need the data to provide the Service, whichever occurs first.\nNote, however, that some content uploaded by a teacher, school leader, or parent may also be kept after the deletion of the account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of \u201ceducation records\u201d under FERPA or \u201cStudent Data\u201d under state student privacy laws) and will not be deleted until we receive direction from the school.\nSee here for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What Student Information is Shown Publicly?</strong> No student\u2019s account, or Outside School Child User\u2019s account (\u201cOutside School Child Account\u201d), profile, or portfolio is made available or visible to the public through ClassDojo.\nOnly the student, the student\u2019s parents, and the student\u2019s teachers or school leaders can see the student\u2019s (or Outside School Child User\u2019s) profile and portfolio.\nNo child can upload content (such as a response to an activity, photo, video, drawing, journal entry, or document) to the Service on Portfolios except through their account.\nThis can\u2019t happen for children without either (1) the parent providing parental consent directly to ClassDojo or (2) the child\u2019s teacher representing to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent, including acting as the agent of the parent if their school policy allows.\nAdditionally, the student\u2019s teacher must approve any post made by students in their Student Account (as defined below), before it is shared with parents on the student\u2019s portfolio.\nParents are able to view their own child\u2019s portfolio, including any Portfolio Comments (as defined below), on their own parent account after the teacher has approved the student-submitted content.\nParents may see feedback points awarded in school if the teacher has elected to let parents see these.\nParents may also award points, goals and rewards for educational and other learning activities at home through certain premium features, such as ClassDojo Beyond School \u201cPremium Features\u201d that are only viewable by the child and the child\u2019s parent(s), or those that the parent allows access to.</p>\n<p>Class Story and School Story are visible by students, teachers, parents, and school leaders who have logged into their accounts and are associated with that particular class or school.\nThey are not viewable by the general public.\nParents, teachers and school leaders can add content or comments to these stories, but students can only view or like content on these stories and are only able to do this once either the school or ClassDojo has obtained parental consent, if under 13.\nIf any user needs to report any abuse or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at privacy@classdojo.com.\nTeachers may share their classes, including feedback points, Portfolios, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school.\nContent uploaded or feedback points awarded within Premium Features is viewable only by the parent and the children accessing such Premium Features on the parent\u2019s device or the child\u2019s device.\nthe content is not viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students.\nPlease see here for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We Never Sell Personal Information</strong>: We will never sell or rent your personal information or non-personal information.\nWe will only share or disclose personal information with a limited set of third-party service providers necessary to provide or develop our Services (such as database hosting) or as required by law, and we will be transparent about who these service providers are.\nWe will contractually require that these service providers process personal information in accordance with our instructions and consistent with this Privacy Policy and ensure that these service providers employ reasonable and comprehensive data protection and security protocols.\nSee here for more details.\nAdditionally, we make very clear commitments (consistent with our obligations under the Student Privacy Pledge) regarding how we handle data in the event of a change to our organization (such as merger) where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred or acquired.\nConsistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Privacy Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).\nPlease see here for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You own your data</strong>: We don\u2019t own any content or information you provide or we receive - you (students, parents and/or schools) will own your content and information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security and Privacy by Design and Default</strong>: We use security industry best practices to protect personal information, including using encryption and other security safeguards to protect personal information.\nWe design products with security and privacy in mind from day one.\nSee here for more information as well as our Security Whitepaper and Privacy Center.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Transparency and Choice</strong>: We will be transparent about our practices, so that you can make meaningful choices about how your personal information is used.\nIf we make a material change, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on our service or this website page and/or we will notify you by email (if you have provided an email address to us).\nSee here for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to Access, Correction, and Deletion of Data</strong>: We support access to, correction, and deletion of student personal information by the student or their parent or legal guardian, either by 1) assisting the school in meeting its requirements for access, correction and deletion or by responding to requests we receive from schools, or 2) directly responding to requests from parents when the information is collected directly from a child and ClassDojo obtains the parent consent (not the school) - such as when they are using our Premium Features or Outside School Child Account.\nTeachers, parents, school leaders and other users can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com from the email used to create your account or here once you are signed into your account to access, correct or update their personal information, or they can use the features in their account settings to do so.\nSee here for more information on all user\u2019s rights, including about your additional rights of data portability and right to object or withdrawal consent.</p> ClassDojo Privacy Policy\n<p>Last updated: December 30, 2019</p>\n<p>ClassDojo\u2019s mission is to give teachers, school leaders, parents, and students the

that ClassDojo doesn\u2019t own or control, such as third-party services you might access through links or other features (e.g., social media buttons or YouTube videos) on the Service.\nThese other

for having policies and practices that are compliant with the federal mandates for FERPA.</p>\n<p>ClassDojo is also a signatory to the Student Privacy Pledge, agreeing to a set of principles intended to safeguard student privacy, including responsible stewardship, protection, and transparent handling of student personal information.\nRead more about the Student Privacy Pledge here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>ClassDojo is certified COPPA-compliant, has a certification stating that its policies and practices help schools meet their FERPA obligations, and has also signed the Student Privacy Pledge.</p>\n</blockquote> What is ClassDojo?\n<p>ClassDojo is a school communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents.\nTeachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or \u201cfeedback points\u201d) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership.\nTeachers can also post assignments using the Activities feature for students to complete on ClassDojo (\u201cActivities\u201d).\nThey use the ClassDojo Apps or the ClassDojo Platform - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other.\nTeachers instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, and also add posts to Class Story and School Story - a private feed of moments from the classroom and school that only students, parents, \u201cverified teachers,\u201d and school leaders can see.\nTeachers may also add posts to individual Portfolios - a private portfolio of content that only the student, their teachers, school leaders, and the student\u2019s parents can see.</p>\n<p>Parents get to be a part of their child\u2019s classroom experiences, and those parents may optionally purchase Premium Features to help encourage their children at home.\nParents access and set up an account on ClassDojo using a unique parent code provided by their child\u2019s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique parent code, or by choosing their child\u2019s teacher from within the list shown within ClassDojo App or ClassDojo Website (the request to join the class must still be approved by the teacher).\nParents can only view their own children\u2019s feedback points (if elected to be shown by their child\u2019s teacher) and Portfolios, not those of any other students.\nParents can also set up an account without using a unique parent code, but the account will not be connected to their child\u2019s school (or any activity on their child\u2019s account in school), but they can also purchase Premium Features.</p>\n<p>Students can have their own account to view feedback given by teachers and parents, and perform additional tasks, such as adding photos and videos of classwork to Portfolios, writing journal entries, creating drawings, responding to their teacher\u2019s comments on their portfolio (teacher and student comments collectively \u201cPortfolio Comments\u201d), submitting responses to Activities (\u201cStudent Activity Responses\u201d), and customizing their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo (\u201cStudent Account\u201d).\nIn order to have a Student Account created, students will need to either (1) have the Student Account created at school by their teacher (only after the teacher represents to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent) which allows them to then login (such as through the use of a QR code, class text code, or Google Login (as defined below)).\nor (2) receive a unique code from their teacher to create their own account with a username and password (which will require parental consent).\nor (3) have their parents create their Student Account at home after we have obtained parental consent.\nAdditionally, a child\u2019s parent may create an Outside School Child Account for them to use at home for certain Premium Features.\nAny at-home feedback points and content uploaded are not viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students, but the customization of the monster through Premium Features may show up in the child\u2019s Student Account and viewable in school (e.g., by teachers, school leaders, and other students).</p>\n<p>School leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo.\nThey can share notes, photos, and videos on School Story.\nonly teachers, parents, and students connected to classes in the school can see these posts.\nSchool leaders can also create classes, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students, post to Class Story and Portfolios, add Portfolio Comments, message with parents, and see Highlights - a high-level overview of all the feedback and engagement happening within their school.</p>\n<p>More information on how the Service operates is located here and your participation and use of the Service is governed by our Terms of Service (\u201cTerms\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>ClassDojo is a school communication platform that brings teachers, students, parents together.\nLearn more here.</p>\n</blockquote> How does ClassDojo protect children\u2019s personal information?\n<p>Protecting children\u2019s privacy is especially important to us - we\u2019re educators and parents ourselves, after all.\nThis is why we\u2019ve signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received iKeepSafe\u2019s Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) Safe Harbor seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with iKeepSafe\u2019s COPPA Safe Harbor program.\nCOPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (\u201cchild\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d).\nfor more information about COPPA and generally protecting children\u2019s online privacy, please visit OnGuard Online.\nWe\u2019ve also made a short video for students that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about.\nWe also have a Student Data Protection Addendum, an agreement we enter into with schools, that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to Student Data that we collect or receive.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What information does ClassDojo collect from children, and how is it used?</strong>\nThe statements we make regarding the information we collect from or about students and children using ClassDojo through an Outside School Child Account , such as those using our Premium Features at home who may or may not be connected to a school and how we use this information applies equally to all students and Outside School Child Users regardless of their age.\nAccordingly, where this Privacy Policy references students or any information collected from or about students (including Outside School Child Users), our Privacy Policy applies to students under 13 years old as well as students 13 years old and above.\nPlease note, however, that for Outside School Child Users, we have different data retention policies as this information would not be retained beyond account deletion as may be required under FERPA or other state student privacy laws for \u201ceducation records\u201d or \u201c[Student Data]\u201d(https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca).</p>\n<p>ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students and Outside School Child Users necessary to register for an account on the Service.\nThis information is necessary to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service and for security and safety purposes.\nAdditionally, ClassDojo follows the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) COPPA rules for parental consent, including, where applicable, the use of which is commonly referred to a \u201cschool consent\u201d if a school or teacher elects to utilize ClassDojo in the classroom.\nFor more detail on the categories of personal information collected from students and Outside School Child Users, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the purposes for which the information was collected and the categories of third parties with whom we share such personal information please see here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Student Account and Outside School Child Account Creation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Currently Student Accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student\u2019s parent.\n(2) by the student\u2019s teacher.\nor (3) by the student themselves if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code.\nA parent may also set up an Outside School Child Account.</p>\n<p>(1) By the parent:\nWhen a parent sets up a Student Account for their child, they will first need a parent account.\nIn order to set up a parent account and be connected to their child\u2019s school, parents must first receive the unique parent code provided to their child by their child\u2019s teacher or sent through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique parent code or choose their child\u2019s teacher from the list shown from within the ClassDojo App or ClassDojo Website (the request to join the class must still be approved by the teacher).\nParents can also set up their account without this unique access code, but will not be connected to their child\u2019s school (or any activity on their child\u2019s account in school, such as feedback points or student uploaded content, Portfolio Comments or Student Activity Responses).\nIn accordance with COPPA, we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if the child is under 13, we will also then seek to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to proceed with creating their child\u2019s account.\nIf a parent is connected to their child\u2019s school, we don\u2019t ask the child\u2019s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the Student Account creation, but link the account to the name and information provided by the child\u2019s teacher.\nIf the parent is not connected to their child\u2019s school, the parent may provide their child\u2019s first and last name (at the option of the parent) and can create the Outside School Child Account.\nOnce we have obtained parental consent, the child\u2019s account will be set up and a QR code will be accessible on the parent's device to allow the child to log in to their Student Account or Outside School Child Account or a parent can let the child log in using Account Switcher.\nAlthough not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students and Outside School Child 13 and above at our discretion.</p>\n<p>(2) By the student\u2019s teacher:\nIf a student\u2019s school or teacher elects to utilize Student Accounts in school or otherwise sets up a student\u2019s account, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA (including if they choose to act as the agent of the parent and consent on the parent\u2019s behalf - commonly referred to as \u201cschool consent\u201d under COPPA) to create the Student Account on behalf of the student and let students access their accounts.\nThe teacher will provide the student\u2019s name to set up the account.\nAfter doing so, if the teacher is creating the Student\u2019s Account, the teacher will be able to share a QR code unique to each student (or one QR code for the entire class - at the teacher\u2019s discretion).\nStudents can scan the QR code and either enter their account directly (if an individual QR code) or tap their name from the list of names shown to them to (if one QR code per class) and log in and start using their student account.\nAdditionally, teachers may choose to allow students to log in on the Service using their Google for Education or other Google Accounts (\u201cGoogle Login(s)\u201d).\nPlease see here for more information on Google Login, including what we collect through the use of Google Login and how we use that information.\nWe don\u2019t ask students to enter any other personal information for their account registration when a teacher sets up their account.\nPlease note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to the school when the school is obtaining parental consent, we may send an email out to you asking you to verify your child\u2019s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.\nFor more information on school consent, please see the FTC\u2019s COPPA FAQ\u2019s.</p>\n<p>(3) By the student:\nAlternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own Student Account using the unique code provided by the teacher.\nWhen students set up their own ClassDojo Student Account, we ask students to provide a unique username (we advise students not to use their real names), a password and the unique code they have been given by their teacher to connect with the class.\nConsistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for the child\u2019s age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable).\nWe will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service.\n<strong>We don\u2019t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any Student Account (or access to a Student Account) created for the student by the parent, or the student\u2019s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts).\nAdditionally, any Outside School Child Account will also be linked with the Student Account if both exist), but only certain content will be viewable by the child\u2019s teacher.\nPlease see our FAQ for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Photos, Videos, Documents, Drawings, Student Activity Responses, and Journal Entries</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Once a Student Account is created (whether created by the student\u2019s teacher or parent or the student themself) and parental consent is obtained, students will be able to take and upload photos, videos, documents, Student Activity Responses, create drawings, and write journal entries (which may contain personal information) to their Student Account on Portfolios which will be collected by ClassDojo once the content has been actively saved by the child within the Service.\nUntil the content is actively saved by the child, it is temporarily stored locally on the child\u2019s device.\nThe portfolio can only be viewed by the student themself, the student\u2019s parents, and the student\u2019s teachers and school leaders.\nIf the school or teacher elects to utilize Student Accounts in the classroom, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA.\nAdditionally, the student\u2019s teacher must approve any posts made by students in their Student Account, including any Student Activity Responses, before it is shared with parents on Portfolios.\nAny content uploaded by a student in their Student Account in the classroom by their teacher, parent or themselves, or by the child or parent in their Outside School Child Account, will appear visible in both accounts.\nHowever, certain content uploaded in the Outside School Child\u2019s Account will not be viewable by the teacher in the Student Account.\nPlease see our FAQ for more details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We never request precise location data from students and no student location data is available publicly.\nFrom students, the primary form of location data is based on IP Address.\nIf students upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone's camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo\u2019s own application camera, we collect what the device send us.\nIf the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g.\ncamera model, lighting conditions and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data).\nWe strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Portfolios).\nIf a student accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device\u2019s own camera roll).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Viewing Stories</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Students with Student Accounts may also view or \u201clike\u201d content on the Class Story and School Story, however, they will not be able to post content (such as videos or photos) to either the Class Story or School Story.\nCurrently, students are limited to posting content to just their own portfolio or through access to the Premium Features given to them by their parents.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Portfolio Comments</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a student\u2019s teacher has elected to provide Portfolio Comments on their Student Activity Responses or any other content uploaded by students to Portfolios, the student may also respond to these comments.\nPrior to any student-uploaded content being viewed by the student\u2019s parents, the teacher must first approve this content.\nAdditionally, prior to this approval of portfolio content, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can\u2019t be viewed by the student\u2019s parent, but any connected parents will receive a notice indicating that Portfolio Comments is being utilized by their child\u2019s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child\u2019s teacher.\nOnce the Student Activity Responses (or other content) has been approved by the student\u2019s teacher, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable by the parent (but may have been previously edited by the student\u2019s teacher).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Premium Features</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Parents may choose to allow their children to access and use certain Premium Features within the child\u2019s Student Account or their Outside School Child\u2019s Account.\nA parent will first need to have their own parent account, and be required to use either their Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method to purchase the Premium Features.\nIf a parent is purchasing Premium Features from within their child\u2019s Student Account or Outside School Child\u2019s Account, they will also need to go through a \u201cparental gate\u201d prior to purchasing.\nPrior to allowing your child (or children) access to their Student Account or Outside School Child\u2019s Account in order to access the Premium Features, we will also require parental consent.\nOnce we have obtained parental consent, the children\u2019s features will be unlocked for their children to utilize within their Student Account or Outside School Child\u2019s Account.\nAlthough not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students or children 13 and above at our discretion.\nA parent can award Points as well as rewards and goals (as defined below) to a child for educational and other learning activities completed at home.\nThis content (or the Points, Rewards, and Goals awarded at home) is then viewable by the parent and child within the Premium Features section of their respective account and is not viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students.\nThis content can be deleted by the parent or child.\nIn addition, the child can customize their monster, and these changes to their monster may be shown in their Student Account in class.\nPlease see our FAQ for more details.</p>\n<p>In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the \"Information collected automatically\" section, this includes device data (such as platform, app version and device ID) and product event data (such as the last activity a child started or whether they viewed a certain report) from the child\u2019s device, such as for Premium Features or logging in via QR code to their Student Account on the parent's device.\nThese are collected for internal analysis on product usage and quality and we may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending push or email notifications to the child (as set forth below) to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service.</p>\n<p>We also receive from the child\u2019s teacher (and link to the student\u2019s account) whatever name he or she has provided for the student, the student\u2019s grade, the feedback points given by that teacher, and content uploaded by the teacher to the student\u2019s portfolio (such as student responses to activities and Portfolio Comments).\nTeachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class.\nthey can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name and seat number).\nThis chart details the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect from students and Outside School Child Users to provide and improve the Service to the child, for educational, security and safety purposes, as required by law, or to enforce our Terms.\nAdditionally, we use the information we collect from Outside School Child Users as set forth here.\nWe will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service.\nIf we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent's consent for that collection.\nWe do not disclose any personal information about children to third-parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, authorized school personnel (such as school leaders) as directed by the child's school, as directed by the child\u2019s parents, as required by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users.\nInformation collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising.\nWe also do not place any third-party advertisements in student logged-in areas of the Service.\nAdditionally, personal information collected from students is <strong>never</strong> used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students by us or any third-party, and children\u2019s personal information is <strong>never</strong> sold or rented to anyone, including marketers and advertisers.\nWe may present contextually relevant educational content (not using student personal information) for either our own products (e.g.\nPremium Features) or third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to a student (e.g., our co-created content with Yale University on Mindfulness) or Outside School Child User.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>ClassDojo has been certified by iKeepSafe, an FTC-approved COPPA Safe Harbor, for compliance with their COPPA Safe Harbor program.\nWe don\u2019t ask for or require children to provide personal information beyond that which is reasonably necessary to use ClassDojo.\nInformation collected from students or Outside School Child Users is <strong>never</strong> used or disclosed for third-party advertising or any kind of behaviorally-targeted advertising, and it is <strong>never</strong> sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.\nPlease see this chart for the detailed categories of information we collect from each user type and how we use the information, as well as the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose..</p>\n</blockquote> Push Notifications\n<p>ClassDojo may send push notifications to students or Outside School ChildUsers- for example, letting them know when their weekly report is ready, or telling them about an achievement milestone they reached! We require children provide a parent\u2019s email address before he or she can receive push notifications from ClassDojo (or have a Student Account or Outside School Child\u2019s Account previously set up on ClassDojo by their parent or teacher, with any necessary parental consent obtained).\nWe will then provide the parent with notice (if the account was set up by them or their child) and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications.\nThe device identifier for a child\u2019s account will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided.\nIf you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer want these communications to be sent, please either turn off the push notifications on your device, or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>Before ever sending a push notification to a child, if the child or the parent sets up the child\u2019s account on the Service, we will provide notice to parents, or obtain parental consent.\nWe rely on teachers to obtain any necessary personal information if they set up the child\u2019s account.\nParents can always opt-out (or withdraw consent) later as well by turning off the push notifications on their child\u2019s device or contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com.</p>\n</blockquote> What Children\u2019s Information is Visible to Others?\n<p>No Student\u2019s Account, or Outside School Child\u2019s Account, profile, or portfolio is made available or visible to the public through ClassDojo.\nOnly the student, the student\u2019s parents, and the student\u2019s teachers or school leaders can see the student\u2019s profile and portfolio.\nNo child can upload content (such as a photo, video, drawing, journal entry, or document) to the Service except through their Student Account, or if their parent has allowed their child access to certain Premium Features in their Student Account or Outside School Child\u2019s Account.\nThis can\u2019t happen for children without either (1) the parent providing parental consent directly to ClassDojo or (2) the child\u2019s teacher representing to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent, including acting as the agent of the parent if their school policy allows.\nAdditionally, the student\u2019s teacher must approve any post made by students before it is shared with parents on the student\u2019s portfolio.\nIf a student adds content to their account in the classroom, students can\u2019t view each other\u2019s individual Student Accounts or portfolio unless they have intentionally chosen another student\u2019s name from the list of names shown to them while logging in or viewed the camera roll locally on the device that may be saving photos and videos taken by students.\nTeachers also have the option to use individual QR codes specific to each student for login purposes.\nParents are able to view their own child\u2019s portfolio (through their own parent account) after the teacher has approved the student-submitted content, including Portfolio Comments and Student Activity Responses.\nPlease note that parents may not see prior drafts of the student-submitted content or Portfolio Comments prior to the final teacher approval that allows parents to access and view and may not see all feedback points awarded by the teacher in school if the teacher has elected not to show these.</p>\n<p>Class Story and School Story are visible by students, teachers, parents and school leaders who have logged into their accounts and are associated with that particular class or school.\nThey are not viewable by the general public.\nParents, teachers and school leaders can add content or comments to these stories, but students can only view or like content on these stories and are only able to do this once either the school or ClassDojo has obtained parental consent, if under 13.</p>\n<p>Teachers may share their classes, including feedback points, Portfolios, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school.\nPlease note that if the teacher chooses to project their own ClassDojo teacher account in their classroom, students physically present in that classroom may see other students\u2019 names and total feedback points - this is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work.\nTeachers, however, can choose to never project or display their own teacher account in class, and therefore keep student feedback points and Portfolios private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents \u2014 and many do!</p>\n<p>Content uploaded by children or Points, Rewards, or Goals awarded within Premium Features or the Outside School Child\u2019s Account is viewable by the parent and any children accessing such Premium Features within their respective accounts.\nthe content is not viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students.\nThe customization of the monster by the child within Premium Features may be viewable within the child\u2019s Student Account (and thus viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students in the classroom).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>By default, the full set of feedback and content posted, including Portfolio Comments and Student Activity Responses, to a Student\u2019s Account is private to the student, their teacher(s), school leader, and their parents (once the content is approved by the teacher).\nIf a teacher displays their teacher account publicly in class, then students may see other students\u2019 total feedback points, and potentially classwork on Portfolios.\nParents can view all teacher-approved posts, including Portfolio Comments and Student Activity Responses, shared on their child\u2019s portfolio, as well as every post shared on Class Story and School Story.\nStudents can view and like, but not upload, content and comments on Class Story and School Story (once parental consent has been obtained by ClassDojo or their school/teacher).\nParents may not see all feedback points awarded by the teacher in school if the teacher has elected not to show these.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Content uploaded or Points, Rewards, and Goals awarded within Premium Features is viewable by the parent and the children accessing such Premium Features within their respective accounts.\nthe content is not viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students.\nThe customization of the monster by the child within Premium Features may be viewable within the child\u2019s student account (and thus viewable by the child\u2019s teacher or other students in the classroom).</p> How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children\u2019s Information?\n<p>We will not retain a child\u2019s personal information for any longer than is necessary for educational purposes or legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the child\u2019s personal information.\nAdditionally, we only keep a child\u2019s personal information for as long as his or her Student Account or Outside School Child Account is active, unless we are required by law or the child\u2019s school (for Student Accounts) to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms.\nMore specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students\u2019 (not just children\u2019s) information (<strong>\u201c3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy\u201d</strong>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Minimal information:</strong> ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to use the Service.\nFor more information, see above.\nIn addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the \u201cInformation collected automatically\u201d section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>One year deletion policy for feedback points:</strong>\nTo protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students\u2019 feedback points given in the classroom are retained.\nFor all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted.\nFor example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2020, on January 1, 2021 any feedback points added in that class on or before January 1, 2010 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age) regardless of whether or not a student has his or her own account (and if that account is active).\nThis means feedback points cannot exist long-term.\nTeachers can also delete feedback points at any time.\nFor more information on feedback points that parents can award Outside School, please see our FAQ.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Deleting inactive Student Accounts:</strong>\nIf a student\u2019s Student Account is inactive for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student, added content to a student\u2019s portfolio, or messaged with the

Accounts here.\nPlease note that certain content 1) within a Student Account or student portfolio (uploaded by the student, teacher or parent), such as photos, videos, Student Activity Responses or Portfolio Comments, or 2) uploaded by a teacher, school leader, parent, or student through Class Story or School Story may be kept after deletion of a Student Account as we are required to retain these at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of \u201ceducation records\u201d under FERPA or \u201cStudent Data\u201d under state student privacy

child\u2019s school (for Student Accounts) to retain it, need it to enforce our policies, or to ensure the security of our community.\nAdditionally, we protect students with our industry-leading 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we collect only minimal information from students necessary to register for an account on the Service, (2) we automatically delete their feedback points given in the classroom after a year, and (3) we delete Students\u2019 Accounts if they\u2019re inactive for more than twelve months.\nPlease note that this does not include certain content uploaded by the teacher, parent, or student to the portfolio that maybe considered an \u201ceducation record\u201d under FERPA or other state student privacy laws as we are required to retain these at the direction of the school.\nPlease see our FAQ about how to request deletion of this content.\nFor more information on the deletion of content related to our Premium Features and Outside School Child

set up their Student Account or Outside School Child\u2019s Account, or you allow them access to Premium Features, and you have a parent account connected to the student, you may access, review, correct, or delete any of your child\u2019s personal information in the Service by emailing privacy@classdojo.com with the same email used to create your parent account or by contacting us here once you are signed into your parent account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note however, that any content uploaded (e.g., photos, videos, Student Activity Responses, Portfolio Comments), that is requested as part of a Student Account, class at a school, or otherwise directed by your child\u2019s teacher or school, is retained at the direction of the school (e.g., for legal compliance reasons such as maintenance of \u201ceducation records\u201d under FERPA).\nto correct or delete this content, please contact the appropriate official at your child\u2019s school.\nIf the school determines that the request should be implemented, the school may either make the change themselves or submit the request to ClassDojo by emailing privacy@classdojo.com or by contacting us here</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If your child\u2019s Student Account was set up by your child\u2019s school (e.g., to allow the student to login via a QR code, class text code, or Google Login): If your child\u2019s school set up their Student Account directly and obtained your consent (or chose to act as an agent and consent on your behalf) and you do not have a parent account connected to your child, please contact the appropriate

Service (described below under \u201cInformation you provide to us\u201d) and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under \u201cInformation collected automatically\u201d).\nWe may also receive information about you from third-party sources (as described below under \u201cInformation Received from Third-Party Sources\u201d).\nThe types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, school leader, parent, student or Outside School Child User (e.g., we collect minimal information from students and Outside School Child User\u2019s to register for an account on our Service) and how they use ClassDojo (e.g., if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).\nWe have also created this chart with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>ClassDojo asks for some limited information directly from teachers, school leaders, parents, Outside School Child Users and students (such as account information), and also collects some information automatically (such as crash reports when errors occur) in order to provide you with the best possible ClassDojo experience.\nPlease see this chart for the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.</p>\n</blockquote> Information you provide to us\n<p>We ask for and collect the following personal information about you when you use the Service.\nThis information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations.\nWithout it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services.</p>\n<p>There are currently four categories of users on our Service: teachers, school leaders, parents, and students (including those Outside School Child Users who use the Services outside of school with our Premium Features).\nAdditionally, as a non-logged in visitor to the ClassDojo Website, you may provide personal information to us as set forth in our separate ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy.\nWe describe the information collected from students and Outside School Child Users in the \u201cHow We Protect Children\u2019s Personal Information\u201d section above.\nfor other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Account Sign-up and Profile Information:</strong> To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo.\nIf a student\u2019s teacher is creating the Student Account on behalf of the student, they will provide the student\u2019s name and grade.\nThis same information is also used to create the Student Account on the parent\u2019s behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional personal information of their child if a parent is connected to the school with the unique parent code).\nIf the parent is creating their child\u2019s account and is not connected to their child\u2019s school, they may provide additional information about their child (such as first and last name).\nTeacher and school leader profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school.\nhowever, no teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>School Information and Collaboration Features:</strong> If you are a teacher or school leader, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school\u2019s address if we do not have it already.\nIf you are using the Service as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you, including to help connect your parent account to your child\u2019s school (e.g., our \u201cFind a Teacher\u201d feature).\nThis data is only temporarily captured and not stored beyond the initial search request for schools near the user and is not viewable by other users.\nBy connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers and school leaders within the same school (and parents of children at that school) such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on Class Story or School Story for parents, students and other verified teachers in that school to see.\nLearn more about our current collaboration features and what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, students and parents and who can view these stories here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Information:</strong> As a teacher, you enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class.\nIt is the teacher\u2019s choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter John S or John Smith.\nAlternatively, teachers can also upload a spreadsheet to the Service with the student\u2019s first and last names, or choose students from the School Directory if they are already in a class of a verified teacher within the school.\nIf a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or school leaders in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class\u2019s information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Inviting Others and Sharing Content:</strong> As a teacher or school leader, you can invite your students\u2019 parents to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo.\nAs a parent, school leader, or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service or share certain content (e.g., as a parent within Premium Features) by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email or SMS.\nWe will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWe may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book.\nIf these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Messaging:</strong> As a teacher or school leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, including through Portfolios, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the ClassDojo Messaging, Class Story, and School Story features.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a parent, you can also message with your child\u2019s teacher through ClassDojo Messaging as well as through comments on Portfolios, Class Story, and School Story posts.\nAs a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a \u2018read receipt\u2019 showing how many parents have read your message.\nPlease be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature, such as Class Story or School Story, any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, students (whose parents have provided verifiable parental consent to ClassDojo (or the student\u2019s teacher has represented they have obtained any necessary parental consent, and teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively.\nIn the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), the student or parent can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com to remove it, subject to any photo or record being deemed an \u201ceducation record\u201d under FERPA.\nIf a photo or video is considered an \u201ceducation record\u201d you will need to first contact your child\u2019s school to request removal.\nFor more information on when photos or videos are considered an \u201ceducation record\u201d please see the Department of Education\u2019s guidance here.\nWe will store messages, including those on Class Story, School Story, and Portfolios, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents.\nFor more information on how long these are retained, please see here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Portfolio Comments:</strong> Teachers can also add Portfolio Comments to their students (e.g., on any student\u2019s uploaded content, including Student Activity Responses) within Portfolios (including prior to any content being shown to the student\u2019s parent).\nOnce the teacher has approved any student-uploaded content, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable to the child\u2019s parent (but may have been edited by the student or teacher prior to being shown to the parent).\nPrior to this approval, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can\u2019t be viewed by the student\u2019s parent, but any connected parent will receive a notice indicating that Portfolio Comments is being utilized by their child\u2019s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child\u2019s teacher.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Content:</strong> Teachers, school leaders, and parents may upload photos, videos, and other content, including content that may contain personal information and can be viewed by others, for example, on Class Story or School Story.\nLearn more about what information may be collected and shared from teachers, school leaders, students and parents and who can view these stories here.\nAdditionally, teachers can post Activities on ClassDojo.\nSuch information may include activity title, instructions, and the type of content they expect students to respond with (e..g, photo, video, drawing, or journal entry).\nOnce a teacher publishes such Activities, they can be viewed by their students, other teachers using ClassDojo at that teacher\u2019s school, and by other teachers that ClassDojo may share with pursuant to the Terms of Service (unless a teacher opts-out), but they will not be viewable by the general public.\nParents can also upload photos, videos, and other content, which may contain personal information, through utilizing the Messaging and Premium Features.\nParents can also purchase certain content from a Class Story or School Story, but must first confirm that they are giving us consent to use any content that might be deemed an \u201ceducation record\u201d or \u201cStudent Data\u201d in this manner.\nPlease see our FAQ for more information.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Rewards and Goals:</strong> Parents are given a certain set of default \u201crewards\u201d that they can then edit and create within Premium Features (\u201cRewards\u201d).\nAdditionally, within Premium Features, parents can create goals - where they select a specific skill their child is working on and specify a target number of points to achieve the particular goal (\u201cGoals\u201d).\nParents can then give points for a specific skill to contribute towards the Goals and once a Goal is completed, a parent may award a Reward.\nRewards and Goals given at home can only be accessed through the parent account or the child\u2019s Outside School Child\u2019s Account, teachers and other students are not able to see these Rewards or Goals or to contribute points to them.\nWe collect product events (e.g.\nthe value of the Rewards or Goals, whether a parent has created a goal, the number of Rewards or Goals given and Reward or Goal name) from the parent.\nThese are collected for internal analysis on product usage and quality.\nWe may also use it to track progress in the app, and for sending push and email notifications to a parent\u2019s email or device to encourage them to take actions within the Service (such as creating a goal).\nAdditionally, after giving a Reward a parent may take a photo - this photo is saved to the parents camera roll locally on the device, we do not capture or save these photos.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Purchasing Premium Features:</strong> As a parent, when you purchase any Premium Features, you will first need to have your own parent account.\nYou will then be required to use either your Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method to purchase the Premium Features.\nPrior to allowing your child (or children) access to the Premium Features within their Outside School Child Account (or if any children\u2019s personal information, educational records or Student Data are utilized in the Premium Features that previously relied on \u201cschool consent\u201d), we will also require parental consent.\nPlease see our FAQ for more information.\nWe do not collect any credit card information directly from parents to purchase Premium Features, nor is any credit card data passed back to us from any payment method you used to purchase the Premium Features.\nPlease see here for a list of what information we receive from third-parties in connection with your payment method.\nParents may also share their Premium Features subscription with other parents through their account settings.\nPlease see here for more information on sharing your Premium Features subscription.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Testimonials:</strong> We may collect certain personal information (such as your name, photo, and/or video) if you choose to give us a testimonial.\nWe post testimonials on our Service which may contain this personal information in the testimonial.\nWe obtain the individual\u2019s consent in advance to ensure we have permission to post this content publicly.\nTo request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, please contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact Information:</strong> As a user of the Service, you may choose to provide us with your personal information, such as a name, email address and telephone number.\nSome examples include when you send us an email asking a question, participate in a video testimonial about our Service, or choose to participate in any research efforts with ClassDojo to improve the Service).\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you send us a message using the \"Contact Us\" page or via email, the email addresses and phone numbers collected are not further used to market to the individual beyond providing the services requested or responding to the requests.</p>\n<p>Our use of the information above is described below in the section \u201cHow Does ClassDojo Use the Information it Collects.\u201d If you are using the ClassDojo App, we may ask you for certain permissions - please see here for more detail about those permissions.\nWe have also prepared this chart of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>We ask you for different types of information based on who you are (i.e., teacher, school leader, parent, and student) and which ClassDojo features you use (e.g., sending a message between a teacher and a parent, or helping a teacher or parent join their school).\nWe have also prepared this chart of the personal information we collect, how we use it, and where it is stored.</p>\n</blockquote> Information collected automatically\n<p>When you use the Service, we (or our service providers) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information, including personal information, from your browser or your device about the services you use and how you use them.\nThis information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service.\nFor example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show).\nIf you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices.\nIf we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>The technologies and information we automatically collect include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and other similar technologies:</strong> We (or our service providers) may use cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device.\nWe (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in student logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Service that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site).\nWe don\u2019t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our Service (i.e.\nsuch as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with Yale University on Mindfulness).\nPlease read our Online Tracking Technologies Policy for more details, including how to modify your cookie settings and a list of the tracking technologies we use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Local storage:</strong> We may also use, collect, and store information and preferences locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser-based web storage (including HTTP cookies and HTML5) and application data caches.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Like many services, ClassDojo (or our service providers) uses both local storage and cookies and other similar technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand your engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.\nPlease read our Online Tracking Technologies Policy for more details.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device information:</strong> We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.\nThis helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you\u2019ve opted in to receive them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile application information:</strong> Certain mobile applications or \u201capps\u201d include a unique application number.\nThis number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, when you open the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.\nAdditionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve the ClassDojo App.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Server log information:</strong> Like most online services, when you use our Service we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs.\nExamples include things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Details of how you used our Service, such as your activity on the Service (including product event data used to track progress or user activity), and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Service (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Telephony log information like your phone number and SMS routing information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IP address</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular and to send notifications to a device (such as push notifications if the user opted in) to encourage the user to finish an activity or start the next activity.\nWe may use your IP address and share it with third parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Service, to enhance the Services based on usage pattern data and, for analytics and for advertising.\nThird party sharing of IP address information for analytics and advertising is not allowed for student and Outside School Child Users.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Location information:</strong> When you use our Service, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example based on your IP address.\nWe collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data.\nIf we request precise geolocation information (\u201cprecise\u201d meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher or parent is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission.\nWe <strong>never</strong> request precise geolocation data from students.\nFrom all users, if they upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone's camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo\u2019s own application camera, we collect what the device send us.\nIf the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g.\ncamera model, lighting conditions and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data).\nWe strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Messaging).\nIf a user accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device\u2019s own camera roll).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not store or track your precise device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.\nWe do not share precise geolocation data with third-parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service.\nIf you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cross-device collection:</strong> To provide users with a seamless online experience, we may link your identifiers on different browsers and environments you are using our syncing technology, DojoCast.\nWith DojoCast, ClassDojo is able to provide a seamless experience across multiple devices and browsers without collecting or processing any additional identifying personal data.\nWe may also work with third party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>We collect some information from you automatically (and additionally use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information) so that we know when things go wrong, or to help us understand what parts of ClassDojo need some improvement.\nIf we need to request street-level (\u201cprecise\u201d) geolocation data from you as a teacher, school leader, or parent, we\u2019ll ask for your explicit, opt-in consent.\nWe never request precise geolocation data from students.</p>\n</blockquote> Information received from third-party sources\n<p>We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third-party sources to update or supplement the information you provided or we collected automatically.\nThis may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us.\nIf we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nIf we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nAdditionally, we may use any aggregated anonymous information received by third-parties as set forth below under the heading \u201cAggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information\u201d.\nLocal law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.\nWe do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.\nPlease see this chart with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>We may collect some information from third-party sources, such as SurveyMonkey when we send questionnaires to teachers and parents.\nThat information will be handled under this Privacy Policy.\nPlease see this chart with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal

preventing activities that may violate our policies or be illegal</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use automatically collected information (described in the \"Information collected automatically\" section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.\nTo learn more about how we use your information for personalization and tracking, please see the Online Tracking Technologies Policy.</p>\n<p>We process this information given our legitimate interest in improving the Service and our users\u2019 experience with it, in protecting the Service, where necessary for the adequate performance of the contract with you, and to comply with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will process your personal information for the purposes listed in this section related to marketing given our legitimate interests in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest.\nYou can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our marketing communications or changing your notification settings within your ClassDojo

personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students.\nWe use your information to provide and personalize the Service to you, optimize and

information about events, announcements, offers, promotions, products, including third-party products, and services we think will be of interest to you.</p>\n</blockquote> Will ClassDojo share any information it collects?\n<p>First and foremost, you should know that ClassDojo <strong>does not (and will not) sell or rent</strong> your (or your child\u2019s) personal information to any third-party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes.\nThird-party advertising is not permitted on areas where users are required to log in to ClassDojo and personal information collected from students is never used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students (by us or third-parties).\nFurthermore, we do not share personal information with any third-parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy and as set forth below:</p>\nOther Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo\n<p>No teacher, school leader, parent or student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service.\nFurthermore, students cannot share their account information or portfolio with anyone on ClassDojo, outside of their parents, teachers, or school leaders.\nIf you are a teacher, school leader, or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers, school leaders, students, or parents - for example, things like your account information, feedback points awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher or school leader) or to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers, school leaders, or parents you are communicating with through ClassDojo Messaging, Class Story, School Story, Portfolios, or our other collaboration features.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and school leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with.\nWe cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information and we are not responsible for the collection, use or disclosure of such information or content by others.</p>\nThird-party integrations on our Service\n<p>When, as a teacher, school leader, student, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share.\nFor example, when you share a Big Ideas activity on Twitter or Facebook, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality, and information that you are sharing from ClassDojo.\nPlease see here for more information on third-party services.\nPlease see here for a list of third-party app integrations on our Service and the ClassDojo Website.</p>\nService Providers\n<p>We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we can\u2019t build everything ourselves, after all! These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d).\nWe may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security.\nWe may also authorize these third-party companies to collect information on our behalf.\nThese providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed.\nAdditionally, these partners and service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nPlease see here for a list of the third-parties we work with to provide the Service and the ClassDojo Website.</p>\nSocial Media Platforms\n<p>Where permissible according to applicable law, we may share certain limited personal information with social media platforms (such as Google or Facebook) and other websites, applications or partners, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise market and advertise our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students).\nThese processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest.\nThese social media platforms with which we may share your personal information are not controlled or supervised by ClassDojo.\nTherefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform processes your personal information should be directed to such provider.</p>\nAnalytics Services\n<p>We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used.\nThese services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.\nA current list of analytics providers that we use is located here.</p>\nAggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information\n<p>We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other de-identified or non-personally identifiable information (such as statistics about visitors, traffic and usage patterns), including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how ClassDojo is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo.\nAny aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information.</p>\nLegal Requirements\n<p>We may disclose information, including personal information, if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.\nWe may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.\nThis includes, without limitation, responding to law enforcement and government requests.\nWhere appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law.\n(ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon ClassDojo, or its users.\nIn instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>\nFraud and Security Protection\n<p>We may share information to assist with security operations for scheduled penetration testing, auditing, and continuous improvement of our security practices, including without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.\nAuthorized parties of the information would comply with our current privacy and security policies.</p>\nSharing with ClassDojo Companies\n<p>Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize.\nWe may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\nChange of control\n<p>The Student Privacy Pledge requires us (and all pledgers) to commit to how we handle data in the event of a change to our organizations such that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, or in any other situation where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party.\nConsistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, if any, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).\nWe will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company.\nWe may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (or their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion.\n</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event that ClassDojo goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third-party.\nFor more information on our practices regarding your data if we go out of business, please see our FAQ.</p>\nWith your consent\n<p>Other than the cases above, we won\u2019t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>ClassDojo doesn\u2019t (and won\u2019t) sell or rent your personal information to any third-parties.\nWe believe your information is yours, and you should own it - we think that\u2019s the right way to operate.\nWe share some information with service providers who help us provide you with the Service \u2013 like companies that help us send emails, for example, or if we have to to comply with the law.\nAdditionally, you may choose to share information with other users of the Service or to third-parties that are integrated on our Service.</p>\n<p>And, if ClassDojo is ever acquired or goes out of business, our commitments don\u2019t change: we still won\u2019t sell or rent your personal information to anyone.\nYour personal information will continue to be protected by this policy, and any company that acquires ClassDojo will have to abide by this policy, unless you give consent to a new policy.</p>\n</blockquote> How does ClassDojo protect and secure my information?\n<p>Your ClassDojo account is protected by a password or a QR code.\nYou can help us protect against unauthorized

encryption and salted hashing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Service is hosted on servers at a third-party facility, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures.\nFor example, personal information is stored on a server equipped with industry standard firewalls.\nIn addition, the hosting facility provides a 24x7 security system, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems and locked cage areas.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We automatically delete inactive student accounts after a specific period of time, as per our retention policy, described in the \u201cHow Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children\u2019s Information?\u201d section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also operate a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 security program to encourage an active community of third-party security researchers to report any security bugs to us.\nMore information on this is available by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We restrict access to personal information to authorized ClassDojo employees, agents or independent contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For additional information on our security practices, please see our Security Whitepaper and our Privacy Center.\nAlthough we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100%

any time.\nIf we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws and school reporting requirements) so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nfor example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.classdojo.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us.\nDepending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>The security of your information is important to us, and we take it very seriously.\nWe\u2019re always adding safeguards to ensure the safety and security of ClassDojo and our community of teachers, school leaders, parents, and students.\nYou can help us out by

concerning information residing on backup systems).\n</p>\n<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort or if more than two times a year for access rights.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>You have certain rights to access, update and correct your personal information.\nYou can always access and

Service, including via email, web alert, text messages, push notifications and other similar means, in accordance with the preferences you set through the Service.</p>\n<p>ClassDojo does not charge you for our text message features.\nBut message and data rates may apply, so depending on your plan with your wireless or other applicable provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other applicable provider.\n</p>\n<p>(ii) <strong>Creating Your Child\u2019s Account.</strong> If you would like to create your child\u2019s student account at home, you must first have created a parent account on ClassDojo.\nTo create your child\u2019s student account, we will first require your Consent.\nIn order to comply with COPPA and similar laws in other applicable jurisdictions, which govern the online collection of data from children, Classdojo may take additional steps to verify that the user granting permission for the creation of a child\u2019s student account is his or her parent or legal guardian.\nThe current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our FAQ.\nAs part of the process of creating your child\u2019s student account, we will link the information given by your child\u2019s teacher (such as your child\u2019s name and feedback points) to your child\u2019s student account and you will not need to provide any additional registration information for your child.\nAdditionally, instead of creating a password for your child\u2019s account, your child will log in with the QR code that is generated once you Consent and create the student account.\nIn order to protect the security of your child's account, you should keep this QR code confidential.\n</p>\n<p>Once your child has a student account (including if your child created their own Student Created Account (after you have Consented) or your child\u2019s teacher has created the student account on your child\u2019s behalf, they will be able to upload User Content, including Student Activity Responses, to the student account and Portfolios (which is not viewable by the general public, but by linked parents and School Personnel).\nYou are responsible for ensuring that such submissions (when not used during school) meet all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in \u201cYour Information and Content\u201d and the \u201cAcceptable Use and Conduct\u201d Sections.\nYou can request to remove any User Content uploaded by your child either by 1) contacting your child\u2019s School Personnel if the User Content was uploaded during school, and we will respond to valid requests received from the School Personnel or Institution, or 2) contacting us directly at privacy@classdojo.com when the User Content is collected directly from your child while not at school, including when ClassDojo obtains the parent consent directly (not the school).\n</p>\n<p>(ii) **Premium Features **.\nIf you are accessing or using the Premium Features, or allowing your child to access and use, you will also be subject to the Premium Features and Promotions Terms.\nAdditionally, if you are allowing your child to access and use Premium Features on your device or account, we will first require your Consent.\nIn order to comply with COPPA and similar laws in other applicable jurisdictions, which govern the online collection of data from children, Classdojo may take additional steps to verify that the user granting permission to allow the child to use the Premium Features is his or her parent or legal guardian.\nThe current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our FAQ.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>Parents: if your child is under 13 and you create a ClassDojo student account for them at home, allow them to access Premium Features on your device or account, or they create one with a unique student code, we\u2019ll need your permission to set up their account.\nIf your child\u2019s teacher or other school personnel wants to create your child\u2019s student account on their behalf, they will obtain your permission (or, depending on school policy, act as your agent and consent on your behalf in what is commonly referred to as \u201cschool consent\u201d).</p>\n</blockquote> FERPA\n<p>ClassDojo understands that it is important that our partner schools comply with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (\"FERPA\") and related regulations.\nCertain information that may be provided to ClassDojo by School Personnel that is directly related to a student and maintained by an Institution, may be considered an education record (\u201cEducation Record\u201d) under FERPA.\nAdditionally, certain information, provided to Company by School Personnel about a student, such as student name and grade level, may be considered directory information under FERPA (\u201cDirectory Information\u201d) and thus not an Education Record.\nPlease see our DPA for more information regarding FERPA, ClassDojo\u2019s commitments to help Institution\u2019s comply with FERPA, and Institution\u2019s obligations with respect to FERPA.\nClassDojo is not in a position to provide legal advice regarding whether the school's existing FERPA disclosures are sufficient.\nTo the extent that School Personnel have questions regarding these issues, they should consult the school's own legal counsel for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>FERPA gives parents and students certain rights over their education records.\nFERPA requires schools to not share PII in education records without either meeting an exemption or obtaining parental permission.\nSo, if a teacher provides student information to ClassDojo, the school must either meet an exemption or obtain the appropriate permission in advance.\nPlease see our DPA for more information regarding FERPA, ClassDojo\u2019s commitments to help Institution\u2019s comply with FERPA, and Institution\u2019s obligations with respect to FERPA.\n</p>\n</blockquote> Social Media and Third-Party Authentication Services\n<p>Company may, now or in the future, incorporate certain functions

objectionable, and that you use the Service at your own risk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>We\u2019re not responsible for any third-party content posted, or third-party websites or services linked from our service, or any disputes you may have with them.</p>\n</blockquote> User Interactions and Release\n<p>\n<strong>User Disputes</strong>.\nClassDojo is not responsible for the actions, content, information or data of other third parties, including other Users.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Services, and any other parties with whom you interact through the Service.\nYou should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline interaction with any other person.\nWe reserves the right, but have no obligation, to become involved in any way with these disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Release</strong>.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release us (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, successors, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes, including damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use , privacy or data.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code \u00a71542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\" And, if you are not a California resident, you waive any applicable state statutes of a similar effect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>There are many people who use ClassDojo.\nAlthough we expect every user to follow our guidelines, we are not responsible for their actions.\nWe\u2019ll enforce our acceptable use and other guidelines, but we won\u2019t get involved in, nor are we responsible for any disputes you may have with other users of ClassDojo.</p>\n</blockquote> Term and Termination\n<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service unless your account is terminated as provided in this Agreement (\u201cTerm\u201d).\nCertain Users (e.g., parents and School Personnel) may terminate their use of the Service or your account at any time by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com provided, however, that an Institution may require satisfaction of certain requirements before School Personnel can terminate their account.\nAs a parent, if you created your child\u2019s account (or your child is not using the Service at school), you can also terminate your child\u2019s account the same way, although we will need to verify your identity (such as requiring that you send the request to us from the same email address you used to provide your consent to activate the student account originally).\nParents of students whose accounts were created (or directed to be used by) your child\u2019s teacher in school will first need to contact your child\u2019s school to request termination.\nPlease see our FAQ for what information is deleted when you terminate or delete your account.\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that, if you knowingly, intentionally or negligently violate this Agreement, ClassDojo may suspend your license to the Services, in whole or in part, until the violation has stopped or terminate your license and use of the Services.\nIn the event that you fail to correct the violation after reasonable notice from ClassDojo, ClassDojo may terminate your license and use of the Services and this Agreement.\nYou agree and if such termination or suspension occurs, ClassDojo shall bear no responsibility or liability for any damages or claims resulting from or in connection with such actions, including the loss of information associated with your account.\n</p>\n<p>The following does not apply in the unforeseen circumstances in which ClassDojo ceases operations or files for bankruptcy at which point ClassDojo may terminate or suspend all User accounts and licenses with or without notice to you, and with no liability to you.\nWe believe that you (or your school as applicable) own your data and preserving access to such data is important.\nIf we discontinue the Service (such as if we went out of business), where reasonably possible, we will give you advance notice and a chance to get information out of the Service.\nClick here for more information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>There is no obligation to use our Service, and you can stop using your account, or delete it completely, at any time.\nWe can do that for you, too.\nHowever, if you are a student (or parent of a student) - you (or you parent) must first contact your school if you wish to terminate your account created at your school and your school can tell you what the process will be.\nAdditionally, we might suspend or terminate your account if you violate our rules or the law.\n</p>\n</blockquote> Dispute Resolution\n<p>a) Generally: In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Company agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service.\nYou understand and agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>\n<p>b) Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>\n<p>c) Arbitration: Any arbitration between you and Company will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.</p>\n<p>d) Notice.\nProcess: A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"Notice\").\nCompany's address for Notice is: Class Twist, Inc., 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America.\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nprovided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Company shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, and (ii) the greatest amount offered by Company in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p>e) Fees: In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>f) No Class Actions: you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\nFurther, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>g) Enforceability: if only Subsection F of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in this Section shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>It is our goal to quickly and efficiently resolve disputes that may arise.\nFor that reason, we require disputes to be submitted to arbitration.\nIf you bring a dispute in arbitration that is $10,000 or less, ClassDojo will pay all the filing fees and make arrangements for non-appearance based proceedings (if you prefer).\nAdditionally, we each waive rights to bring class actions.</p>\n</blockquote> Miscellaneous\n<p>The failure of either party to exercise, in any respect, any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nCompany shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Company's reasonable control.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nThis Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Company's prior written consent.\nCompany may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without restriction.\nThis Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to the conflict of laws provisions thereof.\nTo the extent any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement is permitted to be brought in a court of law, such claim shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and for all purposes of this Agreement, you and Company consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts.\nUnless and solely to the extent that you or your Institution have a separate written agreement with Company that governs your use of the Service (in which case such agreement will control), we both agree that this Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that the Agreement may not be modified, except as otherwise provided herein.\nThis Agreement and any subsequent versions of this Agreement posted to the Website will be deemed a writing signed by both parties.\nNo agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any respect whatsoever.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>Please abide by these terms - we will!</p>\n</blockquote> Contact Information\n<p>For information about how to contact Company, please visit our contact page.</p>\n", "created_at": "2021-06-19 15:32:15.645687", "updated_at":
