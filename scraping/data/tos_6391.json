ideologies and standards.<br>\nIn order to help protect users and provide the most relevant and appropriate content per each user's preferences, it is important that all users act responsibly, correctly labeling/categorizing their own content, especially when it falls into more adult themed categories.<br>\nUsers can select through their account settings, various \"Content Rating Levels\", which algorithmically determines what content may be most suitable and interesting for that user.<br>\nBelow is a description of each rating level: <ul>\n<li>\n<b>Family Safe</b> - This category is for content that is considered to be completely safe, free of any Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Abusive, Offensive or Sensitive content.<br>\nThis is typically content that is safe for viewing in the presence of family, co-workers, public audiences or in any other setting.<br>\nSimilar Worlds makes an extra effort to thoroughly screen (algorithmically) content entering this category, so that it is likely safe for even the youngest users of our website.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Non-Adult</b> - This category is for content that is considered to be safe, free of Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Abusive, Offensive or Sensitive content.<br>\nThis is typically content that is safe for viewing in most settings.\nContent falling in this category must not be obviously Mature or Inappropriate in nature.<br>\nAs Similar Worlds allows for freedom of speech, opinion and expression, we attempt to strike some balance as to not over-aggressively filter everything appearing in this category.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Mildly Adult</b> - This category is for content which may be of \"Mildly Adult\" nature.<br>\nThis includes very slightly/mildly Adult/Mature, very slightly/mildly Inappropriate, very slightly/mildly Offensive or very slightly/mildly Sensitive content.<br>\nExample: Mildly Adult Language, Jokes, References, Imagery.<br>\nContent within this category may be considered as \"PG 13\" by today's standards, but not at/above \"18+\" / \"R\" rating.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Adult</b> - This category is for content which may be of \"Adult\" nature.<br>\nThis includes Adult/Mature, Inappropriate, Offensive or Sensitive content.<br>\nExample: Adult Language, Jokes, References, Imagery (not including nudity).<br>\nContent within this category is not suitable for minors.<br>\nPlease note that we do not allow the posting of Nudity, Extremely Offensive or Abusive content, within areas of SW that are labelled as \"Adult\".</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Although we allow freedom of speech, opinion and expression, users are not permitted to bully, abuse, harass or offend other members.</b> You can also select the options below: <ul>\n<li>\n<b>Nudity</b> - This category is for content which may contain imagery of mild \"Nudity\".<br>\nThis includes any image, video or other media content which displays or depicts mild Nudity.<br>\nPlease note that we do not allow images that are focused or zoomed in to genital areas, or where sexually explicit acts are involved.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Fetish</b> - This category is for content which may be considered to be a \"Fetish\".<br>\nWhile the definition and categorization of \"Fetish\" is very broad, users are expected to use their discretion, while also keeping in line with the other Terms of Service of Similar Worlds.<br>\nPlease note that this category is NOT allowed the posting of highly Explicit, highly Violent or highly Revolting content.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Sensitive</b> - This category is for content which may be of \"Sensitive\" nature.<br>\nThis includes content that may be visually or mentally disturbing to viewers.<br>\nExample: Content that is Mildly Gruesome, Revolting or Violent.<br>\nPlease note

cases of actual abusive, spam, suicide or illegal activity.\nVIP Membership, Payment &amp.\nRenewal Terms of Service\n<ol>\n<li>You can upgrade your account to VIP by paying or subscribing to one of the packages available.\nIf you already have an active VIP subscription and purchase VIP again, the new VIP time you purchase will be added/accumulated onto your existing VIP time.</li>\n<li>You may

from an account to another is possible, by requesting this via an email or ticket to us, only in the following conditions: <ul>\n<li>You intended to gift the VIP to someone else, but you forgot to choose the recipient at the time of purchasing, and you contacted us within a few hours after purchasing.\nor</li>\n<li>You want to transfer the remaining VIP time to another account of yours because you used the wrong account to purchase, and you contacted us within a few hours after purchasing.</li>\n<li>Due to the variance between pricing rates, you cannot split a VIP purchase in smaller subscriptions, to be distributed between multiple accounts.\nIf we transfer VIP membership between accounts, we will transfer the purchased package in full, to the target account, without possibility of splitting.</li>\n</ul> Disputes\nIf anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions, content or information on Similar Worlds, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all
