circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What we may need from you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal information (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Time limit to respond</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> 10.\nGlossary\n<p>\n<strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience.\nWe make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal information for our legitimate interests.\nWe do not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).\nYou can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your information where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comply with a legal obligation </strong>means processing your personal information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent</strong> means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signify agreement to the processing of personal information relating to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service providers acting as processors who provide IT, payment processing, analytics, and system administration services.\nPlease refer to Crayon\u2019s list of Sub-Processors / Service

services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal information (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\").\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal information that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal information.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with applicable law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal information.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want us to establish the information's accuracy.</li>\n<li>Where our use of the information is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.</li>\n<li>Where you need us to hold the information even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>\n<li>You have objected to our use of your information, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal information to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal information.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product <ul>\n<li>Overview</li>\n<li>Competitive Intelligence</li>\n<li>Competitive

July 2020</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) are entered into by and between the \u201cCustomer\u201d listed on the Authorization Form attached hereto as Exhibit A (\u201cAuthorization Form\u201d) and Crayon, Inc.\n(\u201cCrayon\u201d) on the effective date, as listed on the Authorization Form (\u201cEffective Date\u201c).</p>\n<p>This Agreement governs Customer\u2019s access to and use of the websites and other online products and services (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d) provided by Crayon and described in the Authorization Form.\nThe primary functionality of the Services is to provide Customer with analysis and aggregation of data about certain companies that Customer wishes to monitor (the \u201cTargets\u201d) and to provide Customer, and its Authorized Users (as defined below) with actionable insights.\nThe data made available by Crayon through the Services is publicly available information about the Targets (referred to in this Agreement as \u201cThird Party Materials\u201d).\nCrayon does not control the actual content of the Third Party Materials to which the Services provide access and therefore takes no responsibility in relation to the Third Party Materials.\n\u201cAuthorized Users\u201d means individual users authorized by Customer to use the Services, including accessing Customer\u2019s account on the Services, and who Customer has supplied user identifications and passwords to, which may include Customer and its employees, consultants, contractors, agents, or other

credentials and promptly notify Crayon if it discovers or suspects that someone has used its or their usernames or passwords without authorization.\nCustomer and each Authorized User\u2019s username

also User Content.\nAuthorized Users will typically add User Content to the Services in order to enhance the experience of other Authorized Users.\nCommon examples of User Content include commenting on insights, uploading Customer-generated insights, and synthesizing insights into Customer summaries and positions such as battlecards.</p>\n<p>Customer and its Authorized Users may not create, post, store, send or share any User Content that violates this Agreement or for which it does not have all the rights necessary to grant Crayon the license described herein.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nExcept for the

law, whichever is less, computed and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid.\nFurther, in the event of any action by Crayon to collect any amount not paid when due, Customer will pay
