(1) (1) (a) GDPR, we will use your e-mail address to send you our newsletter on a regular basis.\nThe input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is subscribed.</p>\n<p>KGS informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers.\nThe enterprise\u2019s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject properly subscribes for the newsletter mailing.\nA confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter mailing, for legal reasons, in the so called double opt-in procedure.\nThis confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>\n<p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.\nThe collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.</p>\n<p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter.\nIn addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances.\nThere will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.\nThe subscription to our newsletter may be terminated or unsubscribed by the data subject at any time.\nThe consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for the newsletter mailing, may be revoked at any time free of charge.\nFor the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found at the bottom of each newsletter.\nIt is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on our website, or to communicate this to us in a different way, e.g.\nby e-mail or mail.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Applications and the application procedures</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We collect and process the personal data of applicants for the purpose of the processing of the application procedure.\nThe processing may also be carried out electronically.\nThis is the case, in particular, if an applicant submits corresponding application documents by e-mail or by means of a web form on the website to us.\nIf we conclude an employment contract with an applicant, the submitted data will be stored for the purpose of processing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements.\nIf no employment contract is concluded with the applicant by us, the application documents will be automatically erased six (6) months after notification of the refusal decision, provided that the applicant has not given consent for a longer storage of the application documents and no other legitimate interests of us are opposed to the erasure.\nThese processing operations are lawful because the reply to your application represent legitimate interests within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) (1) (f) GDPR.\nIf a contract is concluded after you have contacted us, the processing is also legal pursuant to Art.\n6 (1) (1) (b) GDPR.\nOther legitimate interest in this relation is, e.g.\na burden of proof in a procedure under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>d) The kurzgesagt shop</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Data

miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis.\nThis allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.\nBased on the embedded tracking pixel, KGS may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>\n<p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by us in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.\nThe legal basis is Art.\n6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR.\nThese personal data will not be passed on to third parties.\nData subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure.\nAfter a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by us.\nKGS automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Integration of social media</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the basis of Art.\n6 (1) (1) (a) GDPR we use the social networks YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Patreon, Reddit and B\u0113hance in order to make our website better known and to interact with our target groups.\nResponsibility for the data protection-compliant operation of these services is guaranteed by the respective provider.\nWe integrate these services exclusively via a link so that visitors to our website have the best possible control over their personal data.</p>\n<p>These social networks are operated exclusively by third parties, some of whom have their register office outside the E.U.\nor the EEA \u2013 there may therefore be no adequate level of data protection in accordance with the GDPR.\nThe browser plug-ins and links on our website are identified by logos or other references.\nWhen you visit our website, which contains such a browser plug-in, a connection is automatically established between your device (browser) and the servers of the respective social network.\nThis forwards the information that you have visited our website to the social network.\nIf you are logged in to the social network via your personal user account or during your visit to our website, your visit to our website will be assigned to your account.\nBy interacting with browser plug-ins or links, e.g.\nby pressing a \u201clike\u201d button or leaving a comment, this information is transmitted to the respective social network and stored there.\nThe allocation of the data to your account can therefore be prevented on the one hand by logging out of your account (of the respective social network) before visiting our website.\nOn the other hand, you can also completely prevent the loading of the respective plug-ins with an add-on for your browser, e.g.\nwith the script blocker \u201cNoScript\u201d
