explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.\n</p>\nWhat are cookies?\n<p>Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.\nThey are widely used to \u201cremember\u201d you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a \u201csession cookie\u201d) or for multiple repeat visits (using a \u201cpersistent cookie\u201d).\nThey ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.\nCookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as \u201cfirst party cookies\u201d), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (\u201cthird party cookies\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as \u201cweb beacons\u201d or \u201cpixels.\u201d These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies.\nThey are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way.\nAs a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.\n</p>\n<b>How we use cookies</b>\n<p>We use cookies for a number of different purposes.\nSome cookies are necessary for technical reasons.\nsome enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users.\nand some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks.\nSome of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d button on a post, for example).</p>\n<p>Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered WordPress.com user (so you don\u2019t have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.</p>\n<p>For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below.\n</p>\n<b>Where we place cookies</b>\n<p>We set cookies in a number of different locations across our services.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, and happy.tools).</li>\n<li>In the administrative dashboards of our websites, such as Calypso and wp-admin.</li>\n<li>On sites we host for our users.</li>\n<li>On sites that use our plugins (e.g.\nJetpack).</li>\n<li>In the emails we send.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Types of Cookie</b>\n<p>The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites and why we use them.\n</p>\n<b>Category of cookies</b>\n<b>Why we use these cookies</b> Required\nThese cookies are essential for our websites and services to perform basic functions and are necessary for us to operate certain features.\nThese include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account-related functions, store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location, and ensure our services are operating properly.\nAnalytics and Performance\nThese cookies allow us to optimize performance by collecting information on how users interact with our websites, including which pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data.\nWe use these details to improve how our websites function and to understand how users interact with them.\nAdvertising\nThese cookies are set by us and our advertising partners to provide you with relevant content and to understand that content\u2019s effectiveness.\nThey may be used to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites to predict your preferences and to display more relevant advertisements to you.\nThese cookies also allow a profile to be built about you and your interests and enable personalized ads to be shown to you based on your profile.\nUser Sites\n<p>In addition to the cookies set on our own sites, we utilize cookies for our Site Stats feature.\nThis tallies the unique numbers of visitors to a site, as well as the number from specific geographic locations.\nA visitor is counted when we see a user or browser for the first time in a given period.</p>\nExamples\n<p>Below are examples of the cookies set by Automattic, with explanations of their purpose.\nSome of these cookies are set across our whole network, whereas some are specific to individual services (e.g.\nWordPress.com, Longreads, etc).\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, but rather aims to be representative.\nInformation about cookies that may be set by third parties, such as our ads partners, is below.&nbsp;Additionally, we occasionally set referrer cookies on Jetpack connected sites, using WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>In addition, people and companies that use our services to publish or host their own sites may place additional cookies.\nWe provide more

or sites that use our services.</p>\nAdvertisements from Third Parties Through Automattic\u2019s Ads Program\n<p>Our mission is to democratize publishing.\nSo that we can offer free access to create a website using WordPress.com, we show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites.\nOur users may also choose to place ads on their site through our ads program.\nAdditionally, we also show ads from our ads program on some of our own websites (e.g.\nlongreads.com), and in emails.</p>\n<p>We operate our ads program in partnership with third party vendors.\nAs part of the operation of our ads program, we use cookies to collect certain information.\nAdvertising cookies enable us and our partners to serve ads and to personalize those ads based on information like visits to our sites and other sites on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Below is a representative list of our advertising program partners, along with information on the cookies that that each partner sets.&nbsp;The partners we work with change from time to time, and this is not an exhaustive list.\nYour choices to control cookies related to our ads program are described below.</p>\n<b>Partner</b>\n<b>Cookie Info</b>

our users may set additional cookies (such as Google Analytics), depending on the features they have chosen to enable or the plugins they have installed.</p>\nControlling Cookies\n<p>Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set.\nMost browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored \u2013 either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins.\nIf you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly.</p>\n<p>To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org.\nFor more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising you may visit the following sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>networkadvertising.org</li>\n<li>optout.aboutads.info&nbsp;</li>\n<li>youradchoices.com</li>\n<li>youronlinechoices.eu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit tracking.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some analytics services we use, which place their own cookies or web tags on your browser, offer their own opt out choices.\nFor example, you can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google\u2019s opt-out browser add-on, from Hotjar by using the Do Not Track header, and from Nielsen by clicking the opt out link found within Nielsen\u2019s Privacy Statement.</p>\nOur Internal Analytics Tool\n<p>In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards.\n</p>\n<p>We call each one of these actions an \u201cevent.\u201d Analytics events are attached to your WordPress.com account and are handled via a first party system that Automattic owns and maintains.\nIn general, we record the following data for each event: IP address, WordPress.com user ID and username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (for sites not hosted on WordPress.com), user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code.</p>\n<p>We use this information to improve our products, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>You may opt out of our analytics program through your user settings.\nBy doing so, you won\u2019t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nNote that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track \u2013 for example, if you publish a post, we will still have record of that (don\u2019t worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For our Simplenote Users:</strong>\n</em> We use our first party analytics tool in Simplenote to help us better understand how Simplenote is used and improve the app for our users.\nYou may opt-out through your privacy settings in the app.\nBy doing so, you won\u2019t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out.\nOne more thing\u2013For Simplenote users who log onto Simplenote using their WordPress.com login, if you\u2019d like to opt-out of our analytics tool on Simplenote, you\u2019ll also need to opt out on the Simplenote app\u2013not on your WP.COM Account Privacy Settings.</p>\nConsent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites\n<p>You may see a \u201ccookie banner\u201d on our websites and dashboards.\nIf you are visiting one of our sites from the EU, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept.\nWhen you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site you are visiting and on our other websites, dashboards, and services, which we use to show you advertisements about our various Automattic products.\nWe\u2019ll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.</p>\n<b>Consent and Choices for Advertisements on Our Users\u2019 Sites Through Our Ads Program</b>\n<p>You may see a \u201ccookie banner\u201d on our users\u2019 websites, particularly if you are in the European Union.\nIf so, then our ad program does not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you accept.\n</p>\n<p>When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set third party advertising cookies in order to show you personalized ads on the website you are visiting and, if you are visiting a site in the WordPress.com network, on all websites within that network of sites.\nYou\u2019ll know that a site is in the WordPress.com network because it will have a WordPress.com subdomain (e.g., example.wordpress.com).\nFor other sites that participate in our ads program, your consent is only for personalized ads on the specific site you are visiting.</p>\n<p>\n<em>For visitors to sites in the WordPress.com network</em>:</p>\n<p>You can manage your privacy choices for third party advertising cookies for sites in the WordPress.com network by clicking \u201cLearn More\u201d on the banner, which will bring up our consent management platform (CMP).\nYou can also adjust your settings for sites in the WordPress.com network at any time by clicking on the \u201cPrivacy\u201d link displayed beneath every ad.</p>\n<p>In March 2021 we began rolling out a new CMP to some of our users as part of our transition to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe\u2019s Transparency and Consent Framework, which we will participate in as both a CMP provider and as a vendor (framework identification number 496).\nOur new CMP complies with the the framework\u2019s Specifications and Policies, and honors the choices you make using the IAB\u2019s tools.\nWithin the CMP we list as partners all the vendors that participate in the IAB\u2019s Framework.\nWe don\u2019t work with all of these vendors, but our ad partners listed above might, so we want you to give you the choice to deactivate them.\n(This is also why the list in our CMP is longer than you\u2019d expect!).</p>\n<p>\n<em>Other Choices:</em>\n</p>\n<p>We also set a cookie to help us understand how visitors engage with websites that participate in our ad program.\nVisitors may opt out of our use of this information by visiting this link (the opt-out will be processed immediately with no confirmation step).\nWhen you opt out, we replace the unique value for that cookie with an opt-out value.\nThe opt-out works across all websites in our ads program.\nIf you have opted out by accident&nbsp.\nor wish to opt back in, you may do so by visiting this link.\nPlease note that this option is browser-specific, so if you use a different device or browser or clear your cookies, then you will need to repeat the process.</p>\nContact Us\n<p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies, you can find the most relevant contact details in our Privacy Policy.</p>\nShare this:<ul>\n<li>Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)</li>\n<li>Click to share on

principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.</li>\n<li>We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.</li>\n<li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on your website is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.</li>\n<li>We help protect you from overreaching government demands for your personal information.</li>\n<li>We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below is our Privacy Policy, which incorporates and clarifies these principles.</p>\nWho We Are and What This Policy Covers\n<p>Howdy! We are the folks behind a variety of products and services designed to allow anyone \u2014 from bloggers, to photographers, small business owners, and enterprises \u2014 to take full advantage of the power and promise of the open web.\nOur mission is to democratize publishing and commerce so that anyone with a story can tell it, and anyone can turn their great idea into a livelihood.\nWe believe in powering the open internet with code that is open source and are proud to say that the vast majority of our work is available under the General Public License (\u201cGPL\u201d).\nUnlike most other services, because our GPL code is public, you can actually download and take a look at that code to see how it works.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com,

Policy we\u2019ll refer to our websites, mobile applications, and other products and services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d And if you\u2019d like to learn more about which Automattic company is the controller of information about you, take a look at the section below on Controllers and Responsible Companies.</p>\n<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services, like Tumblr, that have a separate privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>\nCreative Commons Sharealike License\n<p>We\u2019ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license.\nYou can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on GitHub.\nYou\u2019re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use.\nJust make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices.\nIf you do use it, we\u2019d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.</p>\nInformation We Collect\n<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so \u2014 for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>\n<p>We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p>\n<em>Information You Provide to Us</em>\n<p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic account information: </strong>We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\nYou may provide us with more information \u2014 like your address and other information you want to share \u2014 but we don\u2019t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public profile information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\nFor example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an \u201cAbout Me\u201d description.\nYour public profile information is just that \u2014 public \u2014 so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment and contact information: </strong>If you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we\u2019ll collect information to process those payments and contact you.\nIf you buy something from us \u2014 a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a custom domain, some Longreads swag \u2014 or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you\u2019ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information.\nWe also keep a record of the purchases you\u2019ve made.\nIf you use our Ecommerce Services (including Store on WordPress.com, WooCommerce Shipping &amp.\nTax, and WooCommerce Payments), you\u2019ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL.\nYou may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.\nIf you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like WordAds, you\u2019ll provide some additional information \u2014 for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Business Profile: </b>Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile.\nFor example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us.\nIf you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service\u2019s features.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content information: </strong>You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Credentials: </strong>Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).\nJetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications with us (hi there!): </strong>You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads.\nWhen you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Job applicant information:</strong> If you apply for a job with us \u2014 awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification as part of the application process.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Information We Collect Automatically</i>\n<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services \u2014 for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services \u2014 in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted \u201c[title of post]\u201d at [time/date]).\nOur WooCommerce Usage Tracker also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers.\nWe also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our Admin Bar and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.\nWe may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system\u2019s permissions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stored information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps.\nWe access this stored information through your device operating system\u2019s permissions.\nFor example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device\u2019s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interactions with other users\u2019 sites:</strong> We collect some information about your interactions with other users\u2019 sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your \u201cLikes\u201d and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you.\nAs another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from cookies &amp.\nother technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails.\nAutomattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.\nFor more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Information We Collect from Other Sources</i>\n<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature, we\u2019ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.\nAs another example, if you use WooCommerce Payments, we\u2019ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>\n<p>Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!).\nWe use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.</p>\nHow and Why We Use Information\n<i>Purposes for Using Information</i>\n<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer

will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To place and manage ads in our advertising program.</strong> For example, to place ads on our users\u2019 sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting security incidents.\ndetecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.\nfighting spam.\ncomplying with our legal obligations.\nand protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Automattic.\ntexting you to verify your payment.\nor calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you.\nIf you don\u2019t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time.\n(If you opt out, we\u2019ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To recruit and hire new Automatticians.</strong> For example, by evaluating job applicants and communicating with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Legal Bases for Collecting

Policy.</p>\nSharing Information\n<i>How We Share Information</i>\n<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.\nThese are spelled out below, as well as in the section called Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf.\nWe require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site.\nThis includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooCommerce Payments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic).\nthose that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services).\nthose that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).\nthose that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams).\nother third-party tools that help us manage operations.\nand companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you.\nWe require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.\nOther vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our Cookie Policy).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.\nFor more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our Legal Guidelines.\nAdditionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\u2019 (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies.\nFor example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers.\nPlease see our Domain Registrations and Privacy support document for more details.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large.\nFor example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nIf any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\nFor example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Site owners: </strong>If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site.\nFor example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.\nOr if you make a payment (like via the Payments feature) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site.<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users\u2019 data.\nWe aren\u2019t a data broker, we don\u2019t sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don\u2019t sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>\n<p>We show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites as well as some of our own, and the revenue they generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn\u2019t become an obstacle to having a voice.</p>\n<p>Under a new California law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), some personalized advertising you see online and on our services might be considered a \u201csale\u201d even though we don\u2019t share information that identifies you personally, like your name or email address, as part of our advertising program.</p>\n<p>You have choices about these ads, learn more about them and our ads program.</p>\n<i>Information Shared Publicly</i>\n<p>Information that you choose to make public is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 disclosed publicly.</p>\n<p>That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your \u201cLikes\u201d and comments on other websites are all available to others \u2014 and we hope they get a lot of views!</p>\n<p>For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven\u2019t uploaded one, is your <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>R</strong>ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar \u2014 get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and \u201cLikes\u201d that you make on other users\u2019 websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nYour Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, \u201cLikes,\u201d and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.</p>\n<p>We also provide a \u201cFirehose\u201d stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly.\nFind out more about opting out of the Firehose for WordPress.com and Jetpack sites.\nPublic information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>\n<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>\nHow Long We Keep Information\n<p>We generally discard information about you when it\u2019s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it \u2014 described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information \u2014 and we\u2019re not legally required to keep it.</p>\n<p>For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic\u2019s websites, like the visitor\u2019s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days.\nWe retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic\u2019s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>\n<p>As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun.\nAfter the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>\nSecurity\n<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.\nWe monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>\n<p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication.</p>\nChoices\n<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information.\nPlease keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services \u2014 for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge \u2014 may not be accessible.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit access to information on your mobile device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps.\nIf you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us.\nJust follow the instructions in those communications or let us know.\nIf you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, Automattic does not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals across all of our Services.\nHowever, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic\u2019s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt out of our internal analytics program:</strong> You can do this through your user settings.\nBy opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you\u2019re logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nFor more information, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Close your account:</strong> While we\u2019d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services.\n(Here are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above \u2014 for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>\n</ul>\nYour Rights\n<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the \u201cGDPR\u201d), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>\n<em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em>\n<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>\n<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>\n<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>\n<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data.\nand</li>\n<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>\n<em>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</em>\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.</p>\n<p>The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the \u201ccategories\u201d of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is.\nIn the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>\n<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>\n<li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);</li>\n<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);</li>\n<li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>\n<li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);</li>\n<li>Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application).\nand</li>\n<li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above.</p>\n<p>We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section.\nAnd we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section.</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li>\n<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>\n<li>Opt out of any sale of personal information.\nand</li>\n<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n<em>The CCPA &amp.\nPersonalized Advertising in Our Ads Program</em>\n</strong>\n<p>Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible.\nWe show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn\u2019t become an obstacle to having a voice.\nOur ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites.\nAs part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users\u2019 sites and some of our own.</p>\n<p>The personal information we share includes online identifiers.\ninternet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address).\nand geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address).\nThese disclosures may be considered a \u201csale\u201d of information under the CCPA.\nWe do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information.\nWe don\u2019t knowingly sell personal information of those under 16.\nLearn how you can opt out by going to California: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>\n<em>Contacting Us About These Rights</em>\n<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren\u2019t able to or you\u2019d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to \u201cHow to Reach Us\u201d to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>\n<p>When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we\u2019ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything.\nFor example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account.\nYou can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization.\nWe may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>\nControllers and Responsible Companies\n<p>Automattic\u2019s Services are worldwide.\nDifferent Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.</p>\n<p>Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data.\nGenerally, the \u201ccontroller\u201d is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you

provide analytics services via our Services.\nThese ad networks and analytics providers may set tracking technologies (like cookies) to collect information about your use of our Services and across other websites and online services.\nThese technologies allow these third parties to recognize your device to compile information about you or others who use your device.\nThis information allows us and other companies to, among other things, analyze and track usage, determine the popularity of certain content, and deliver ads that may be more targeted to your interests.\nPlease note this Privacy Policy only covers the collection of information by Automattic and does not cover the collection of information by any third-party advertisers or analytics providers.</p>\n<i>Third-Party Software and Services</i>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to use third-party plugins or embeds, WooCommerce Payments (powered by Stripe), WooCommerce extensions that enable services provided by third parties, or other third-party software or services, please keep in mind that interacting with them may mean providing information about yourself (or your site visitors) to those third parties.\nFor example, some third-party services may request or require access to your (yours, your visitors\u2019, or customers\u2019) data via a pixel or cookie.\nPlease note that if you use the third-party service or grant access, your data will be handled in accordance with the third party\u2019s privacy policy and practices.\nWe don\u2019t own or control these third parties, and they have their own rules about information collection, use, and sharing, which you should review before using the software or services.</p>\n<i>Visitors to Our Users\u2019 Websites</i>\n<p>We also process information about visitors to our users\u2019 websites, on behalf of our users and in accordance with our user agreements.\nPlease note that our processing of that information on behalf of our users for their websites isn\u2019t covered by this Privacy Policy.\nWe encourage our users to post a privacy policy that accurately describes their practices on data collection, use, and sharing of personal information.\nIf you\u2019d like, you can also read more about the data we collect on behalf of our users in our Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>Users control the content posted on their sites, so any disputes regarding

Policy Changes\n<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Automattic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time.\nAutomattic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any

Content you download, copy, purchase, or use.</p>\n5.\nFees, Payment, and Renewal\na.\nAutomattic Fees\n<p>\n<strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of our Services are offered for a fee, like WordPress.com plans, WooCommerce themes or extensions, Jetpack plans, Jetpack CRM bundles, VaultPress plans, Happy Tools, MailPoet plans, the Payments feature, WooCommerce Payments, Email, and domain registration and renewal (collectively, \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\nBy using a Paid Service, you agree to pay the specified fees.\nDepending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees, recurring fees, or revenue-based fees.\nFor recurring fees, we\u2019ll bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually, or biennially) you select, on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.\nFor revenue-based fees \u2014 such as fees for the Payments feature \u2014 you pay us a percentage of the revenue your website generates.\nRevenue-based fees are ongoing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges (\u201cTaxes\u201d).\nYou\u2019re responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to your use of our Services, your payments, or your purchases.\nIf we\u2019re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees you\u2019ve paid or will pay, you\u2019re responsible for those Taxes, and we may collect payment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment.</strong> If your payment fails, Paid Services are otherwise not paid for or paid for on time (for example, if you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of fees for Paid Services), or we suspect a payment is fraudulent, we may immediately cancel or revoke your access to Paid Services without notice to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed.\nThis means that unless you cancel a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to use any payment mechanism we have on record for you, like credit cards or PayPal, or invoice you (in which case payment is due within 15 days) to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes.\nBy default, your Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period, so for example, if you purchase a one-year subscription to a WordPress.com plan, you\u2019ll be charged each year for access for another 12-month period.\nWe may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure pesky billing issues don\u2019t inadvertently disrupt your access to our Services.\nThe date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed.\nIf you\u2019ve purchased access to multiple services, you may have multiple renewal dates.</p>\n<p>You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for WordPress.com Paid Services by visiting your Manage Purchases page.\nFor more information about how WordPress.com subscriptions work, please see our Manage Purchases, Renewals &amp.\nCancellations support page.</p>\n<p>You can view your renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for WooCommerce Paid Services by visiting your My Subscriptions page.\nFor more information about how WooCommerce subscriptions work, please see our FAQs about WooCommerce.com subscriptions.</p>\n<p>To review renewal dates and manage subscriptions for any other Paid Services, please consult the respective Service\u2019s website or contact the support team.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to check your email (including in spam or other filters) for any reminder emails we might send you before your Paid Services renew.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> You can manage and cancel your Paid Services at the respective Service\u2019s website.\nFor example, you can manage all of your WordPress.com plans through your WordPress.com Manage Purchases page.\nTo cancel a WordPress.com plan, go to your Manage Purchases page, click on the plan you want to cancel, then follow the instructions to cancel the subscription or turn off auto-renew.</p>\n<p>For WooCommerce Paid Services, you can turn off auto-renew for each active subscription at your My Subscriptions page.</p>\n<p>If auto-renew is successfully turned off, you\u2019ll see the date on which your subscription expires.\nIf you have multiple Paid Services to cancel, repeat this process for each subscription.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees and Changes.</strong> We may change our fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law.\nThis means that we may change our fees going forward, start charging fees for Services that were previously free, or remove or update features or functionality that were previously included in the fees.\nIf you don\u2019t agree with the changes, you must cancel your Paid Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No-Show Policy.</strong> We may have a \u201cno-show policy\u201d for some Paid Services that require your participation (for example, our Quick Start sessions).\nFor instance, this may mean that if you don\u2019t show up or are late for a scheduled session, you\u2019ll still be charged and won\u2019t be entitled to a refund.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Refunds.</strong> We may have a refund policy for some of our Paid Services, and we\u2019ll also provide refunds if required by law.\nIn all other cases, there are no refunds and all payments are final.</p>\nb.\nFees Collected by Website Owners\n<p>\n<strong>Fees Paid to Websites or Website Owners.</strong> Website owners can sell items (goods, content, services, etc.), offer subscriptions for their websites at specific price points and intervals, or simply collect payments.\nWe\u2019re not involved in a website\u2019s subscription details or store operations (including the quality, timing, pricing, or legality of what may or may not be included in exchange for payment, or any goods or services purchased).\nIf you buy items or subscriptions from a website, you\u2019re making the purchase directly from the website owner, and they\u2019re solely responsible for the items sold.\nPlease contact the website owner if you have any questions or complaints.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> Any recurring payments you make to a website owner (like a website subscription) are automatically renewed.\nThis means that unless you or the website owner cancels your website subscription before the end of the applicable renewal period, it will automatically renew.\nYour recurring payments are renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period.\nFor example, if you select an annually renewing website subscription, you\u2019ll be automatically charged by the website owner once each year.\nYou can view the renewal dates for your website subscriptions on your Other Site Payments page.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal of Website Subscriptions.</strong> You can manage and cancel your website subscriptions as described here at your Other Site Payments page.\nClick on the payment you want to cancel and follow the instructions.\nRepeat this process for each website subscription you want to cancel.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Refunds.</strong> We\u2019re not responsible for refunding fees paid to a website owner because those transactions are between website owners and their users.\nIf you\u2019d like to request a refund, please contact the website owner.\nIf you have a complaint regarding a website owner, you can contact us.</p>\n6.\nFeedback\n<p>We love hearing from you and are always looking to improve our Services.\nWhen you share comments, ideas, or feedback with us, you agree that we\u2019re free to use them without any restriction or compensation to you.</p>\n7.\nGeneral Representation and Warranty\n<p>Our mission is to make the web a better place, and our Services are designed to give you control and ownership over your websites.\nWe encourage you to express yourself freely, subject to a few requirements.\nIn particular, you represent and warrant that your use of our Services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will be in strict accordance with the Agreement;</li>\n<li>Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations (including, without limitation, all applicable laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content, privacy, data protection, the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside, the use or provision of financial services, notification and consumer protection, unfair competition, and false advertising);</li>\n<li>Will not be for any unlawful purposes, to publish illegal content, or in furtherance of illegal activities;</li>\n<li>Will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of Automattic or any third party;</li>\n<li>Will not overburden or interfere with our systems or impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, as determined by us in our sole discretion;</li>\n<li>Will not disclose the personal information of others;</li>\n<li>Will not be used to send spam or bulk unsolicited messages;</li>\n<li>Will not interfere with, disrupt, or attack any service or network;</li>\n<li>Will not be used to create, distribute, or enable material that is, facilitates, or operates in conjunction with, malware, spyware, adware, or other malicious programs or code;</li>\n<li>Will not involve reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, deciphering, or otherwise attempting to derive the source code for the Services or any related technology that is not open source.\nand</li>\n<li>Will not involve renting, leasing, loaning, selling, or reselling the Services or related data without our consent.</li>\n</ul>\n8.\nSpecific Service Terms\na.\nWordPress.com Websites and Accounts\n<p>WordPress.com enables you to create beautiful websites and blogs, and we would love for you to use it.\nA WordPress.com account also allows you to sign into some of our other Services.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com\u2019s basic service is free, and we offer paid plans that add advanced features like a custom domain name, extra storage, and access to premium themes.\nWe don\u2019t own your content, and you retain all ownership rights you have in the content you post to your website.\nHowever, be responsible in what you publish.\nIn particular, make sure that nothing prohibited (like spam, viruses, or serious threats of violence) appears on your website.</p>\n<p>If you find a WordPress.com website that you believe violates these Terms, please let us know.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your WordPress.com Website\u2019s URL.</strong> If you create a website on WordPress.com, you get free use of an Automattic-owned subdomain, like yourgroovysite.wordpress.com or mollys.food.blog.\nYou must not engage in \u201cdomain squatting,\u201d claim an unreasonable number of subdomains (as determined by us), or sell access to any subdomains.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>License.</strong> By uploading or sharing Content, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, adapt, publicly display, and publish the Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving our products and Services and promoting your website.\nThis license also allows us to make any publicly-posted Content available to select third parties (through Firehose, for example) so that these third parties can analyze and distribute (but not publicly display) the Content through their services.\nYou also give other WordPress.com users permission to share your Content on other WordPress.com websites and add their own Content to it (aka to \u201creblog\u201d your Content), so long as they use only a portion of your post and they give you credit as the original author by linking back to your website, which the reblogging function on WordPress.com does automatically.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Removing Content.</strong> If you delete Content, we\u2019ll use reasonable efforts to remove it from public view (or in the case of a private website, from view by the authorized visitors) on WordPress.com, but you acknowledge that cached versions of the Content or references to the Content may not be immediately unavailable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web Traffic.</strong> We may use a third-party service to measure WordPress.com\u2019s audience and usage.\nBy having your website on WordPress.com, you agree to assign the traffic for your website to Automattic, and you authorize us to sign a Traffic Assignment Letter on your behalf.\nThis means that your website\u2019s traffic may be included under Automattic, your website may not receive credit for traffic in the respective reports, and you must not assign your website\u2019s traffic to any other party.\nIf we require additional documentation to verify ownership of your website or domain name, you agree to make reasonable efforts to provide it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> Your Content and conduct must not violate the WordPress.com User Guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HTTPS.</strong> We offer free HTTPS on all WordPress.com websites by default, including those using custom domains, via Let\u2019s Encrypt.\nBy signing up and using a custom domain on WordPress.com, you authorize us to act on the domain name registrant\u2019s behalf (by requesting the necessary certificates, for example) for the sole purpose of providing HTTPS on your website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertisements.</strong> We may display advertisements on your website unless you have purchased a plan that includes the removal of ads.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Attribution.</strong> We may display attribution text or links in your website footer or toolbar, noting that your website is powered by WordPress.com or attributing the creator of your theme, for example.\nFor more details about these attributions, and under which circumstances (if any) you may alter or remove them, please see our Footer Credit Options support

features offered via WooCommerce, WooCommerce Shipping &amp.\nTax, WordPress.com, and Jetpack that enable you to sell items (goods, content, services, etc.) or receive payments on your website, like WooCommerce Payments, Store, the Payments feature, and the Pay with PayPal block (collectively, \u201cEcommerce Services\u201d).</p>\n<p>If you use Ecommerce Services, the terms in this subsection apply, along with the terms for any underlying Service that you use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your responsibilities.</strong> You have control over your store, and with great power comes great responsibility.\nYou\u2019re solely responsible for all of your ecommerce activities, including managing subscriptions for your website, managing your store, all applicable taxes and fees, compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and compliance with any applicable laws (such as those relating to automatic renewal).\nAmong other things, this means that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We\u2019re not involved in your relationships or transactions with any customer or potential customer.</li>\n<li>You may only use Ecommerce Services for legitimate transactions with your customers.</li>\n<li>You must accurately communicate transaction details.\nset expectations appropriately.\nand fulfill all promises, representations, or warranties you\u2019ve made.\nFor example, if you\u2019d like to offer subscribers a new post each week for contributing to your site via Payments, but aren\u2019t sure if you\u2019ll be able to post that frequently, you should be clear that weekly posts are a goal and not a guarantee.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re responsible for the nature and quality of the products or services you provide, and for delivery, support, refunds, returns, providing any appropriate warnings and for any other ancillary services you provide to your customers.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re responsible for resolving all support questions, comments, and complaints, including chargebacks and pricing questions.\nYou must provide contact information so customers can contact you with questions or complaints.</li>\n<li>You must maintain a fair return, refund, cancellation, or adjustment policy, and clearly explain how customers can request a refund.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re responsible for acquiring appropriate consent to submit charges through WooCommerce Payments on your customers\u2019 behalf, giving customers confirmation or receipts for each charge, verifying customers\u2019 identities, and determining a customer\u2019s eligibility and authority to complete transactions.</li>\n<li>If you believe that a transaction may be erroneous or suspicious, you should research the transaction and, if necessary, contact your customer before fulfilling or completing the transaction.</li>\n<li>If you have transactions with individuals (i.e., consumers), you specifically agree to provide consumer disclosures required by law, and to not engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.</li>\n<li>You\u2019re financially liable for disputes (including chargebacks), refunds, reversals, or fines that arise from your use of Ecommerce Services.</li>\n<li>You must ensure that any information you provide about your business, products, and services is accurate, complete, and current.</li>\n<li>You agree to promptly notify us via email if you receive any inquiry or action from a government or regulatory agency (such as the Federal Trade Commission or a state Attorney General) relating to your transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Prohibited Uses.</strong> You may not use Ecommerce Services for any unlawful purposes.\nin furtherance of illegal activities.\nor in a manner that is unfair, deceptive, exposes us or customers to unreasonable risks, or does not disclose important terms of a transaction in advance.\nAmong other things, this means that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ecommerce Services cannot be used in or for the benefit of a country, organization, entity, or person embargoed or blocked by any government, including those on sanctions lists identified by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC).</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re using Ecommerce Services on WordPress.com, you must observe all WordPress.com User Guidelines and Store Guidelines.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re using Ecommerce Services to sell CBD and other hemp-derived products via WooCommerce, you must follow the WooCommerce Guidelines for CBD and Other Hemp-Derived Products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may terminate your access to our Services or force refunds (where possible) to your subscribers and customers without notice to you if we determine (in our sole discretion) that your use violates the Agreement, or if a payment processor or regulatory authority requires it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees and Negative Balances.</strong> In some cases, you pay us fees relating to the Ecommerce Services you use.\nFor example, the fee for the Payments feature is a percentage (which depends on your plan) of the revenue your website generates through the Payment feature, and when you use the feature, you authorize Stripe to direct payment of that percentage to us.\nAs another example, if you use WooCommerce Payments, there are transaction fees and dispute fees.\nPlease note that we have no obligation to reimburse or refund these revenue-based fees when you issue refunds to your subscribers or customers.</p>\n<p>If you have a negative account balance (for example because of fraud, chargebacks, or other operational issues) or we\u2019re obligated to pay or collect any fees relating to your ecommerce activities or your use of Ecommerce Services, you\u2019re responsible for those losses and fees, and we may collect payment for those losses and fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tax Calculations.</strong> You\u2019re responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your ecommerce activities and your use of Ecommerce Services.\nYou must collect, report, and/or pay the correct amounts to the appropriate authorities if applicable, and if needed, tell your customers about any Taxes they may be required to pay and issue appropriate invoices.\nWhile some Ecommerce Services allow you to include sales taxes in transactions \u2014 for example, tax calculations may be provided by TaxJar \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t rely solely on these features.\nWe work to keep our documents and tools up-to-date, but tax laws change rapidly.\nand we can\u2019t guarantee that tax calculations you receive through or in connection with our Services are complete and accurate.\nTax laws also differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may be interpreted differently by different authorities.\nWe recommend consulting with a tax professional for your specific tax situation to assess the tax rates you should charge.</p>\n<p>If we\u2019re obligated to pay or collect Taxes on your ecommerce activities or your use of Ecommerce Services, you\u2019re responsible for these Taxes, and we may collect payment for them from you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-Party Services.</strong> You may decide to use third-party services, like Stripe or PayPal to collect payment, TaxJar to calculate Taxes, or EasyPost to manage shipping.\nPlease note that WooCommerce Payments is powered by Stripe.\nIf you use WooCommerce Payments or any third-party services, some of your \u2014 and your customers\u2019 \u2014 data may be submitted directly to or passed to the respective third party, and the respective third party\u2019s terms of service, privacy policy, and other policies may apply.\nFor example, Payments requires a Stripe account to manage payments, and when you use Stripe, you agree to their terms and policies.\nPlease note that third-party services may also charge you fees to use or access their services, as Stripe does for Payments.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re not involved in these relationships, but may facilitate transactions or communication.\nFor example, we may, on your behalf, receive notices or forms relating to your Stripe account.</p>\n<p>Some of these third party services (like TaxJar, if you use Store) may be enabled by default, but you can disable them before launching your store if you don\u2019t want to use them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on WooCommerce Payments Specifically.</strong> As part of WooCommerce Payments, we may use certain third parties to fulfill our obligations to you, including integrating with payment processing third parties.\nYou may be subject to the terms and conditions of those third parties, and using WooCommerce Payments means you agree to comply with those terms and conditions.\nIn particular, you cannot use WooCommerce Payments to enable any person (including you) to benefit from restricted businesses or activities.\nIf we use another third party to fulfill these services, you authorize us to share your payment method information with an alternative third-party payment processor that is or will be integrated into WooCommerce Payments.</p>\n<p>We may refuse, condition, or suspend any transaction or account (including your use of WooCommerce Payments) if we believe you have violated this Agreement or that your activities or transactions expose you, us, or others to unacceptable risks, as determined by us in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>You authorize us to share data relating to WooCommerce Payments with the applicable payment processing third party for their use in accordance with their privacy policy.\nPlease refer to our privacy policy for details on how we otherwise collect, use, and disclose data made available to us as part of WooCommerce Payments.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on Shipping Services Specifically.</strong> Our shipping Services allow you to check shipping rates or buy shipping labels from certain mailing services, like UPS, USPS, DHL, and Canada Post.\nWe\u2019re only an intermediary between you and these third parties.\nwe aren\u2019t involved in any way with your product or its shipment.\nWe also don\u2019t guarantee that the results you obtain from the use of these services (like rates, labels, or delivery timeframes) will be accurate or reliable.</p>\n<p>You\u2019re solely responsible for compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, including domestic and international shipping and customs regulations and any regulations imposed by the mailing service(s) you use.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use USPS postage, you need to comply with their shipping restrictions and mailing standards, among others.</li>\n<li>When using DHL\u2019s services, you are responsible for compliance with all applicable DHL rules and terms, such as the DHL Express Terms and Conditions of Carriage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, you\u2019re solely responsible for customs charges, import taxes or duties, and any other charges related to your shipments.\nIf we incur any charges as a result of your use of the shipping services, you agree to reimburse us for the full amount within 7 days.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may need to pay fees to the carrier directly, like if you use UPS shipping labels.\nIn other cases, you authorize us to charge you for the fees associated with each shipping label you create.\nEach fee will be charged separately to the payment methods you provide in your WordPress.com account, which you can view and manage as described on the Payments Methods support page.\nIf you have multiple payment methods, you can select which should be used for the shipping label service.\nIf we\u2019re unable to collect payment from you for these fees, you\u2019ll be responsible for payment within 7 days.\nplease contact us to make payment.</p>\n<p>Refunds for unused shipping labels must be requested (like so for USPS) in your store\u2019s wp-admin within 30 days of creating the label.\nDepending on your bank and the third party involved, it can take up to 45 days for your refund to be issued.\nIf you don\u2019t receive your refund within this time frame, please contact us.</p>\n<p>You may not transfer or sell postage and/or shipping labels to a third party.</p>\n9.\nCopyright Infringement and DMCA Policy\n<p>As we ask others to respect our intellectual property rights, we respect the intellectual property rights of
