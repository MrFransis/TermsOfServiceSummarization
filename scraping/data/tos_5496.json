will rely on are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent</strong> means agreement which must be freely given, specific, informed and be an unambiguous indication of your wishes by which you, by a statement

what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.\nThis is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>\n<p>You may receive marketing communications from us after you have requested information from us or become a member or if you provided our third party operator with your details when you have taken a survey and, in each case, you have opted-in to receiving that marketing.</p>\n<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>\n<p>In some limited circumstances, we may contact you about similar products and/or

collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.\nIf you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>\n<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>\n<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or

Parties such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Service providers acting as processors based in the UK who provide IT and system administration services.</li>\n<li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based in the UK who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>\n<li>HM Revenue &amp.\nCustoms,

third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.\nWe do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>\n8.INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS\n<p>Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Union (EU) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EU.</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>\n<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>\n<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EU.</p>\n9.DATA SECURITY\n<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.\nIn addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.\nThey will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>\n10.DATA RETENTION\n<p>\n<strong>How long will you use my personal data for?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>10.1 We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>\n<p>10.2 To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>\n<p>10.3 We will generally retain our members\u2019 data for a period of 6 (six) years after the membership has ended, to ensure that we are able to assist you should you have any questions or feedback in relation to your membership or our services or to protect, or defend our legal rights.</p>\n<p>10.4 Where we have processed your personal data to provide you with marketing communications with consent, we may contact you at least every twelve (12) months to ensure you are happy to continue receiving such communications.\nIf you tell us that you no longer wish to receive such communications, your personal data will be removed from our marketing lists (but will be added to a \u201cdo not contact\u201d list).</p>\n<p>10.5 Where we have processed your data for any other reason (such as where you have contacted us with a question in connection with services), subject to section 10.3, we will retain your data for twelve (12) months.</p>\n<p>10.6 In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see section 11.1.3 below for further information.</p>\n<p>10.7 In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>\n11.YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\n<p>11.1 Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.\nThese rights are detailed below:</p>\n<p>11.1.1 <strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d).\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>\n<p>11.1.2 <strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>\n<p>11.1.3 <strong>Request erasure of your personal data.</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>\n<p>11.1.4 <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>11.1.5 <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy.\n(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nor (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>\n<p>11.1.6 <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n<p>11.1.7 <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us directly.</p>\n11.2 No fee usually required\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>\n11.3 What we may need from you\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n11.4 Time limit to respond\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>\n12.\nCONTACT DETAILS AND COMPLAINTS\n<p>Our full details
