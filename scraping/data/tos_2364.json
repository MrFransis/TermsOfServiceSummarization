AFFECTS RIGHTS THAT YOU MAY OTHERWISE HAVE.\nIT PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF MOST DISPUTES THROUGH ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF COURT TRIALS AND CLASS ACTIONS.\nARBITRATION IS FINAL AND BINDING AND SUBJECT TO ONLY VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.\nTHIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nBinding Arbitration</strong>&nbsp;It is intended that this provision be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of our relationship.\nAny dispute or claim, including those against any of our subsidiary, parent or affiliate companies, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, our Privacy Policy or the Service or any equipment used in connection with the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration except that (1) you may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court, or (2) you or we may choose to pursue claims in court if the claims relate solely to the collection of any debts you owe to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nArbitration Procedures.</strong>&nbsp;You must first present any claim or dispute to us by contacting Customer Care to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute.\nYou may request arbitration if your claim or dispute has not been resolved within 90 days.\nThe arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Wireless Industry Arbitration Rules (\"WIA Rules\"), as modified by this Agreement.\nThe WIA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available upon request from the AAA online at www.adr.org.\nYou and we agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law.\nUnless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration will take place in the county seat for the county in which your billing address is located.\nAt either party's election, the arbitration shall be held telephonically.\nAn arbitrator may award any relief or damages (including injunctive or declaratory relief) that a court could award, except an arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what this Agreement provides and may not order relief on a consolidated, class wide or representative basis.\nIn any arbitration applying the WIA Rules applicable to large/complex cases, the Arbitrators must also apply the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the losing party may have the award reviewed in accordance with the review procedures set forth in the WIA Rules.\nJudgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.\nIf any portion of this arbitration clause is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nCosts of Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;For claims of less than $1,000, you will pay your share of the arbitration fees.\nFor claims over $1,000 but under $75,000, you will be obligated to pay your share of the arbitration fees, but no more than the equivalent court filing fee for a court action filed in the jurisdiction where your billing address is located.\nFor arbitrations in excess of $75,000, all administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided equally between you and us.\nIn all arbitrations, each party will bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D.\nWaiver of Class Actions.</strong>&nbsp;By this Agreement, both you and we are waiving certain rights to litigate disputes in court.\nYou and we both agree that any arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis and not on a consolidated, class wide or representative basis.\nIf for any reason this arbitration clause is deemed inapplicable or invalid, or to the extent this arbitration clause allows for litigation of disputes in court, you and we both waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any right to pursue any claims on a class or consolidated basis or in a representative capacity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E.\nLimitations Period.</strong>&nbsp;Any arbitration or legal action with respect to any and all claims or causes of action related to or arising out of this Agreement must be brought within two years after the cause of action arises, or within the applicable statutory period of time, whichever is shorter.\nThis limitation period does not apply to any given cause of action when the statutory limitations period for that cause of action cannot be waived, restricted or otherwise limited by you.</p> VI.\nMISCELLANEOUS <p>Not all plans or Services are available for purchase or use in all sales channels, in all areas or with all devices.\nCompany is not responsible for loss or disclosure of any sensitive information you transmit.\nCompany\u2019s wireless services are not equivalent to landline Internet.\nCompany is not responsible for nonproprietary

only be amended as described in this Agreement.\nThis Agreement supersedes any inconsistent or additional representations made to you by any of our representatives, agents or dealers.\nIf any part of this Agreement is found invalid, the balance of the Agreement remains enforceable.\nIf, at any time, we do not enforce any right or remedy available under this Agreement, that failure is not a waiver of our right to enforce the right or remedy at a later time.\nCopied, microfiche, scanned or other duplicate or electronic images of this Agreement are admissible for all purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E.\nGoverning Laws.</strong> This Agreement is subject to applicable federal laws, federal or state tariffs, if any and the laws of the state associated with the

enter into this Agreement, and that you are not aware of any disability that would prevent you from entering into this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G.\nResale.</strong>&nbsp;Resale of our Service is permitted solely if you have advance written permission from us to do so.\nIf you are purchasing Service for resale pursuant to such written permission, you agree to remit the appropriate taxes and/or

acknowledge that Company is neither collecting nor remitting any telecommunications taxes or fees for such purchases.\nIf it is determined that you resold our Service but did not remit taxes or fees to the appropriate taxation or regulatory body, respectively, we reserve the right to bill you in arrears for any taxes and/or fees which should have been collected and remitted.</p>
