are entered into by and between FingerprintJS, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\u201c<strong>FingerprintJS</strong>\u201d), and the customer identified during Onboarding (\u201c<strong>Customer</strong>\u201d).\n\u201c<strong>Onboarding</strong>\u201d means the process by which Customer procures from FingerprintJS a subscription to use the Service through a self-service sign-up process made available on FingerprintJS\u2019s website.\nThese Terms and any terms agreed-to during Onboarding are collectively referred to herein as the \u201c<strong>Agreement</strong>\u201d.\nBy accessing or using the Service (as defined below) or clicking a button or checking a box marked \u201cSubmit\u201d, \u201cI Agree\u201d, \u201cI Accept\u201d, or something similar, or by otherwise affirmatively manifesting assent to this Agreement, Customer signifies that Customer has read, understood, and agrees to be bound by this Agreement as of Customer\u2019s completion of Onboarding (such date, the \u201c<strong>Effective Date</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>FingerprintJS Service.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Subscription.\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in each case solely during the Subscription Term: (a) FingerprintJS hereby grants Customer a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 13.i) right and license to install the Agent on the Customer Website solely as necessary to use the Service in accordance with the Documentation.\nand (b) Customer and its Users may remotely access the Dashboard.\nSuch use is limited to Customer's internal use.\nCustomer and each User must keep Credentials confidential and not share them with anyone else.\nCustomer is responsible for (i) its Users\u2019 compliance with this Agreement and actions taken through their Credentials and (ii) disabling access to the Service by any User who is no longer an employee of Customer.\n</li>\n<li>Restrictions.\nCustomer shall not use the Service for any purposes beyond the scope of the access granted in this Agreement.\nCustomer shall not at any time, directly or indirectly (and shall not allow and third party to): (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Service or any component thereof.\n(b) rent, lease, lend, sell, license, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Service or any component thereof.\n(c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt

use commercially reasonable efforts to respond in a timely manner to support tickets sent by Customer to support@fingerprintjs.com.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Rights.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Visitor Data.\n<ol>\n<li>License Grant.\nCustomer grants FingerprintJS a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except in compliance with Section 13.i) right and license to: (i) use, copy, store, transmit, display, modify and create derivative works of Visitor Data as necessary to provide the Service to Customer under this Agreement and as otherwise described in the Privacy policy.\nand (ii) aggregate the Visitor Data with other data in a de-identified form and may use such derived data for any lawful purpose both during and after the Subscription Term.</li>\n<li>Data Processing.\nTo the extent FingerprintJS processes any Personal Information contained in the Visitor Data, FingerprintJS will process such Personal Information solely under the instruction of and on behalf of Customer.\nIf Customer is established in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, or if any Personal Information contained in the Visitor Data otherwise falls within the scope of the European Data Privacy Legislation, FingerprintJS will process any such Personal Information in accordance with FingerprintJS\u2019s GDPR data processing addendum, which will be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and can be accessed at https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/dpa-gdpr (as modified from time to time).\nIf Customer is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act and its implementing regulations (\u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d) and the Personal Information includes Personal Information of California residents, FingerprintJS will process any such Personal Information in accordance with FingerprintJS\u2019s CCPA data processing addendum, which will be incorporated by reference into this Agreement and can be accessed at https://dev.fingerprintjs.com/docs/dpa-ccpa (as modified from time to time).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the parties agree in writing to use a different data processing addendum, such data processing addendum will apply in lieu of either of the foregoing data processing addenda.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Usage Data.\nFingerprintJS may collect Usage Data and use it to operate, improve and support the Service and for other lawful business practices, such as analytics, benchmarking and reports.\nHowever, FingerprintJS will not disclose Usage Data to third parties, including in benchmarks or reports, unless it has been (a) de-identified so that it does not individually identify Customer, its Users or any other person and (b) aggregated with usage data across other FingerprintJS customers.</li>\n<li>Security.\nFingerprintJS uses reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect the Service and Visitor Data.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer Obligations</strong>.\nCustomer (a) is solely responsible for its Visitor Data (including its content) and compliance with all Applicable Laws in its use of the Service and (b) represents and warrants that it has made all necessary disclosures and obtained all necessary consents required for its submission of data and granting of rights to FingerprintJS under this Agreement without violating or infringing any third-party intellectual property or privacy rights or Customer or third-party terms of service or privacy policies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Commercial Terms.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Types of Plans.\nAs described on the FingerprintJS pricing page (located at https://fingerprintjs.com/pricing/) (the \u201c<strong>Pricing Page</strong>\u201d), two tiers of the Service are made available by FingerprintJS: (a) a free tier (\u201c<strong>Free Plan</strong>\u201d) and (b) a paid tier (\u201c<strong>Paid Plan</strong>\u201d).\nExcept as otherwise expressly noted, both the Free Plan and Paid Plan are subject to the terms of this Agreement.</li>\n<li>Fees and Taxes.\nFees are as described on the Pricing Page.\nAll fees and expenses are non-refundable except as set out in Section 10.i (FingerprintJS Indemnity).\nCustomer is responsible for any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding or similar taxes or levies that apply to any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, whether domestic or foreign (\u201c<strong>Taxes</strong>\u201d), other than FingerprintJS\u2019s income tax.\nFees and expenses are exclusive of Taxes.\n</li>\n<li>Payment.\nBilling.\nCustomer must provide FingerprintJS with a current, valid accepted method of payment (as it may be updated from time to time, \u201c<strong>Payment Method</strong>\u201d) in order to purchase and use a Paid Plan.\nFingerprintJS uses a third party payment processor (currently Stripe, Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>Stripe</strong>\u201d)) to process payments using the provided Payment Method.\nBy starting a Paid Plan and providing or designating a Payment Method, Customer agrees to be bound by Stripe\u2019s Services Agreement available at https://stripe.com/us/legal and further authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer any applicable fees at the then current rate, and any other charges Customer may incur in connection with Customer\u2019s use of the Service, to Customer\u2019s Payment Method.\nCustomer acknowledges that the amount billed each period may vary for reasons that may include the particular number of Unique Browser Instances during such period, different plan options or services, promotional offers, and/or changing a plan, and Customer authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer\u2019s Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges.\nFees for the Service may be billed at the beginning of the applicable billing cycle or at a later period, depending on the specific details of the Customer\u2019s Paid Plan (as described on the Pricing Page).\nAfter Customer\u2019s initial billing cycle, and again after any subsequent billing cycle, Customer\u2019s subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a \u201c<strong>Renewal Commencement Date</strong>\u201d) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at FingerprintJS\u2019s then-current price for such subscription.\nCustomer agrees that its Payment Method will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless Customer cancels its subscription at least thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Commencement Date.\nBy subscribing, Customer authorizes FingerprintJS to charge Customer\u2019s Payment Method for the initial billing cycle and any subsequent billing cycle.\nCustomer reserves the right to change the timing of its billing as indicated in this Section 5.iii.\nFingerprintJS may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of subscription or other charges.</li>\n<li>Fee Changes.\nFingerprintJS, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the fees for the Service.\nAny fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle.\nFingerprintJS will provide Customer with reasonable prior notice of any change in fees.\nCustomer\u2019s continued use of Service after a fee change comes into effect constitutes Customer\u2019s agreement to pay the modified fee amount.</li>\n<li>Suspension of Service.\nFingerprintJS may suspend Customer\u2019s access to the Service if (a) Customer breaches Section 1.ii (Restrictions) or Section 4 (Customer Obligations), (b) if Customer\u2019s account is 30 days or more overdue or (c) if Customer\u2019s actions risk harm to other customers or the security, availability or integrity of the Service.\nWhere practicable, FingerprintJS will use reasonable efforts to provide Customer with prior notice of the suspension.\nOnce Customer resolves the issue requiring suspension, FingerprintJS will promptly restore Customer\u2019s access to the Service in accordance with this Agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Warranty Disclaimer.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Disclaimers.\nTHE SERVICE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d.\nFINGERPRINTJS AND ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NONINFRINGEMENT.\nFINGERPRINTJS DOES NOT WARRANT VISITOR DATA WILL BE ACCURATE OR PRESERVED WITHOUT LOSS.\nFINGERPRINTJS IS NOT LIABLE FOR DELAYS, FAILURES OR PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE FINGERPRINTJS\u2019S CONTROL.\nFEATURES OF THE SERVICE DESIGNED TO DETECT AND FILTER CATEGORIES OF DATA HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS.\nFINGERPRINTJS DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICE WILL DETECT OR FILTER ALL DATA WITH COMPLETE ACCURACY.\nCUSTOMER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS OWN DATA HANDLING POLICIES.\nCUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT ANY STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST LEGALLY PERMITTED PERIOD.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Term and Termination.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Term.\nThis Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues until terminated in accordance with this Agreement (the \u201c<strong>Subscription Term</strong>\u201d).\n</li>\n<li>Termination.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement if the other party (a) fails to cure a material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within 30 days after written notice, (b) ceases operation without a successor or (c) seeks protection under a bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if such a proceeding is instituted against that party and not dismissed within 60 days.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, FingerprintJS may, in its sole and absolute discretion (x) terminate any Free Plan at any time and for any reason without notice and (y) terminate any Paid Plan for any reason with thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice.</li>\n<li>Effect of Termination.\nUpon expiration or termination of this Agreement, (a) Customer\u2019s right to use the Service (including its license to any Agent) will terminate, and (b) Customer shall immediately cease any and all use of and access to the Service.\nAt the disclosing party\u2019s request upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the receiving party will delete all of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information (as defined in Section 11) in its possession or control.\nCustomer acknowledges that following termination it shall have no further access to any Visitor Data input into the Service, and that FingerprintJS may delete any such data as may have been stored by FingerprintJS at any time.\nVisitor Data and other Confidential Information may be retained in the receiving party\u2019s standard backups after deletion but will remain subject to this Agreement\u2019s confidentiality restrictions.</li>\n<li>Survival.\nThese Sections survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1.ii (Restrictions), 3.i (Visitor Data) (but solely as it relates to derived data), 3.ii (Usage Data), 4 (Customer Obligations), 5.ii (Fees and Taxes), 6.i (Disclaimers), 7.iii (Effect of Termination), 7.iv (Survival), 8 (Ownership), 9 (Limitations of

other remedies a party may have.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ownership</strong>.\nNeither party grants the other any rights or licenses not expressly set out in this Agreement.\nExcept for FingerprintJS\u2019s use rights in this Agreement, between the parties Customer retains all intellectual property and other rights in Visitor Data provided to FingerprintJS.\nExcept for Customer\u2019s limited license and use rights set forth in Section 1 of this Agreement, FingerprintJS and its licensors retain all intellectual property and other rights in the Service and any related FingerprintJS technology, including any modifications or improvements to these items made by FingerprintJS.\nIf Customer provides FingerprintJS with feedback or suggestions regarding the Service or other FingerprintJS offerings, FingerprintJS may use the feedback or suggestions without restriction.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limitations of Liability.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Consequential Damages Waiver.\nNEITHER FINGERPRINTJS NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY IN ADVANCE.\n</li>\n<li>Liability Cap.\nFINGERPRINTJS\u2019S (AND ITS SUPPLIERS\u2019) ENTIRE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO FINGERPRINTJS DURING THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE CLAIM (OR, IF FEWER THAN 12 MONTHS HAVE ELAPSED UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THE AVERAGE MONTHLY FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO FINGERPRINTJS UNDER THE AGREEMENT MULTIPLIED BY 12).</li>\n<li>Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose.\nThe waivers and limitations in this Section 9 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy in this Agreement fails of its essential purpose.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Indemnification</strong>.\n<ol>\n<li>FingerprintJS Indemnity.\nFingerprintJS will defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the extent alleging that the Service, when used as authorized by Customer, infringes a third-party\u2019s U.S.\npatent, copyright or trademark, and will indemnify Customer against any damages or costs awarded against Customer (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) or agreed in settlement by FingerprintJS resulting from the claim.\nIn response to an actual or potential infringement claim, if required by settlement or injunction or as FingerprintJS determines necessary to avoid material liability, FingerprintJS may at its option: (a) procure rights for Customer\u2019s continued use of the Service, (b) replace or modify the alleged infringing portion of the Service to avoid infringement without reducing the Service\u2019s overall functionality or (c) terminate Customer\u2019s access to the infringing portion of the Service and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.\nFingerprintJS\u2019s obligations in this Section 10 do not apply (i) to infringement resulting from Customer\u2019s modification of the Agent or use of the Service in combination with items not provided by FingerprintJS, (ii) to infringement resulting from use of a non-supported version of the Agent, (iii) to unauthorized use of the Service, or (iv) if Customer settles or makes any admissions about a claim without FingerprintJS\u2019s prior written consent.\nThis Section 10 sets out Customer\u2019s exclusive remedy and FingerprintJS\u2019s entire liability regarding infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.</li>\n<li>Customer Indemnity.\nAt FingerprintJS\u2019s request, Customer will defend FingerprintJS and its affiliates from and against any third-party claim based upon or arising from Visitor Data or FingerprintJS\u2019s collection, storage, or processing thereof in compliance with this Agreement, and, regardless of whether FingerprintJS requests Customer to defend against such a claim, will indemnify FingerprintJS and its affiliates against any damages or costs awarded against FingerprintJS or its affiliates (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) or agreed in settlement by Customer resulting from the claim.</li>\n<li>Indemnity Procedures.\nThe party seeking defense and indemnification hereunder (the \u201c<strong>Indemnified Party</strong>\u201d) must provide the party from whom indemnification is sought (the \u201c<strong>Indemnifying Party</strong>\u201d): (a) prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that a failure to provide such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 10 except to the extent material prejudice results from such failure).\n(b) all reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying Party\u2019s request and expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.\nand (c) sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that (i) where Customer is the Indemnifying Party, such control only accrues to the extent FingerprintJS requests Customer\u2019s defense of the claim and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not agree to any settlement that places any obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party\u2019s written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Confidentiality.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Definition.\n\u201c<strong>Confidential Information</strong>\u201d means information disclosed under this Agreement

Service.\n</li>\n<li>Obligations.\nAs receiving party, each party will (a) hold in confidence and not disclose Confidential Information to third parties except as permitted in this Agreement, and (b) only use Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights in this Agreement.\nThe receiving party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for FingerprintJS, the subcontractors referenced in Section 13.ix), provided it remains responsible for their compliance with this Section 11 and they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 11.</li>\n<li>Exclusions.\nThese confidentiality obligations do not apply to information that the receiving party can document (a) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party, (b) it rightfully knew or possessed prior to receipt under this Agreement, (c) it rightfully received from a third party without breach of confidentiality obligations or (d) it independently developed without using the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information.\nThe receiving party may disclose Confidential Information if required by Applicable Laws, subpoena or court order, provided (if permitted by Applicable Laws) it notifies the disclosing party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment.\n</li>\n<li>Remedies.\nUnauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone are an insufficient remedy.\nEach party may seek appropriate equitable relief, in addition to other available remedies, for breach or threatened breach of this Section 11.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Publicity</strong>.\nNeither party may publicly announce this Agreement except with the other party\u2019s prior written consent or as required by Applicable

courts.</li>\n<li>Notices.\nExcept as set out in this Agreement, notices under this Agreement must be in writing to the addresses on the first page.\nEither party may update its address with notice to the other party.\nFingerprintJS may also send operational notices to Customer by email or through the Service.</li>\n<li>Entire Agreement.\nThis Agreement is the parties\u2019 entire agreement regarding its subject matter and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements regarding its subject matter.\nIn this Agreement, headings are for convenience only and \u201cincluding\u201d and similar terms are to be construed without limitation.\nThe terms in any Customer purchase order or business form will not amend or modify this Agreement and are expressly rejected by FingerprintJS.\nany of these Customer documents are for administrative purposes only and have no legal effect.</li>\n<li>Amendments.\nFingerprintJS may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, modify this Agreement by posting a revised version of this Agreement on its website.\nIf FingerprintJS modifies the Agreement, FingerprintJS will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the changes.\nIf Customer does not agree to the revised Agreement, then Customer may not use or continue to use the Service.\nChanges will become effective no sooner than seven (7) days after they are posted.\nprovided that changes addressing new functions or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately.</li>\n<li>Waivers and Severability.\nWaivers must be signed by the waiving party\u2019s authorized representative and cannot be implied from conduct.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, it will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so the rest of this Agreement remains in effect.\n</li>\n<li>Audit Rights.\nUpon FingerprintJS\u2019s written request, Customer shall certify in a signed writing that Customer\u2019s use of the Service is in full compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</li>\n<li>Force Majeure.\nNeither party is liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) due to events beyond its reasonable control, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, internet or utility failures, refusal of government license or natural disaster.</li>\n<li>Subcontractors.\nFingerprintJS may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise FingerprintJS\u2019s rights, but FingerprintJS remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement.</li>\n<li>Independent Contractors.\nThe parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners or joint venturers.</li>\n<li>Open Source.\nCertain aspects of the Service may contain or be provided with third-party components subject to the terms and conditions of \u201copen source\u201d software licenses (\u201c<strong>Third-Party</strong>\n<strong>Open Source</strong>\u201d).\nThird-Party Open Source may be identified in the Service (or a portion thereof), the Documentation, or FingerprintJS shall provide a list of the Third-Party Open Source to Customer upon Customer\u2019s written request.\nTo the extent required by the license that accompanies the Third-Party Open Source, the terms of such
