January 1, 2020.</em>\n</p>\n<p>For details on our refund deadlines and policies, please refer to the information below.\nPlease note that our policies differ between subscription payments and one-time payments made for course, Specialization, and guided project purchases, and that payment options may vary from one Service to another.\nPlease also note that we treat violations of our Terms of Use and Honor Code very seriously, and we have no obligation to offer refunds to users who violate these terms, even if their requests are made within the designated refund period.\nSimilarly, we have no obligation to offer late refunds to users who do not receive a passing mark in the Content Offering, or who are otherwise unsatisfied with their final grade.</p>\n<p>For more information about our refund process, including instructions for requesting a refund, please visit our Learner Help Center.</p>For Month-to-Month Subscriptions<p>Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made on a month-month subscription plan.\nTo avoid being charged during a free trial promotion, you must cancel your subscription before your 7-day free trial ends.\nIf you complete a course during the free trial period, Coursera reserves the right to require you to pay for a one-month subscription in order to receive a Course and/or Specialization Certificate.</p>\n<p>Your subscription will continue on a month-to-month basis unless and until you cancel or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera.\nFor subscriptions to individual Specializations, Coursera will automatically discontinue your subscription at the end of the monthly period during which you earn a Specialization Certificate for the Specialization, unless you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Coursera's ability to do so -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store.\nPlease visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies.\nYou must cancel your subscription before your monthly renewal date to avoid the next billing.</p>\n<p>If you cancel your subscription, cancellation will be effective at the end of the current monthly period.\nyou will have continued access to your subscription for the remainder of that period, but you will not receive a refund.</p>For Coursera Plus<p>To get a full refund of your Coursera Plus subscription payment, submit a refund request via the Learner Help Center within 14 days of your payment.\nRefunds will not be provided if requested after this 14-day period.\nSome Coursera Plus subscriptions may have a free trial period instead of a refund period.\nIf you do not cancel during the free trial, you will be billed the full amount for the subscription you signed up for and be unable to request a refund.</p>\n<p>Your Coursera Plus subscription will continue for the subscription period identified at the time of your purchase and then automatically renew unless and until you cancel your subscription or the subscription is suspended or discontinued by Coursera.</p>\n<p>If you cancel your subscription after the first 14 days of your subscription period, you will continue to have access until the end of the subscription period and will not be billed for the next billing cycle.</p>For One-time Course and Specialization Purchases<p>If you cancel your paid enrollment for a standalone course, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier.\nIf you pre-enroll and pay for a course, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the course launches or until you have earned your Course Certificate, whichever is earlier.\nFor avoidance doubt, once you have earned a Course Certificate with your payment, you are not eligible for a refund even if it is within 14 days.\nIf you do not earn your Course Certificate within 180 days, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the course.\nHowever, if you\u2019re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g.\nCoursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs ) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract.\nSimilarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera.</p>\n<p>If you cancel your one-time, paid enrollment for a Specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after payment, or until you earn a Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier.\nIf you pre-enroll and pay for the Specialization, Coursera will offer you a complete refund until 14 days after the first course in the Specialization launches or until you have earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization, whichever is earlier.\nIf you earned your first Course Certificate for any course in the Specialization within 14 days, you are not eligible for a refund.\nUnless otherwise indicated as part of the sign-up process, you have one year after you purchase a Specialization to complete the Specialization.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, shorter refund periods may apply to specific courses and Specializations (e.g., for courses that are part of the UCI Professional Certificate in Applied Project Management, you will only be eligible for a full refund until seven days after your payment date).\nIn these cases, the shorter period will be stated as part of the sign-up process for the course or Specialization.</p>For Guided Projects<p>Coursera does not offer refunds for payments made for guided projects.\nIf you do not earn your completion certificate within 180 days after registering for a guided project, your registration will expire and you will need to pay to re-enroll for the guided project in order to complete the guided project and earn your completion certificate.\nHowever, if you\u2019re taking a course through your company or organization (e.g.\nCoursera for Business, Coursera for Governments or Organizations, Coursera for Refugees, or other Coursera Social Good programs) then you can earn your certificate as long as your company's contract with Coursera is active and your access has not expired in accordance with the terms of that contract.\nSimilarly, refunds and cancellations will also be governed by the terms of that contract between your organization and Coursera.\nIf you have subscribed through a third party marketplace that restricts Coursera's ability to issue refunds -- e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store, please visit the third party marketplace for information regarding their policies.\n</p>For Degree and MasterTrack Certificate Programs<p>Refund policies for degree and MasterTrack certificate programs are established and administered by the university partner offering the program.\nRefund policies are communicated to students by Coursera\u2019s university partners.</p>For Other Paid Services<p>Except as described in this Refund Policy or as explicitly stated as part of the sign-up process for a Service, Coursera has no obligation to provide refunds or vouchers for any other Services.</p>Third Party Marketplaces<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchase or subscribe for a course, Specialization, guided project, or purchase any other paid Service, through a third party marketplace (e.g., in-app purchases through the Apple App Store or purchases made through certain alternative payment services), the refund policy applicable to that third party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera.\nExcept as otherwise explicitly stated by Coursera, the third party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Coursera will have no refund obligations.\nCoursera disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.</p>Honor Code <p>\n<em>Effective as of January 1, 2020</em>\n</p>\n<p>All students participating in the class must agree to abide by the following code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I will register for only one account, unless expressly permitted to register for additional accounts by Coursera.</li>\n<li>My answers

by law or regulation to have access to the personal data.</li>\n<li>It has no reason to believe, at the time of entering into these clauses, in the existence of any local laws that would have a substantial adverse effect on the guarantees provided for under these clauses, and it will inform the data exporter (which will pass such notification on to the authority where required) if it becomes aware of any such laws.</li>\n<li>It will process the personal data for purposes described in Annex B, and has the legal authority to give the warranties and fulfil the undertakings set out in these clauses.</li>\n<li>It will identify to the data exporter a contact point within its organisation authorised to respond to enquiries concerning processing of the personal data, and will cooperate in good faith with the data exporter, the data subject and the authority concerning all such enquiries within a reasonable time.\nIn case of legal dissolution of the data exporter, or if the parties have so agreed, the data importer will assume responsibility for compliance with the provisions of clause I(e).</li>\n<li>At the request of the data exporter, it will provide the data exporter with evidence of financial resources sufficient to fulfil its responsibilities under clause III (which may include insurance coverage).</li>\n<li>Upon reasonable request of the data exporter, it will submit its data processing facilities, data files and documentation needed for processing to reviewing, auditing and/or certifying by the data exporter (or any independent or impartial inspection agents or auditors, selected by the data exporter and not reasonably objected to by the data importer) to ascertain compliance with the warranties and undertakings in these clauses, with reasonable notice and during regular business hours.\nThe request will be subject to any necessary consent or approval from a regulatory or supervisory authority within the country of the data importer, which consent or approval the data importer will attempt to obtain in a timely fashion.</li>\n<li>It will process the personal data, at its option, in accordance with:\nthe data protection laws of the country in which the data exporter is established, or\nthe relevant provisions of any Commission decision pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC, where the data importer complies with the relevant provisions of such an authorisation or decision and is based in a country to which such an authorisation or decision pertains, but is not covered by such authorisation or decision for the purposes of the transfer(s) of the personal data, or\nthe data processing principles set forth in Annex A.\nData importer to indicate which option it selects: The data protections laws of the region where the exporter is based, namely, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>\n<li>It will not disclose or transfer the personal data to a third party data controller located outside the European Economic Area (EEA) unless it notifies the data exporter about the transfer and\nthe third party data controller processes the personal data in accordance with a Commission decision finding that a third country provides adequate protection, or\nthe third party data controller becomes a signatory to these clauses or another data transfer agreement approved by a competent authority in the EU, or\ndata subjects have been given the opportunity to object, after having been informed of the purposes of the transfer, the categories of recipients and the fact that the countries to which data is exported may have different data protection standards, or\nwith regard to onward transfers of sensitive data, data subjects have given their unambiguous consent to the onward transfer.</li>\n</ul>Clause IIILiability and third party rights<ul>\n<li>Each party shall be liable to the other parties for damages it causes by any breach of these clauses.\nLiability as between the parties is limited to actual damage suffered.\nPunitive damages (i.e.\ndamages intended to punish a party for its outrageous conduct) are specifically excluded.\nEach party shall be liable to data subjects for damages it causes by any breach of third party rights under these clauses.\nThis does not affect the liability of the data exporter under its data protection law.</li>\n<li>The parties agree that a data subject shall have the right to enforce as a third party beneficiary this clause and clauses I(b), I(d), I(e), II(a), II(c), II(d), II(e), II(h), II(i), III(a), V, VI(d) and VII against the data importer or the data exporter, for their respective breach of their contractual obligations, with regard to his personal data, and accept jurisdiction for this purpose in the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment.\nIn cases involving allegations of breach by the data importer, the data subject must first request the data exporter to take appropriate action to enforce his rights against the data importer.\nif the data exporter does not take such action within a reasonable period (which under normal circumstances would be one month), the data subject may then enforce his rights against the data importer directly.\nA data subject is entitled to proceed directly against a data exporter that has failed to use reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able to satisfy its legal obligations under these clauses (the data exporter shall have the burden to prove that it took reasonable efforts).</li>\n</ul>Clause IVLaw applicable to the clauses<p>These clauses shall be governed by the law of the country in which the data exporter is established, with the exception of the laws and regulations relating to processing of the personal data by the data importer under clause II(h), which shall apply only if so selected by the data importer under that clause.</p>Clause VResolution of disputes with data subjects or the authority<ul>\n<li>In the event of a dispute or claim brought by a data subject or the authority concerning the processing of the personal data against either or both of the parties, the parties will inform each other about any such disputes or claims, and will cooperate with a view to settling them amicably in a timely fashion.</li>\n<li>The parties agree to respond to any generally available non-binding mediation procedure initiated by a data subject or by the authority.\nIf they do participate in the proceedings, the parties may elect to do so remotely (such as by telephone or other electronic means).\nThe parties also agree to consider participating in any other arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution proceedings developed for data protection disputes.</li>\n<li>Each party shall abide by a decision of a competent court of the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment or of the authority which is final and against which no further appeal is possible.</li>\n</ul>Clause VITermination<ul>\n<li>In the event that the data importer is in breach of its obligations under these clauses, then the data exporter may temporarily suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until the breach is repaired or the contract is terminated.</li>\n<li>In the event that:\nthe transfer of personal data to the data importer has been temporarily suspended by the data exporter for longer than one month pursuant to paragraph (a).\ncompliance by the data importer with these clauses would put it in breach of its legal or regulatory obligations in the country of import.\nthe data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of any warranties or undertakings given by it under these clauses.\na final decision against which no further appeal is possible of a competent court of the data exporter\u2019s country of establishment or of the authority rules that there has been a breach of the clauses by the data importer or the data exporter.\nor\na petition is presented for the administration or winding up of the data importer, whether in its personal or business capacity, which petition is not dismissed within the applicable period for such dismissal under applicable law.\na winding up order is made.\na receiver is appointed over any of its assets.\na trustee in bankruptcy is appointed, if the data importer is an individual.\na company voluntary arrangement is commenced by it.\nor any equivalent event in any jurisdiction occurs\nthen the data exporter, without prejudice to any other rights which it may have against the data importer, shall be entitled to terminate these clauses, in which case the authority shall be informed where required.\nIn cases covered by (i), (ii), or (iv) above the data importer may also terminate these clauses.</li>\n<li>Either party may terminate these clauses if (i) any Commission positive adequacy decision under Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) is issued in relation to the country (or a sector thereof) to which the data is transferred and processed by the data importer, or (ii) Directive 95/46/EC (or any superseding text) becomes directly applicable in such country.</li>\n<li>The parties agree that the termination of these clauses at any time, in any circumstances and for whatever reason (except for termination under clause VI(c)) does not exempt them from the obligations and/or conditions under the clauses as regards the processing of the personal data transferred.</li>\n</ul>Clause VIIVariation of these clauses<p>The parties may not modify these clauses except to update any information in Annex B, in which case they will inform the authority where required.\nThis does not preclude the parties from adding additional commercial clauses where required.</p>Clause VIIIDescription of the Transfer<p>The details of the transfer and of the personal data are specified in Annex B.\nThe parties agree that Annex B may contain confidential business information which they will not disclose to third parties, except as required by law or in response to a competent regulatory or government agency, or as required under clause I(e).\nThe parties may execute additional annexes to cover additional transfers, which will be submitted to the authority where required.\nAnnex B may, in the alternative, be drafted to cover multiple transfers.</p>ANNEX A<p>\n<em>DATA PROCESSING PRINCIPLES</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purpose limitation: Personal data may be processed and subsequently used or further communicated only for purposes described in Annex B or subsequently authorised by the data subject.</li>\n<li>Data quality and proportionality: Personal data must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.\nThe personal data must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are transferred and further processed.</li>\n<li>Transparency: Data subjects must be provided with information necessary to ensure fair processing (such as information about the purposes of processing and about the transfer), unless such information has already been given by the data exporter.</li>\n<li>Security and confidentiality: Technical and organisational security measures must be taken by the data controller that are appropriate to the risks, such as against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, presented by the processing.\nAny person acting under the authority of the data controller, including a processor, must not process the data except on instructions from the data controller.</li>\n<li>Rights of access, rectification, deletion and objection: As provided in Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC, data subjects must, whether directly or via a third party, be provided with the personal information about them that an organisation holds, except for requests which are manifestly abusive, based on unreasonable intervals or their number or repetitive or systematic nature, or for which access need not be granted under the law of the country of the data exporter.\nProvided that the authority has given its prior approval, access need also not be granted when doing so would be likely to seriously harm the interests of the data importer or other organisations dealing with the data importer and such interests are not overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\nThe sources of the personal data need not be identified when this is not possible by reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.\nData subjects must be able to have the personal information about them rectified, amended, or deleted where it is inaccurate or processed against these principles.\nIf there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of the request, the organisation may require further justifications before proceeding to rectification, amendment or deletion.\nNotification of any rectification, amendment or deletion to third parties to whom the data have been disclosed need not be made when this involves a disproportionate effort.\nA data subject must also be able to object to the processing of the personal data relating to him if there are compelling legitimate grounds relating to his particular situation.\nThe burden of proof for any refusal rests on the data importer, and the data subject may always challenge a refusal before the authority.</li>\n<li>Sensitive data: The data importer shall take such additional measures (e.g.\nrelating to security) as are necessary to protect such sensitive data in accordance with its obligations under clause II.</li>\n<li>Data used for marketing purposes: Where data are processed for the purposes of direct marketing, effective procedures should exist allowing the data subject at any time to \u201copt-out\u201d from having his data used for such purposes.</li>\n<li>Automated decisions: For purposes hereof \u201cautomated decision\u201d shall mean a decision by the data exporter or the data importer which produces legal effects concerning a data subject or significantly affects a data subject and which is based solely on automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to him, such as his performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, conduct, etc.\nThe data importer shall not make any automated decisions concerning data subjects, except when: a) i.\nsuch decisions are made by the data importer in entering into or performing a contract with the data subject, and ii.\nthe data subject is given an opportunity to discuss the results of a relevant automated decision with a representative of the parties making such decision or otherwise to make representations to that parties.\nor b)\twhere otherwise provided by the law of the data exporter.</li>\n</ul>ANNEX

Kingdom.</p>\n<p>When we use the term \"Sensitive Personal Information\" in this Privacy Shield Notice, we are referring to a particular subset of an individual\u2019s Personal Information that provides details of his or her race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership or that concerns his or her health.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this Privacy Shield Notice is to outline our general practices for implementing the Principles with respect to the Personal Information we collect.\nIf you would like to

Notice.</p>Principles.<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice</strong>.\nWe will provide you with timely and appropriate notice in our Terms of Use and Privacy Notice, describing what Personal Information we are collecting, how we will use that information, and the types of third parties with whom we may share such information (and the reasons we do so).\nPlease review these documents carefully.\nWhere we process personal data on behalf of our business partners, we will work with them to help them provide appropriate notice to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Choice</strong>.\nWe will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of your Personal Information (or to provide explicit consent for Sensitive Personal Information) being: (i) disclosed to a third party (other than a service provider as set forth below).\nor (ii) used for a purpose materially different from the purpose for which it was originally collected (as set out in our Privacy Notice), or subsequently authorized by you, when the

options.\nIf you have further questions related to the above, you can also contact us at privacyshield@coursera.org.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where we process personal data on behalf of our business partners,

appropriate).</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that we may disclose Personal Information under the following circumstances without offering you an opportunity to opt out of such disclosure: (i) to our Content Providers and other service providers that we have retained to perform requested Services on our behalf.\n(ii) if we are required to do so by law or legal process.\n(iii) pursuant to valid requests by law enforcement or other government authorities (which we are legally required to respond to).\nand (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.\nIn addition, we reserve the right to transfer Personal Information in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).\nShould such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use the Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Shield Notice.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Onward Transfers (Transfer to Third

Privacy Shield Notice and the Principles.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may be potentially liable if these requirements are not met.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Security</strong>.\nWe will
