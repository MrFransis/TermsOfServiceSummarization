information available through this website current and accurate, but makes no guarantees and disclaims any implied warranty or representation about the website\u2019s accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, or appropriateness for a particular purpose.\nInformation on this website may be updated at any time and without notice.</p>\n<p>When you access&nbsp;usfamilyhealth.org, conduct any transaction, use any functionality or tool, or access information on or through&nbsp;the website, you are agreeing to accept the legal disclaimers and adhere to the privacy and security policies set forth on the website.</p>\n<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>\n<p>In no event shall US Family Health Plan be liable for any direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, or any damages whatsoever resulting from any loss of use, loss of profits, litigation, or any other pecuniary loss, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), product liability, or otherwise, arising out of or in any way connected with this website or the provision of or failure to make available any such products, goods, or services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>\n<strong>Privacy and Security on the Public Site</strong>\n<p>US Family Health Plan understands that privacy of information is of great importance to our members and the people who visit our website.\nWe want you to know that US Family Health Plan does not sell information obtained through use of this website to anyone.\nIn addition, we have established the following privacy and security practices with respect to the public portions of usfamilyhealth.org.</p>\n<p>Because we want&nbsp.\nthe website&nbsp;to better serve visitors\u2019 needs, we collect some basic information about visitors\u2019 computers, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP address (the computer\u2019s unique signature)</li>\n<li>Operating system (e.g., Windows Vista)</li>\n<li>Browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox)</li>\n<li>Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL)</li>\n<li>Geographic location (e.g., Boston, Mass.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The information we collect about visitors\u2019 computers will not be used to identify individuals.\nInstead, we check which Web pages and services people use while they are here.\nFor example, we use the browser information to help us design our website so that as many people as possible will be able to view the pages correctly.\nThe information helps us determine what parts of the site people like and what parts they don\u2019t, so that we can adjust information appropriately.</p>\n<strong>Privacy and Security on the Secured Sites</strong>\n<p>The secure member portal that is password protected and requires individuals to register and log-in contains protected health information (PHI) and allows individuals to perform certain transactions (e.g., order an ID card).\nBecause of this, a user\u2019s activity needs to be linked back to the user\u2019s identity.\nFor example, when a member changes his or her PCP, we must be able to make that change within our systems and we cannot do that without linking the information back to the member.\nIn addition, it is important for us to keep track of what functionality a member uses.\nTherefore, in the secure member portal, certain identifiable information is collected about users.\nThis includes information about the user\u2019s computer as listed above, and information related to the user, such as pages visited and PHI submitted or changed.</p>\n<p>The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your PHI are important to US Family Health Plan.\nTo protect against unauthorized access to PHI that is accessible on the password-protected portions of our site, stringent security standards are followed.\nData transmitted between your browser and the secure member portal is protected by 128-bit encryption.<br>PHI that is collected from users on the secure member portal is confidential.\nAll PHI US Family Health Plan has regarding our members is available only to authorized users and is protected from unauthorized access by multiple layers of security controls and monitoring.\nIn addition, PHI that is collected and maintained by US Family Health Plan is used and disclosed only in accordance with our Notice of Privacy Practices in the Member Handbook.</p>\n<p>E-mail addresses are collected as part of the registration process for the secure member portal.\nThese e-mail addresses are used to notify registrants of online activity related to the security and privacy of their accounts, such as retrievals of username.\nIn addition, e-mail addresses may be used to send members health and wellness information and other updates that might be of interest to them as members of US Family Health Plan.\nEach time we send health and wellness information and other updates, the recipient will be given the opportunity to opt out of receiving similar e-mails in the future.\nPlease note that registrants cannot opt out of receiving e-mails that notify them of online activity, since these are necessary to protect the privacy and security of Web accounts.</p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n<p>We use \u201ccookies\u201d on the public site and the secure member portal to help users better navigate the sites.\nThey are used only for that distinct purpose.\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is a small piece of information sent by our Web server to store on your Web browser.\nWe use this information to tell if you have been given important messages about the functioning of this site.</p>\n<strong>E-mail</strong>\n<p>We welcome your comments or questions about our website and have provided an e-mail option for that purpose.\nWe will share your comments and questions with our member services representatives and those employees most capable of addressing your questions and concerns.\nRemember, your e-mail may not be encrypted and may be accessed and viewed by other Internet users without your knowledge while in transit to us.\nFor that reason, please do not send confidential health care or personal information to us by e-mail.\nUS Family Health Plan disclaims any responsibility for any breach of confidentiality resulting from your transmittal of such e-mail.\nIf you need to contact US Family Health Plan regarding confidential matters, please call Member Services at 1.800.818.8589.</p>\n<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>\n<p>For your interest
