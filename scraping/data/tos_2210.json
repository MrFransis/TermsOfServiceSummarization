the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.\nIt does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Website or other websites.\nYou may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.\nAlso, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.\nAdditional information is available on NAI's
