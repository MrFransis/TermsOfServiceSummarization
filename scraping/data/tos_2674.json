amount of bandwidth and disrupting the service for other users, then we reserve the right to contact that user and ask them to explain their conduct.</p>\n<br> Software Analytics, Stats<p> 'PureVPN collects minimal connection statistics and reports.\nThe collection is done to ensure superior quality of service and customer support.\nHowever, the data collected as statistics and reports does not

prosecution, upon failing to meet these obligations.</p>\n<p>Please understand that we have taken even precautionary measure to ensure that your data remains protected, but there exists no system that can be declared 100% foolproof, protected and secure.</p>\n<br>Data Retention Policy &amp.\nYour Data Protection Rights<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the following data protection

of fake accounts in your name.\nYour email address will be deleted only after we receive an explicit request from you to do so.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Applicable Laws<p>PureVPN specifically chose Hong Kong (HK) for its headquarter because there are \"No Mandatory Data Retention Laws\" in Hong Kong.\nWe are, therefore, not legally obliged to store user data and share it with anyone.\nMoreover, as stated above, we have no worthwhile data to share with any law enforcement agency from any particular country in the world.\nEven if and when we receive subpoenas that are legally upheld in the court of law in Hong Kong, we won\u2019t be of much help since we have almost nothing of value to share.</p>\n<br>Cookies and PureVPN<p>PureVPN utilizes various types of cookies \u2013 small text files \u2013 to
