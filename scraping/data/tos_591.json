week.</p>\n</li>\n<li> trees icon_new Created with Sketch.\nWe don\u2019t sell your data to advertisers <p>Many web services collect user data in order to sell it without asking your permission.\nWe don\u2019t sell your data or your searches to advertising companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li> sea icon_new Created with Sketch.\nYour searches are encrypted <p>We protect your searches from potential eavesdroppers with a securely encrypted connection.\nThis way we make sure that nobody between you and us can see your searches.</p>\n</li>\n<li> fish icon_new Created with Sketch.\nWe don\u2019t use external tracking tools <p>Most websites use external tracking tools, like Google Analytics, to optimize their services.\nWe don\u2019t use such third party trackers, in order to prevent others from accessing your searches.</p>\n</li>\n<li> You can turn off all our tracking <p>We only collect a small amount of data to be able to improve our services.\nIf you want to opt out of tracking, you can activate \u201cDo Not Track\u201d in your browser\u2019s settings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Have more questions? <p>See the answers to the most common questions people have about their privacy</p> How does Ecosia protect my privacy? <p>We only collect the data we absolutely need and do so with a self-hosted, secure and encrypted in-house analytics system.</p>\n<p>We do not, and never will, share or sell any data we collect ourselves with any third party.\nAlso, no third party that is not directly involved in answering your search request will ever have access to your search data.</p>\n<p>For all data we collect ourselves, we take data protection very seriously and take many steps to ensure it is safe and anonymous.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We remove parts of the IP address when we store it so they become anonymous.\nFor example 192.168.152.223 becomes 192.168.XXX.XXX</li>\n<li>We do not use unique event fingerprinting</li>\n<li>We send all data collected from Ecosia services over an SSL-secured connection</li>\n<li>We store all analytics data in an highly encrypted database</li>\n<li>We only keep fully anonymised search data after 7 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have \"Do Not Track\" enabled in your browser settings we do not collect any analytics data.\nMost other websites ignore this setting - we think users should have a choice.</p>\n<p>We only allow connections to our search engine over a secured SSL/HTTPS connection.\nThis way no one between you and Ecosia can secretly listen in on your searches.\nWe use Digicert, one of the largest and most trusted SSL certificate authorities, to generate and manage our SSL certificates.</p>\n<p>Ecosia\u2019s servers are located around the world in order to provide a fast response no matter where you are.\nHowever, when you perform a search on Ecosia, your request will generally be routed to the server that is geographically nearest to you.\nThat means, for example, if you are located in Germany your search traffic will remain within Germany and will fall under strict German privacy regulations.</p> Why are you collecting data at all? <p>At Ecosia, we want to make sure our users have the best search experience possible.\nWe collect data and do statistical analysis to understand user behavior and trends, how people use our services, and to monitor, troubleshoot, and improve Ecosia.\nWe might, for example, use it to decide which new feature to build next.</p>\n<p>For this we use a self-hosted, secure and encrypted in-house analytics system.\nThis allows us to gather data about how our users interact with Ecosia products in a secure and anonymized way.</p>\n<p>We also save the searches we receive to filter spam.\nUnfortunately there is a lot of spam search requests and this allows us to block them.\nIf we would not block spam it would cost us money and resources to answer these search requests, meaning that we would plant less trees.</p>\n<p>After 7 days we remove all personal information (like the IP address) from the search data.\nThis way we make 100% sure that we have no way of knowing who searched for what and also no way of connecting different searches to each other or creating any kind of profiles.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we collect anonymous data to help identify and fix bugs and issues in Ecosia products and services.\nThis data for example includes log data collected by our servers or data related to program crashes and exceptions.</p> What about cookies? <p>A cookie is a small text file that the website you visit sends to your computer.\nEcosia uses cookies to store your settings, so we know in which language to show you this page for example.</p>\n<p>Information stored in our cookies include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your country and language settings</li>\n<li>Whether or not you have installed an extension</li>\n<li>The value of your search counter</li>\n<li>Your adult filter settings</li>\n<li>The timestamp of your last search</li>\n<li>Your Bing Client ID (if enabled)</li>\n<li>If you have interacted with certain features before, to for example show you that you have unread notifications</li>\n<li>In some cases which way you have found out about Ecosia</li>\n<li>In some cases an identifier for our own anonymous usage data, for example to know how many users we have</li>\n<li>To determine which version of the page to show you if we are running a test with two different version (A/B test)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not store any personal information in the cookie.</p> Can anyone see my searches? <p>After 7 days we remove all personal information (like the IP address) from the search data we collect ourselves.\nSo we don't know what you have searched for.</p>\n<p>We will never share your searches with anyone except services that are directly involved in answering your search request, like Bing.\nTo make sure, we don't use any third party tools on the Ecosia Search pages.\nWe also actively prevent \"Search Leakage\", so none of the sites you visit by clicking on a search result on Ecosia know what you searched for.</p>\n<p>Ecosia does provide options for performing searches on various third party websites via the \u201cMore\u201d dropdown, the \u201cMaps\u201d tab, and the Ecosia Search Tag feature.\nPlease be aware that we can\u2019t influence what third party websites track about you once you have followed a link.</p> Will any data ever be shared with 3rd parties? <p>We will never share your searches with anyone except services that are directly involved in answering your search request, like Bing.\nTo make sure, we don't use any third party tools on the Ecosia Search pages.</p>\n<p>There are some cases where information you actively submit will be handled by third party tools.\nThey all store it securely and don't share it with anyone.\nThey also all follow the strict EU privacy laws.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When using our newsletter: Mailchimp</li>\n<li>When applying for a position with us: Lever</li>\n<li>When using the contact form or reading our FAQs: Zendesk</li>\n<li>Data about how well our servers are running: Sentry, HockeyApp, Papertrail</li>\n<li>When visiting our Blog: Ghost</li>\n<li>When sending yourself an sms to download our mobile app: Branch.io</li>\n<li>When taking part in a survey: Typeform</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ecosia does use third party tools on non-search pages where absolutely necessary to help us understand and tune our marketing campaigns.\nFor example, we may run an ad campaign on a social media site that requires us to share some data about user activity in order to help us understand how effective that campaign is.\nThis helps us to prevent spending money on unsuccessful advertising campaigns that could instead be used to plant trees.</p>\n<p>If you wish to revoke consent of these third party tools to collect your data please use the following links.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/</li>\n<li>Adwords: https://adssettings.google.com</li>\n</ul> What data do you share with search results providers like Bing? <p>We do work with third parties to answer your search requests.\nTo some of our partners we don\u2019t send your search query or any other information, like the IP address.\nFor example, for our weather results we only send the location we are requesting weather information for.\nTo other partners we have to forward more details in order to answer your search request.</p>\n<p>For example, when you do a search on Ecosia we forward the following information to our partner, Bing: IP address (obfuscated), user agent string, search term, and some settings like your country and language setting.</p>\n<p>Additionally, by default Ecosia sets a Bing-specific \u201cClient ID\u201d parameter to improve the quality of your search results.\nIf your browser has \u201cDo Not Track\u201d enabled, we disable the \u201cClient ID\u201d automatically.\nYou can also choose to disable this feature by modifying your user settings.</p>\n<p>Bing automatically anonymizes your Ecosia search history and unique identifier after 4 days.\nFor more information on how Bing handles your data see their privacy policy.</p> How can you protect my privacy, if you show ads? <p>Like other search engines, we do display search ads next to the search results.\nWhen users click on these ads we earn income, which we use for tree planting.\nWe can display these advertisements while still being privacy friendly.</p>\n<p>We work with ad networks, like Bing Ads, to show ads based on your search query.\nWhen you do a search and ads are displayed next to the search results no data is collected or shared with the advertiser.</p> How does your privacy policy compare to other search engines? <p>Ecosia is a \u201cprivacy friendly\u201d search engine.\nWe take user privacy very seriously.</p>\n<p>By using Ecosia (instead of for example Google) you drastically reduce the amount of data that is collected about you.\nAt Ecosia, we don\u2019t create personal profiles of you, but anonymize all searches after 7 days.\nGoogle has lots of other services (Android, Chrome, Gmail, YouTube, Google Analytics being used on other websites etc.), which means they can combine data from a lot of sources and create a detailed profile of you to show you personalized search results and advertisements.</p>\n<p>There are only a few search engines with their own web index - for example Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu.\nMost other general web search engines cooperate and share data with these companies in some form.\nWe currently work with Bing and are very transparent about what we share with them.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, no search engine can ever provide perfect protection of your search data, because other parties \u2013 like your network provider or browser for example \u2013 might still be able to access some of your data.\nIf you think somebody might be after you, we would recommend checking out security tools like VPNs and services like TOR.</p> Want to dive into the fine print? <p>See the in-depth legal version of our privacy policy, with detailed information on how we handle your data.</p>\n<p>The protection of your privacy is extremely important to us.\nThis data protection declaration provides information on how

with Ecosia, data are transferred to Bing.\nBing is operated by: Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd, Carmanhall Road, Sandyford Industrial Estate, Dublin 18, Ireland (referred to below as: Bing).\nThis is done in order to display search results and to prevent fraudulent activities.\nThe following data are transferred to Bing during a search enquiry: IP address, user agent string, search term, country and language settings, filter settings for adult content, active search filter settings (e.g.\nfilter search results by date).</p>\n<p>Ecosia also assigns a \u201cBing Client ID\u201d in order to improve the quality of the search results.\nThis value is a user-specific ID which enables Bing to deliver more relevant search results also based on previous searches.\nThe ID is saved in the Ecosia cookie and retrieved during future visits.\nIn both cases, the legal basis for the processing of these data is Art.\n6 Para.\n1 S.\n1 lit.\nf of the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>\n<p>However, you have full control over the use of this \u201cClient ID\u201d.\nIf \u201cDo not track\u201d is activated in your browser, the Client ID is automatically deactivated and neither saved nor sent.\nThe Client ID and personalised search results can also be switched off specifically in the Ecosia search settings.</p>\n<p>Microsoft/Bing is certified under the \u201cPrivacy

operate, in order to analyse and continuously improve the use of our website.\nUsing the statistics obtained, we can improve our offering and design it in a more interesting way for you as a user.\nThe legal basis for this processing of your personal data is Art.\n6 Abs.\n1 lit.\nf of the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>\n<p>For this evaluation, cookies (see above) are saved on your computer and the following data are processed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>The website visited</li>\n<li>The website from which you arrived at the website visited</li>\n<li>The sub-pages visited following on from the website visited</li>\n<li>Access status / HTTP status code</li>\n<li>The length of time spent visiting the website</li>\n<li>The frequency of visits to the website</li>\n<li>Your click behaviour on the website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These data are anonymised after a short space of time, generally 7 days.\nThe anonymised data are saved for as long as is necessary for the evaluation.\nThe data are not transferred to any third party.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to take part in the tracking, you can deactivate the gathering of all usage data by activating the \u201cDo not track\u201d setting in your browser.</p> h.\nA/B testing <p>We additionally carry out analyses of usage behaviour by means of \u201cA/B testing\u201d.\nAs part of this, based on the completion of a profile assignment, we can show you our websites with slightly varied content.\nThus, we can analyse and continuously improve our offering, and make it more interesting

computer for the purpose of allocation to a test group.\nAllocation to the test groups is always carried out on a random basis.\nWe use the data gathered by our web analysis service (see above) for the evaluation.\nWe save the information gathered in this way on our server in Germany only.</p>\n<p>Before carrying out the analyses, the IP addresses are processed further in a shortened form, thus preventing direct traceability to any particular individual.\nThe IP address forwarded by your browser is not amalgamated with other data we have gathered.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to take part in the tests, you can deactivate the gathering of all usage data and the saving of the relevant cookies by activating the \u201cDo not track\u201d setting in your browser.</p> i.\nOnline advertising Advertising on Ecosia <p>At Ecosia, advertisements are shown beside or above the search results.\nIf you click on these adverts, we earn commission.\nWe use this to pursue the interest in generating income which goes towards covering our ongoing costs and payments to tree planting projects.\nThese adverts are provided by advertising networks.</p>\n<p>We work with the Bing Ad Network.\nDuring the search and simple display of an advert, no data are transferred to this advertising network (only to Bing, see above).\nThe following data, among others, are only sent to the advertising network when you click on an ad: the search term, your IP address, place, date and time of the search inquiry and the browser configuration.</p>\n<p>Ecosia also assigns a Bing \u201cClient ID\u201d in order to improve the quality of the adverts.\nThis value is a user-specific ID, which is saved in the Ecosia cookie and retrieved during future visits.</p>\n<p>This enables Bing to display more relevant adverts from Bing or third-party suppliers from the Bing ad network for you, based in part on prior searches.\nThe legal basis for the data processing referred to Art.\n6 Para.\n1 S.\n1 lit.\nf of the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>\n<p>If \u201cDo not track\u201d is activated in your browser, the Client ID is automatically deactivated and neither saved nor sent.\nThe Client ID and personalised adverts can also be specifically switched off in the Ecosia search settings.</p>\n<p>For further details on the data processing of the Bing Ad Network, go to: https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement</p> Monitoring the success of advertisements via Ecosia on third-party provider platforms <p>We use several offerings of third-party providers Google, Facebook and Amazon, in order to call attention to ourselves with the help of advertising tools on external websites.\nIn relation to the data of the advertising campaigns, we can determine how successful the individual advertising measures are.\nBy doing so, we pursue the interest in showing you advertising which is of interest to you, we can shape our website in a way which is more interesting for you and we can achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.</p>\n<p>In some places, but never on search pages, Ecosia allows third-party providers to set cookies in order to check the success of Ecosia advertising campaigns.</p>\n<p>Based on the marketing tools used, your browser automatically forms a direct connection with the third-party provider\u2019s server.\nWe do not have any influence on the scope and the further use of the data which are gathered by the third-party provider.\nTherefore, we inform you in accordance with what we know: Due to their involvement, the third-party provider receives the information that you visited the relevant website of our internet presence or clicked on one of our adverts.</p>\n<p>If you are registered for one of the third-party providers\u2019 services, it may assign the visit to your account.\nEven if you are not registered or you have not logged in, it is possible that the provider may find out your IP address and other identifying characteristics and save them.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for this processing of your data is Art.\n6 Para.\n1 lit.\nf of the General Data Protection Regulation.\nYou may prevent the participation in this tracking process in various ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may configure your browser setting the way you want it and refuse the acceptance of third-party cookies or deactivate cookies in general.</li>\n<li>By deactivating the interest-related adverts of the provider, which are part of the self-regulation campaign \u201cAbout ads\u201d, via the link http://www.aboutads.info/choices</li>\n<li>By deactivating the function \u201cFacebook Custom Audiences\u201d for logged-in users at https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For further information on data protection in third-party suppliers which we commission to measure the success of our advertising measures, go to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google: http://www.google.com/intl/policies/privacy and https://services.google.com/sitestats/de.html.\nAlternatively, visit the website of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at:

Shield.\nhttps://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We never integrate tracking scripts or pixels into Ecosia search pages.\nTherefore, search data are never shared with third-party providers who are not directly connected with the provision of the search service.</p> 7.\nRefusal or withdrawal of the consent to processing of your data <p>If you have granted your consent to the processing of your data, you can withdraw this at any time.\nSuch a withdrawal influences the permissibility of processing of your personal data, on the basis that you have stated this to us.</p>\n<p>Insofar as we support the processing of your personal data on a balancing of interests in accordance with Art.\n6 Para.\n1 lit.\nf of the General Data Protection Regulation, you may at any time refuse the processing of data about you for reasons which arise from your specific situation.\nIn the event of a refusal, we will inspect the matter and will stop or adjust the data processing, unless we can provide compelling and legitimate grounds for the processing which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>\n<p>Of course, you may refuse the processing of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time.\nNo justification is required to do so.\nThis also applies to profiling if it is connected with such direct advertising.</p>\n<p>To assert a refusal or a withdrawal of consent, please contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@ecosia.org.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Data protection
