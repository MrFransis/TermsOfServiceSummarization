Services.\nIf you are a parent or guardian and you provide your consent to your child's registration with the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms with respect of your child\u2019s use of

solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not you authorized that activity.\nYou should immediately notify Plato of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your
