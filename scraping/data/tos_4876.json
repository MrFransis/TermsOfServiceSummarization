browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and our Product and Service providers to coordinate and record the activity and fill your requests for our Products and Services and information (\u201cUsage Information\u201d).\nWe collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.\nFor example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our TruGreen Applications, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device.\nBrowsers routinely send these types of information to web servers.\nIn addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (\u201cDevice Identifier\u201d) for your computer or other device used to access the TruGreen Applications (any, a \u201cDevice\u201d).\nA Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the TruGreen Applications, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.\nWe may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our TruGreen Applications and the website you visit after you leave our TruGreen Applications, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.\nWe may use this Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the TruGreen Applications.</p>\n<p>The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your Device(s), which are then transmitted back to our Site by your Device(s).\nThese servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.\nFor example, when you visit TruGreen Applications, we and our service providers may place cookies on your Device(s).\nCookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and may track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience.\nThey also help us detect certain kinds of fraud.\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the AHS Applications.\nSome cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with TruGreen Applications with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your interactions with TruGreen Applications.</p>\n<p>Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer.\n\u201cSession\u201d cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views.\nYour browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser.\n\u201cPersistent\u201d cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser.\nWe use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided.\n\u201cFlash\u201d cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.\nOur third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.\nFlash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.\nCookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a Persistent or Session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings.\nEach browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\nHowever, cookie management tools

function properly.\nFor instance, if cookies are disabled, you will not be able to log into the Site and therefore you will experience an anonymous user experience.</p>\n<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on the AHS Applications or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions.\nWhen you access the AHS Applications or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers.\nThese tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve the AHS Applications and promotions.</p>\n<p>We also use embedded scripts which are programming codes designed to collect information about your interactions with the TruGreen Applications, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the TruGreen Applications, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>\n<p>We use HTML5, another form of collection, in our apps for the iPhone or iPad (and any other Apple iOS device).\nHTML5 is another form of collection, tracking and storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.\nLike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies can be used to track users across website but are not stored in browsers\u2019 cookie files.\nTo our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.</p>\n<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information.\nFor example, we use information we collect about TruGreen Application users to optimize our Products and Services and understand traffic and usage patterns.\nIn other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information.\nWhenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information You Provide About a Third Party</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you send someone else a

included in the communication sent to your friend.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Collect From Third Parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We acquire information from other trusted sources to update or

confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>\n<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>\n<li>Detect

that impair existing intended functionality.</li>\n<li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>\n<li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.\nPenal Code \u00a7 1546 et.\nseq.).</li>\n<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or

research\u2019s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>\n<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided

a verifiable consumer request to us by sending us a message on our website.\nOnly you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.\nYou may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>\n<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>\n<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Response Timing and Format</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.\nIf we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>\n<p>We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt.\nThe response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the \u201cright to opt-out\u201d).\nWe do not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the \u201cright to opt-in\u201d) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.\nConsumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>\n<p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following our webpage and sending us a message.</p>\n<p>Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales.\nHowever, you may change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by visiting our website and sending us a message.</p>\n<p>We will only use personal information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels.\nAny CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information\u2019s value and contain written terms that describe the program\u2019s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>\n<p>California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law (Civil Code Section \u00a7 1798.83)
