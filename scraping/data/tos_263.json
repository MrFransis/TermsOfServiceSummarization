include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Service providers.\nFor example, we may use analytics service providers to analyze how you interact and engage with the Services, or third parties may help us provide you with customer support.</li>\n<li>Social networks connected to the services.\nIf you provide your social network account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third-party site or

our service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our Site, applications, products, services, advertisements or communications.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<strong>Optional Information</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Like any business interested in attracting and offering the highest quality of service to customers, Boingo gathers voluntary demographic information about our customers.\nThese questions seek to gain insight on such things as how an individual became aware of our service, their gender, occupation and travel preferences and practices.\nIn addition, customer comments and inquiries are collected and stored for each customer that submits them.\nThis information is collected and stored with the customer\u2019s individual Boingo account information.</p>\n<p>Boingo occasionally conducts user surveys to better target our service offering to existing as well as new customers.\nWe sometimes share aggregated demographic information in these surveys with various business partners.\nParticipation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</p>\n<p>Boingo has and may institute referral programs or similar programs, such as the \u201cTell a Friend\u201d program.\nBoingo\u2019s \u201cTell a Friend\u201d program allows customers to receive credit for each individual (a \u201cReferral\u201d) that, as a result of their recommendation, also becomes a customer.\nFor a customer to receive a free month of service under this program, (1) the Referral must become a subscriber to Boingo Unlimited and remain a subscriber of Boingo Unlimited for more than 31 days.\n(2) the Referral cannot be an existing Boingo customer.\nand (3) the Referral cannot have been previously submitted to the \u201cTell a Friend\u201d program by another person.\nExisting customers provide the e-mail address of the Referral, and Boingo may send an e-mail message to the Referral from the referring customer\u2019s e-mail address informing them of the Boingo service.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Geographic Location Information</strong>\n<p>When you use Boingo\u2019s services on a mobile device (such as your laptop or a smart

products, offerings and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>\n<p>To keep track of traffic on their servers, Web sites often store a small data file on your hard disk and/or device when you visit them.\nThis file is commonly referred to as a \u201ccookie.\u201d For detailed information on the cookies we collect, please visit our Cookie Policy.\nA cookie file can contain user specific information, such as User ID, or it can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over).\nThe Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, \u201ccookies\u201d) to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, and to diagnose problems on our server and administer our site.\nThe cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, that we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.\nCookies enable you to enter all parts of the Site, and are used to save your User ID on the login page (we encrypt the User ID for added security).\nIn addition, cookie files help us assist you with questions about site navigation, functionality or performance.\nPartners also may use their own \u201ccookies.\u201d We may supplement the

third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services.\nThese advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general

from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of third parties.\nSuch information may be gathered through tracking users\u2019 activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services.\nTo accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver cookies, including a file (known as a \u201cweb beacon\u201d) from an ad network to you through the Services.\nWeb beacons allow websites to track users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.\nWeb beacons also allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers and enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.\nWeb beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>\n<p>Boingo may use web beacons in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boingo may use web beacons within our Web sites in order to track customers signing up at one of our hotspot locations.</li>\n<li>Boingo may use web beacons within our Web sites in order to fulfill sponsored access campaigns or other promotions.</li>\n<li>Boingo may use web beacons to measure where customers leave the signup process in order to improve customer experience.</li>\n<li>Boingo may use web beacons to track customers that come through our Web sites from advertisements or search engines.</li>\n<li>Boingo may use web beacons to serve ads to customers after they leave our Web sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Boingo also records the MAC (Media Access Controller) address, IDFA, ADID and device identifier numbers from the network card in or used with your computer or other device to enable Boingo to accurately perform our billing functions and in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p>We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nThrough the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based a consumer\u2019s online behavior across different websites and properties.\nTo make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt-out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the DAA\u2019s or NAI\u2019s consumer opt-out pages, which are located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ or www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>\n<strong>Information Collected from Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</strong>\n<br>\n<p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.\nJust like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.\nYour browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites.\nOur Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online

or receiving communications from us and our partners.</p>\n<p>At any time, customers can contact Boingo to opt-out of any of our promotions, programs, location-tracking services or contests via the following link: https://selfcare.boingohotspot.net/unsubscribe.\nAlternatively, customers can opt not to provide certain information when enrolling for the Boingo service or when participating in some programs and surveys, although choosing not to provide certain information may hinder our ability to complete your registration process.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Personal Data of Children</strong>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from children under the age of 16.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age

privacy@boingo.com.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Security Measures</strong>\n<p>Your account information is protected by a unique User Identification and password that is issued to you.\nYour User Identification and password should be kept confidential because it is the key to accessing the information held by Boingo about you.\nIf your computer or other device is accessible to or by others, please log out of the Boingo site before you leave it.\nSecurity is also provided through your web browser, which supports 40, 56 or a 128-bit version of encryption with the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protocol.</p>\n<p>Boingo has instituted internal safeguards to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and unintended access of your information (although it is impossible to eliminate this possibility completely).\nIn general, all employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Boingo are contractually required, through signed, internal non-disclosure agreements, to keep your Personal Data confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Boingo.\nViolations of these policies can result in termination in the case of employees, the severing of contractual obligations in the case of contractors and other companies, and in civil and criminal penalties if warranted and applicable by law.</p>\n<p>While Boingo uses reasonable measures to protect the security of your information, no security measures are foolproof, and Boingo does not guarantee that your information will remain confidential.</p>\n<p>The Services may contain links to other sites.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites.\nWhen following a link to another site you should read that site\u2019s privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services.\nIn some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal or contractual obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation.\nWe may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Security of Third Party Networks</strong>\n<p>Because of the global nature of our services, there are some places where you cannot access the Boingo Wi-Fi Network.\nIn these places, you may (1) manually search for available third party networks and, if required to do so, assent to Terms of Service or other click-through agreements.\nor (2) connect to other people\u2019s Wi-Fi networks automatically by using the Boingo Wi-Finder tool if you opt-in to use this feature.\nPlease see our FAQs for more information about these options: http://www.boingo.com/faq/wifinder.</p>\n<p>Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves.\nWe do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Site or Boingo\u2019s services.\nThus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them.\nBefore visiting a third-party site, whether by means of Boingo Wi-Finder, manually searching for an available third party network or otherwise, and before providing any information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites</strong>\n<p>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we\u2019re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us).\nYou can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Data with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.\nOne such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account.\nWe have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business\u2019 or websites\u2019 policies.</p>\n<strong>California Resident Rights</strong>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights outlined in this section.\nPlease see the \u201cExercising Your

request.</p>\n<strong>Exercising Your Rights</strong>\n<p>To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are

not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age.</p>\n<strong>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</strong>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA.\nWe will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise

the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.</p>\n<br>\n<strong>Nevada Resident Rights</strong>\n<p>If you are a resident of Nevada, you have the

Privacy Policy at any time, and in any manner without notice, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Site, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.\nPlease note that if you\u2019ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven\u2019t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you shall

brief reminder of what a generic drug is: it is a medication that is manufactured with the same characteristics as its brand-name equivalent by a company that did not participate in the discovery of the original formula.Obviously then, the brand drug and its generics contain the same active substance in similar doses.</p> Generic Sildenafil Use and Mechanism of Action\n<p>Sildenafil is a substance for oral use that is safe, effective and appropriate for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.\nSildenafil can be used to treat impotence caused by organic, psychogenic, and mixed reasons.</p> Generic Sildenafil Online\n<p>If you prefer buying things online, you are in everybody\u2019s club: any item you wish for is at your fingertips, and the prices are easy to compare.\nAnd by the way, the cost of goods online is so much more attractive.\nSo can one buy Silagra and other pills with sildenafil online, too?</p> Browse Categories <strong> By Age and
