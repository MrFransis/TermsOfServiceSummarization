Resolution.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<em>\n<strong>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this section</strong>\n</em>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<strong>(\"Arbitration Agreement\")</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<em>\n<strong>carefully.\nIt requires you to arbitrate most disputes with Meredith and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.1 <u>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</u>\n</strong> You agree that any dispute between you and us relating in any way to the Services, our advertising or marketing practices, any Products sold or distributed through the Services, or this Agreement, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nand (2) you or Meredith may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).\n<strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<strong>IF YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATION WITH MEREDITH, YOU ARE AGREEING IN ADVANCE THAT YOU WILL NOT PARTICIPATE IN OR SEEK TO RECOVER MONETARY OR OTHER RELIEF IN ANY LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST MEREDITH ALLEGING CLASS, COLLECTIVE, AND/OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS ON YOUR BEHALF.\nINSTEAD, BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU MAY BRING COVERED CLAIMS AGAINST MEREDITH ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION PROCEEDING.\nIF SUCCESSFUL ON SUCH CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING WHETHER TO ACCEPT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</strong>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.2 <u>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</u>\n</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to John Zieser, General Counsel, Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.\nDisputes involving claims and counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS' most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.\nall other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.\nJAMS's rules are also available at www.jamsadr.comor by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and you cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meredith will pay them for you.\nIn addition, Meredith will reimburse all such JAMS' filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.<br>\n<br>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.3 <u>Authority of Arbitrator.</u>\n</strong> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Meredith.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and this Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement).\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.4 <u>Waiver of Jury Trial.</u>\n</strong> YOU AND MEREDITH HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT (OTHER THAN SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PERMITTED HEREIN) AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.\nYou and Meredith are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in section 15.1 above.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.5 <u>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</u>\n</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.\nONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the event that this section 15.5 is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor we shall be entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute and instead the applicable claim or dispute shall be resolved in a court as set forth in section 16.5.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.6 <u>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</u>\n</strong> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written

Meredith account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us, or may enter into in the future with us.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.7 <u>Severability.</u>\n</strong> Subject to section 15.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.8 <u>Survival of Agreement.</u>\n</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement or your relationship with Meredith.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>15.9

apply to any individual claim(s) of which you had already provided notice to Meredith.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.\nGeneral Provisions.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.1 <u>Electronic Communications.</u>\n</strong> The communications between you and Meredith use electronic means, whether you visit the Services or send Meredith e-mails, or whether Meredith posts notices on the

agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications and documents that Meredith provides to you electronically will have the same legal effect that such communications or documents would have if they were set forth in \"writing.\" The foregoing sentence does not affect your statutory rights.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.2 <u>Assignment.</u>\n</strong> This Agreement, and your rights and obligations hereunder, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated or otherwise transferred by you without Meredith's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.3 <u>Force Majeure.</u>\n</strong> Meredith shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.4 <u>Questions, Complaints, Claims.</u>\n</strong> If you have any questions, complaints or claims with respect to

of or relating to this Agreement will be litigated exclusively in the state courts in Polk County, Iowa or federal courts located in the Southern District of Iowa.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.6 <u>Governing Law.</u>\n</strong> THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OFIOWA, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICT OF LAW OR OTHER PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.\nTHE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.7 <u>Notice.</u>\n</strong> Where Meredith requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are responsible for providing Meredith with your most current e-mail address.\nIn the event that the last e-mail address you provided to Meredith is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you any notices required/ permitted by this Agreement, Meredith's dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice.\nYou may give notice to Meredith at the following address: Meredith Corporation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, IA 50309-3023, Attn: General Counsel.\nSuch notice shall be deemed given when received by Meredith by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight delivery service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.8 <u>Waiver.</u>\n</strong> Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.9 <u>Severability.</u>\n</strong> Subject to Section 15.5, if any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>16.10 <u>Export Control.</u>\n</strong> You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as authorized by U.S.\nlaw, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Services, and any other applicable laws.\nIn particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any United
