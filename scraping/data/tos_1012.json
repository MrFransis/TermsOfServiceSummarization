Access to Information</em>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that BetterHelp notifies you of the personal information about you that we have collected and used.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we will disclose to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>\n<li>The

you are, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you

the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal.\nPenal Code \u00a7 1546 <em>seq.</em>).</li>\n<li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>\n<li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>\n<li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n<li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Exercising Your Rights</em>\n</p>\n<p>To exercise the rights listed above, please submit a request in writing to BetterHelp via the contact information listed in the Contact Information section.\nOnly you, or a

you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>\n<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nMaking a request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Response Timing and Format</em>\n</p>\n<p>We endeavor to respond to a request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.\nIf we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>\n<p>For Requests to Access, our response will only cover the 12-month period preceding the request.\nThe response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\nWe will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Non-Discrimination <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nWe will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or
