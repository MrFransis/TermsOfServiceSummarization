processing</strong>\n<br>The data you provide when you place an order may be used to review whether the order transaction is atypical (e.g.\nsimultaneous ordering of a large number of goods to the same address using different customer accounts).\nIn principle, we have a legitimate interest in carrying out such a review.\nThe legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nIn order to prevent fraud, we use the services of BytePlant GmbH Software Solutions &amp.\nConsulting, Heilsbronner Strasse 4, D-91564 Neuendettelsau (hereinafter \u201cBytePlant\u201d) to operate our website.\nBytePlant uses cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and process data in order to identify the terminal device used by the user and other data about the use of the website.\nThese data are not associated with any specific users.\nWhere BytePlant collects IP addresses, these are immediately encrypted.\nBytePlant stores the data in a database for the purpose of fraud prevention.\nThis database also contains data transmitted by us to BytePlant relating to terminal devices that have already been used in cases of (attempted) fraud.\nThese data are not associated with any specific users either.\nWhen an order is placed on our website, we retrieve a risk assessment regarding the user\u2019s terminal device from BytePlant\u2019s database.\nThis risk assessment on the likelihood of attempted fraud takes into account, among other things, whether the terminal device has accessed the website via different service providers, whether the terminal device\u2019s georeference changes frequently, how many transactions the terminal device has made and whether it uses a proxy connection.\nThe legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b) Legal Basis for the Processing</strong>\n<br>\nThe processing of the transmitted data is based on

Recipients</strong>\n<br>\nThe recipients of the data are internal IT and BytePlant employees, being processors.\nWe have concluded a corresponding processing agreement with BytePlant for this purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e) Storage periods</strong>\n<br>\nData are processed for 14 days in this context.\nAfter this, they will be erased, provided that there are no legal obligations to keep records.\nIf you wish to contact us in this regard, please use the contact details provided at the beginning of this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>f) Legal/contractual requirement</strong>\n<br>\nIn principle, data subjects cannot exercise their right to object to the processing of personal data in the context of fraud prevention.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>g) Transfer to a

applicability of the General Terms and Conditions on the website, entering the requested details in the registration form provided and transmitting those details to the Supplier, the Customer (hereafter \u201cCustomer\u201d) declares acceptance of the validity of these General Terms and Conditions.</p> Art.\n2 Contract subject matter <p>\n<b>2.1.</b>The Provider will provide the Customer with technical access to the servers available from third parties for the global Usenet service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2.</b> The Provider, who does not operate own news servers, does not publish or administer himself, or through third parties, any content on the connected servers of the global Usenet service.\n</p> Art.\n3 Registration for the Service <p>\n<b>3.1.</b> Only natural persons of full age are entitled to register on the Website for access to the Service.\nLegal/juristic persons are excluded from Registration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.2.</b> The Provider is not obligated to accept a Customer as a member and reserves the explicit right to refuse any Registration or acceptance without providing reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.3.</b> With Registration for the Service, the Customer is obligated to provide the following personal data completely and correctly: surname, first name, address and telephone number, valid e-mail address and payment information according to the selected payment method (wire transfer, credit card, PayPal, iDeal).</p>\n<p>The Customer declares that he is the lawful owner of the payment information specified by him or an authorized representative.\nThe Customer shall be obligated to provide evidence of suitable power of attorney.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.4.</b>In order to be able to use the Service and member area on the Website, the Customer will receive a user name and password during Registration (hereafter \"Access Data\").\nFor access to the Service, the Customer requires an Internet-capable computer system and a program for reading the articles.</p> Art.\n4 Download quota <p>\n<b>4.1.</b> Prior to conclusion of the contract, the Customer must define with the Provider, the term of his contractual commitment and the monthly download quota.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.2.</b> The download quota is the data quantity that the Customer can transfer on a monthly basis, from Usenet, through third party servers, onto his computer.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.3.</b> If the Customer has fully utilised his download quota, he has the opportunity to access the affected quota for the following month under the \"More volumes\" option in the user area.\nThe length of the contract remains constant despite the time packages are downloaded.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.4.</b> Upon expiration of every monthly period, the unused portion of the download quota made available to the Customer shall also expire.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In the following situations, the claim to a proportional refund is excluded: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>With a lower or no data retrieval by the Customer, compared to the maximum quantity agreed for the respective month.\n</li>\n<li> If the download quota for the respective subsequent month is pre-empted, the download quota for the running, currently activate month will lapse.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The administration of the download quota and therefore the measurement of whether the quota for the currently activated month will be fully utilised, before the quota for the respective following month is pre-empted, or the respective following month begins, will exclusively be carried out by the Customer.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.5.</b> The Provider only provides the monthly agreed download quota within the technical service limits of the Service, under consideration of the provision of services agreed with other Customers.\nThe entitlement of the Customer to access the data of the quota for the following month is therefore not created automatically.</p>\n<p>The Provider has the right to limit the data transfer and possibly block the Customer\u2019s or third parties\u2019 access to the Website and to the Service, if the technical performance of the Service is impaired or the Provider has reason to assume that the Customer or third parties are using the Service in an unauthorised or abusive manner, particularly as described under Art.\n9.\nThe Provider will immediately inform the Customer by e-mail about such a measure.\nIf the Provider should not succeed in providing the contractually guaranteed quota for the respective month, the Provider will credit this quota for the subsequent month or extend the contract term by one month.\n</p> Art.\n5 Contract conclusion <p>\n<b>5.1.</b> By going through the signup process, the Customer imparts an offer to the Provider to conclude the contract.\nThe Provider reserves the right to reject this offer without reason.\nThe signup process is comprised of the following steps:<br>\n</p>\n<li>The customer provides his name and contact details using the signup form</li>\n<li>The customer selects a payment method and provides his payment details using the signup form</li>\n<li>The customer confirms his acceptance of the terms of purchase by marking the relevant checkbox</li>\n<li>The customer sends the accomplished signup form by clicking on the purchase button</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>5.2.</b> The contract between the

Customer.\n<br>\n</p> Art.\n6 Payment regulations <p>\n<b>6.1.</b> The applicable prices are those, which are valid at the time of contract conclusion and which the Customer has acknowledged upon conclusion of the contract.\nThe membership fee for the entire term of the contract is payable in advance.\nWhen payment is made via a SEPA direct debit mandate, the deadline for notifying the customer that the amount will be debited from their bank account is reduced to one day.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.2.</b> The Provider can adjust the prices for the agreed contractual services, subject to the following conditions.</p>\n<p>The Provider will notify the Customer by e-mail about planned price increases at least four weeks prior to them taking effect.</p>\n<p>From the time of receiving the notification regarding the price increase, the Customer has a right to cancellation until the time of the planned price increase coming into effect.\nIf no cancellation takes place within the prescribed period, the price increase will be regarded as accepted.</p>\n<p>The provider will exercise this right maximal one time per quarter to adjust fees and charges to changing market conditions, changes to the VAT rate, or significant changes in purchasing costs.</p>\n<p>Price falls come into effect from the announced date.\nFor the Customer\u2019s membership fees, a reduction will come into effect as of the following, contractually agreed time period, unless something different has been notified.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.3.</b> If the bank rejects a payment due for want of cover on the account or because the Customer cancelled the agreed direct debit, the Provider will invoice all arising expenses per rejected or cancelled direct debit.\nThis amount will increase by the respective bank fees, plus the amount that has been contractually agreed.\n</p>\n<p>If the Customer is more than ten days in default with his payment, or if the Customer has provided false or improper payment information to the Provider, the Provider shall be authorised to block access to the Service, after he has issued a reminder for the payment and pointed to the imminent blocking of the
