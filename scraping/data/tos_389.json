the Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision are for the ,court to decide.\nThe arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on the ,award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator can award the same damages ,and relief that a court can award, including the award of declaratory or injunctive relief.\nprovided, ,however, that any declaratory or

its provisions and, governs all questions of ,whether a Claim is subject to arbitration.\nIf any portion of this Dispute Resolution provision is ,determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the

reinforces our network with additional capacity in areas where growth trends identify a need.\nIf network congestion occurs, CenturyLink employs various techniques to ensure a positive customer experience and fair distribution of network resources.</p>\n<p>Currently, based on our experience, if CenturyLink customers encounter any congestion, it is typically during the hours of peak usage - between 7 p.m.\nand 11 p.m.\nlocal time.\nDuring peak hours, the majority of our residential customers are attempting to use the Internet simultaneously, giving rise to a greater potential for congestion.\nPeak usage will vary due to extraordinary conditions such as pandemics, weather events and/or national emergencies.</p>\n<p>When network congestion is identified, CenturyLink uses various techniques to create a good customer experience.\nOur network management techniques include preventing virus/spam delivery to customer email accounts.\nWe also reinforce our network with additional capacity in areas where congestion is identified or as part of standard network engineering design plans.\nIn some cases, we may limit the number of customers that can be served on a particular network node or, in very rare cases, we may need to downgrade the service available to existing customers&nbsp;until additional capacity can be added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The links CenturyLink and other networks use to exchange traffic may also become congested at times.\nCenturyLink devotes considerable resources to maintaining adequate traffic exchange arrangements with these other networks and has entered into commercially negotiated agreements to exchange traffic with them on mutually agreeable terms wherever possible.\nConsistent with its agreements with those other networks and its long-standing practices, CenturyLink will work to establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks on mutually agreeable terms when needed.\nBut, sometimes this is not possible due to circumstances beyond CenturyLink's control.\nFor example, in some instances, other networks refuse to make adequate arrangements.\nIn other instances where adequate arrangements are in place, some edge providers or their intermediaries (other networks) choose to route traffic in ways that result in congestion when there are other choices.\nIf CenturyLink is unable to reach agreement on the terms of its interconnection or network expansion with these other networks, or if some of these other circumstances occur, it could affect a customer's ability to upload or download data via Internet endpoints connected to those networks.\nUnfortunately, CenturyLink cannot guarantee that it will be able to establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks, or that subscribers will be able to upload data to or download data from Internet end points connected to other networks at any particular speed.</p> Application-Specific and/or User-Specific Policy <p>CenturyLink High-Speed Internet customers receive full access to all of the lawful content, services, and applications that the Internet has to offer.</p>\n<p>As described more fully below, CenturyLink deploys Type of Service (ToS) and Differentiated Service (DiffServe) capabilities at the customer modem and in limited network equipment deployed across the CenturyLink High-Speed Internet network for the CenturyLink Digital Home Phone service (a non-BIA or specialized service).\nAnd, the network equipment enabled with this capability will honor ToS and DiffServe settings of any third-party network consistent with the National Standards recommendations described in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 1349 and RFC 2474.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink does not otherwise block, prioritize, or degrade any Internet sourced or destined traffic based on application, source, destination, protocol, or port unless it does so in connection with a security practice described in the security policy section below.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink also deploys certain user-specific policies (i.e.\npractices that are applied to traffic associated with a particular user or user group).\nCurrently, these are limited to practices described above and the security practices described in the security policy section below.</p>\n<b>Device Attachment Policy</b>\n<br>\n<p>Customers have the flexibility of attaching any modem of their choice to their CenturyLink High-Speed Internet service provided that the modem supports the technology on which the customer is provisioned.\nCenturyLink will not support any modem-related issues for customers that attach a non-certified modem.\nA list of CenturyLink compatible modems can be found&nbsp;here.\nCustomers who choose to attach a modem approved by CenturyLink may contact our High-Speed Internet Technical Support&nbsp;Chat.</p>\n<p>Customers are encouraged to check the firmware in their modems to ensure that the latest version of firmware is downloaded.\nThis URL provides guidelines on how to upgrade your modem\u2019s firmware:</p>\n<p>https://www.centurylink.com/home/help/internet/modems-and-routers/update-your-modems-firmware.html</p>\n<p>CenturyLink customers may attach devices of their choice to the modem they select.\nAny attached devices must be used in a manner consistent with our Terms of Service and&nbsp;Acceptable Use Policy.</p>\n<p>Customers in areas where CenturyLink provides wireless hotspots can connect wirelessly using any device equipped with IEEE 802.11 protocol.</p> Security Policy <p>CenturyLink engineers are dedicated to managing our network to ensure that all customers receive the most secure online experience.\nWe use industry-leading security practices to manage our network, provide services to our customers, and ensure compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy and the terms of our High-Speed Internet agreement.\nThese tools and practices may change from time to time to keep up with the new and innovative ways that customers use the network and to keep up with changing network technologies.</p>\n<p>When malicious behavior is identified, CenturyLink engineers employ various techniques to help provide a positive customer experience.\nOur security management techniques include ensuring that customer systems are not propagating viruses, distributing spam email, or engaging in other malicious behavior.\nFor example, we use industry best practices to prevent virus/spam delivery to customer email accounts.\nWe provide antivirus and antimalware applications at no additional charge to our High-Speed Internet customers.\nWe also automatically detect and mitigate DoS (Denial of Service) attacks for our High-Speed Internet customers.\nWe block malicious sites and phishing sites to prevent fraud against our customers and to prevent our customers from getting infected via DNS (Domain Name Service) blackholing and Internet Protocol (IP) address blackholing.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right at any time to take action to protect the integrity and normal operation of our networks and to safeguard our customers from Internet threats, including fraud and other forms of abuse.\nSuch actions may include, but are not limited to, blocking, redirecting, or rate-limiting traffic using specific protocols, delivered over specific protocol ports, or destined for particular domain names or IP addresses associated with known malicious activity.</p>\n<p>Specific security practices deployed by CenturyLink may include but are not limited to:</p>\n<p>\n<b>IP Spoofing Prevention</b>\n</p>\n<p>The basic protocol for sending data over the Internet network and many other computer networks is Internet Protocol (IP).\nThe header of each IP packet contains, among other things, the numerical source and destination address of the packet.\nThe source address is normally the address that the packet was sent from.\nBy forging the header so it contains a different address, an attacker can make it appear that the packet was sent by a different machine.\nThe machine that receives spoofed packets will send a response back to the forged source address, which means that this technique is mainly used when the attacker does not care about the response or the attacker has some way of guessing the response.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink applies security measures to prevent an attacker within the network from launching IP spoofing attacks against these machines and flooding the network with unwanted data that can cause congestion.</p>\n<p>\n<b>DoS/Distributed DoS Monitoring and Mitigation</b>\n</p>\n<p>A denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack) is an attempt to make a computer unavailable to its intended users.\nAlthough the means to carry out, motives for, and targets of a DoS attack may vary, it generally consists of the concerted efforts of a person, or multiple people, to prevent an Internet site or service from functioning efficiently or at all, temporarily or indefinitely.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink applies various security measures to prevent someone within the network from launching DoS or DDoS attacks to ensure that customers can access the Internet when needed.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink may block or rate-limit connections on other ports that are commonly used to exploit other customers or non-customer computers.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink may block sites that are used in a malicious manner to infect customers, perform fraud against them and otherwise as needed to protect our network and our customers.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Port 25 Blocking</b>\n</p>\n<p>CenturyLink filters port 25 to reduce the spread of email viruses and spam (unsolicited email).\nEmail viruses allow malicious software to control infected computers.\nThese viruses direct the infected machines to send email viruses and spam through port 25.\nPort 25 filtering is a recognized Internet industry best practice for service providers like CenturyLink to filter e-mail traffic.\nThe Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group (MAAWG), a global organization focused on preserving electronic messaging from online exploits and abuse with the goal of enhancing user trust and confidence, recommends that \"providers block incoming traffic to your network from port 25.\"</p>\n<p>More information regarding CenturyLink's port 25 filtering policy can be found at&nbsp;<br>\nhttp://www.centurylink.com/home/help/internet/email/understanding-port-25-filtering.html.</p>\n<p>More information regarding the MAAWG Port 25 filtering best practices can be found at&nbsp;<br>\nhttp://www.maawg.org/sites/maawg/files/news/MAAWG_Port25rec0511.pdf.</p>\n<p>\n<b>UDP Port 1900 Blocking</b>\n</p>\n<p>CenturyLink may filter User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 1900 to prevent DoS attacks across the network.\nSSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) runs on UDP port 1900 and is part of the Universal Plug and Play (uPnP) protocol that allows discovery and configuration of devices on a local network.\nNormal use of the protocol is limited to a local network, but the protocol is used by attackers in reflective DoS across the backbone.</p>\n<p>\n<b>The CenturyLink Customer Internet Protection Program (CIPP)</b>\n</p>\n<p>CenturyLink has voluntarily undertaken a program to help curtail the spread of viruses and malicious software (malware), including botnets, and assist its customers whose computers are infected with viruses and malware.\nThe CIPP is available to CenturyLink residential and small business broadband customers on who subscribe to the CenturyLink High Speed Internet service and provides infection notification and assistance with the mitigation of virus and malware infections, including botnets, once such infections have been detected.\nCenturyLink proactively provides virus and malware notification, mitigation and security education for these broadband customers.</p>\n<p>The three goals of the CenturyLink CIPP are to: 1) automate the notification of virus-infected customers.\n2) assist customers in an online, self-help manner to clean their computers of infections.\nand 3) educate its customers about the dangers of viruses and malware and benefits of good Internet security practices.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink residential and small business broadband customers automatically receive this service at no additional charge.</p>\n<p>Upon notifying a customer of a detected infection, CenturyLink informs the customer of safe Internet security practices and offers the customer online self-help tools, if practical, to remove the infection from the computer.\nThe customer's unencrypted World Wide Web traffic is redirected to a walled garden to perform the notification.\nPorts commonly used to spread malware are blocked while the customer is in walled garden status.\nMost normal customer e-mail is not blocked while the customer is in walled garden status.\nThese customers have the option to immediately restore their Internet connection to normal service status at this point or continue through the process for mitigation of the infection.\nCenturyLink asks infected customers to review the Internet security information that CenturyLink has provided and to access the downloadable or online tools that will help them remove the virus or malware.</p>\n<p>The CenturyLink CIPP website also provides customers with links to virus and malware removal guides (http://www.centurylink.com/home/support/internetprotection/).\nIn some cases, customers may need to contact an anti-virus or anti-malware software provider to help them remove the virus or malware.\nIf a customer tries to remove a virus or malware and still has problems, the customer can call CenturyLink broadband technical support.\nhowever, if the customer has a malware infection, CenturyLink encourages the customer to get assistance from an anti-malware software provider.\nCenturyLink does not scan customers' computers for viruses or malware - nor does CenturyLink remove viruses or malware from computers for customers.\nFurther, CenturyLink does not scan or otherwise monitor customers' content.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Other security practices to address viruses or malware</b>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to protecting its own network, CenturyLink provides information to its customers to help them protect themselves when they are online.\nCustomers can find this information at&nbsp;http://www.centurylink.com/aboutus/legal/online-security.html.</p> Other Network Practices Description <p>The following section provides additional information with regard to certain services that CenturyLink offers its customers.</p>\n<p>In some areas where CenturyLink is a facility-based CLEC, CenturyLink

CenturyLink Web Helper FAQs at&nbsp;http://webhelper.centurylink.com/faq.php.</p> Performance Characteristics Expected Performance<br>\n<p>When you order CenturyLink High-Speed Internet access service, the service we quote you is based on an advertised \"up to\" connection speed.\nWe continually upgrade our network, but our quoted speed is based on the characteristics of the relevant network facilities at the time you order.\nWe will confirm your advertised speed at the time of installation.</p>\n<p>The actual throughput you experience may vary.\nDuring most periods, based on CenturyLink's evaluation, most customers, except for Fiber Gigabit customers subscribed to the up to 940Mb/s service as explained below, can generally expect average speeds at or above 95% of the advertised \"up to\" speed and many can generally expect speeds above that level.\nLess than 20 percent of customers can expect average speeds below 80% of the advertised \"up to\" speed.\nIn rare cases, average speed may be significantly less than this level.</p>\n<p>The service speed is provisioned between the network device and the in-premises modem and may vary due to physical condition of the line and other factors.\nThe percentage of throughput achieved will vary depending on the amount of bandwidth our network uses in delivering service to you, as well as other factors outside of CenturyLink control such as customer location, the quality of the inside wiring within the home, the websites accessed by the customer, usage of the network during peak periods of the day and the customer's equipment within the home or premises.</p>\n<p>Latency (the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another in a network) is also highly variable depending on the network path, other providers in the path, as well as the actual distance to the destination and performance of the end destination servers.\nIt generally increases with distance of the route between the source and destination and with any congestion on the route, and decreases as actual speed increases.\nCenturyLink measures latency by measuring the round-trip time from the consumer's home to the closest measurement server and back.\nCenturyLink High-Speed Internet customers should expect roundtrip latency to most general Internet sites in the range from 50-150 milliseconds.</p>\n<p>Packet loss (the percentage of packets that are sent by the source but not received by the destination) is also highly variable.\nThe most common reason that a packet is not received is that it encountered congestion along the route.\nA small amount of packet loss is expected, and indeed some Internet protocols use the packet loss to understand Internet congestion and to adjust the sending rate accordingly.\nCenturyLink denotes a packet as lost if the latency exceeds 3 seconds or if the packet is never received.\nCenturyLink High-Speed Internet customers should generally expect to experience packet loss at the rate significantly below 1% or at levels unlikely to significantly affect customer experience.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Fiber Gigabit Service</b>\n</p>\n<p>The ultrafast Fiber Gigabit service delivers a line rate of 1 Gbps* speed from the network to your location with an IP bandwidth throughput of up to 940Mbps via a wired connection.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nProtocols within the Fiber Gigabit service technology and Internet protocol consume a small portion (around 60Mbps) of the 1Gbps line rate for signaling and control to ensure the data is reliably delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAll devices within the home will share the available bandwidth throughput of the Fiber Gigabit service.&nbsp.\nIf multiple users or devices are connected to the service, any given speed test will show results of less than 940Mbps.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSpeed test results can be impacted by many factors, many of which are outside CenturyLink\u2019s control.&nbsp.\n* - Note:&nbsp.\n1Gbps = 1,000 Mbps.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Factors Impacting Internet Throughput</b>:&nbsp.\nThe items listed below are some of the more significant items which impact service throughput on an ultrafast Fiber Gigabit service (as well as all other High-Speed Internet services) but is not an all-inclusive list.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of devices connected to the customer\u2019s network - A customer can use one device or many devices to access the Fiber Gigabit Internet service.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhen multiple devices are connected to the Fiber Gigabit service, they will share the throughput provided to the service address.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nMultiple devices sharing the internet connection can affect the speed each device and its respective applications experience, depending on the applications being utilized.</li>\n<li>Customer\u2019s hardware \u2013 personal computer, laptop, handset, tablet, gaming device, etc.\nmust be capable of processing the throughput enabled by the Fiber Gigabit service.&nbsp.\nProcessor type, operating system, browser version, memory and hard disk size are several of the many attributes impacting overall throughput (See Connected Device Minimum Requirements section for recommendations on computer hardware).</li>\n<li>Internet backbone congestion \u2013 Internet congestion generally occurs in the late afternoon and late in the evening.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAccessing websites during congestion periods will limit the ability to recognize full service throughput.\nCongestion could occur outside of CenturyLink\u2019s network.</li>\n<li>Website connections to the Internet \u2013 website servers may not have Fiber Gigabit network speed connectivity to the Internet and are therefore not able to send requested data as fast as the Fiber Gigabit service being provided to you.</li>\n<li>Website servers \u2013 website servers may not have the memory or processor power to send data at Fiber Gigabit speeds to the

the CenturyLink gateway and customer equipment.&nbsp.\nEnsure eight wires are connected from the cable to the RJ45 connector on each end of the cable.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThe wires can be visible through the transparent connector on each end of the cable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Wireless Configuration:<ul>\n<li>Wireless speeds will vary due to many factors such as Wi-Fi radio enabled on the gateway, Wi-Fi radio on the receiving device, environmental conditions, type of hardware device connecting to the service, the operating system of the device and distance between the Wi-Fi radio and the device receiving the bandwidth.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSee \u201cWireless Factors Impacting High-Speed Internet Throughput\u201d section below for further detail.</li>\n<li>The Fiber Gigabit service will only deliver up to 940Mbps of throughput over a wired connection and a generally expected throughput of up to 400 to 600 Mbps via a wireless connection.&nbsp.\nThe full throughput cannot be experienced over Wi-Fi radios due to 802.11ac Wi-Fi technology limitations (see Wireless Factors Impacting High-Speed Internet Throughput section).&nbsp.\nAs Wi-Fi standards progress beyond the currently available 802.11ac standard, it is expected that the new Wi-Fi 6 standard (802.11ax) could be capable of delivering 940Mb/s wireless throughput once it becomes available in the consumer electronics industry and integrated into gateways and end user devices, potentially as early as end of 2019 or beginning of 2020.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>To optimize wireless throughput, CTL recommends the following:<ul>\n<li>Place Wi-Fi enabled CenturyLink gateway in a centralized location to maximize coverage, away from any devices that generate signal frequencies (microwaves, etc.)</li>\n<li>Ensure the gateway has an unobstructed path to where most of the wireless devices will be operating&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Minimize the number of wireless devices connecting to the gateway, turn off devices if not in use</li>\n<li>Use 802.11ac radios with the 5GHz channel enabled</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Wireless Factors Impacting High-Speed Internet Throughput</b>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Wireless throughput in the home will vary due to many factors, including Wi-Fi radio used, environmental conditions, the number of devices connected via the wireless signal, and distance between the Wi-Fi radio and the receiving device (e.g., laptop, computer, tablet, mobile phone, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThe device receiving the throughput can also impact the throughput by the configuration of hardware (e.g., operating system, processor, memory, etc.).&nbsp.\nAdditional details regarding some of the more prevalent factors impacting wireless throughput are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Environmental Limitations: walls (brick, normal drywall construction, etc.), metal cabinets, windows and HVAC duct work are a few of the many construction materials that degrade Wi-Fi signals.&nbsp.\nEach building has unique properties that may degrade the wireless throughput.</li>\n<li>Distance from CenturyLink gateway \u2013 the atmosphere (air) between the gateway and the receiving wireless device degrades the wireless signal.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIn general, the greater the distance from the gateway to the receiving device, the slower the speed.</li>\n<li>Type of Wi-Fi Radio:&nbsp.\nThere are several types of Wi-Fi radios readily available in the marketplace.&nbsp.\nThe most prevalent in the marketplace are versions 802.11b, g, n and ac.&nbsp.\nThe higher the letter/letter combination at the end of the 802.11 version, the higher the speed.&nbsp.\nBoth the sending and receiving devices must be enabled with the same radios to achieve maximum throughput expected for any specific radio type.&nbsp.\nWhen two different radio types are being used between sending and receiving devices, the lower speed version will determine maximum throughput.&nbsp.\nTo maximize wireless throughput, CenturyLink recommends using 802.11ac enabled devices to achieve the greatest expected throughput range for the High-Speed Internet service, particularly when subscribing to the Fiber Gigabit service.&nbsp.\nSee the table below regarding maximum theoretical and generally expected throughput by Wi-Fi radio version.&nbsp.\n\u201cGenerally Expected Throughput\u201d is a guideline, but wireless service performance will vary based on each customer\u2019s unique environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wi-Fi Radio Version</p>\n<p>Theoretical Maximum Throughput*</p>\n<p>Generally Expected Throughput</p>\n<p>802.11b</p>\n<p>11 Mbps</p>\n<p>&lt;11 Mbps</p>\n<p>802.11g</p>\n<p>54 Mbps</p>\n<p>12 \u2013 20 Mbps</p>\n<p>802.11n</p>\n<p>600 Mbps</p>\n<p>40 - 60 Mbps</p>\n<p>802.11ac</p>\n<p>1.7 Gbps</p>\n<p>400 \u2013 600 Mbps</p>\n<p>* - Maximum theoretical throughput is defined through the IEEE 802.11 standard.&nbsp.\nThe industry standard is created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN/MAN Standards Committee (IEEE 802):&nbsp.\nhttp://www.ieee802.org/11/</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of devices connected wirelessly:&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIn general, the more wireless devices connected to the service, the slower the wireless connection will be.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWireless radios generally see a reduced throughput as more devices are connected to a gateway but is dependent upon each manufacturer\u2019s design.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThis is due to processor and antenna resource allocation within the Wi-Fi radio.&nbsp.\nAs more devices get connected, the radio\u2019s resource allocation to any one device generally is decreased.</li>\n<li>The use of Wi-Fi Extenders / Mesh devices to improve coverage:&nbsp.\nthe use of Wi-Fi extenders or mesh devices are used to increase the Wi-Fi signal coverage.\nHowever, each extender / mesh device may impact overall wireless throughput depending on the specific solution used.&nbsp.\nTo optimize the Wi-Fi network throughput using Wi-Fi extenders or mesh devices, confirm Wi-Fi radio type is consistent with the CenturyLink Gateway.\nThen consult the respective Wi-Fi extender or mesh user manual(s) to validate throughput capabilities, ensure proper configuration and adherence to equipment placement recommendations.</li>\n<li>Number of other Wi-Fi networks in close proximity:&nbsp.\nmultiple Wi-Fi networks working in close proximity can cause signal interference and throughput issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If, after purchasing your service, you

on the speed purchased, bandwidth required for the application, and time of day usage of the application.</p>\n<p>Network speeds for CenturyLink High-Speed Internet services provided over wireless hotspots may vary.\nThe performance the user experiences, once they connect, may vary based on any number of factors, such as the maximum bandwidth allocated for Wi-Fi services, the number of other users trying to use the same Wi-Fi at the same time, the user's computer or wireless device, the Wi-Fi receiving antenna, and the distance from the Wi-Fi router.\nThese Wi-Fi routers use spectrum that the FCC has allocated for \"unlicensed\" use, which means that, like wireless routers used for in-home networking, the use of this spectrum is not protected from interference from other devices using the same spectrum in the same geographical area.\nThis makes it inherently difficult to predict what kind of performance you can expect.</p> CenturyLink Non-Broadband Internet Access

channels delivered over the company's advanced, managed network.\nPrism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV is built on an interactive platform, where updates are made automatically to offer customers a better combination of TV entertainment features compared with cable and satellite.\nCenturyLink<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV provides access to more than 240 all-digital channels, including Hispanic and international channels, as well as Pay per View and Video on Demand.\nPrism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV service is available in a number of different packages to meet various customer needs.</p>\n<p>Customers may purchase Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV in a bundle with CenturyLink<sup>\u00ae</sup>\n<br>\nHigh-Speed Internet<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;service.\nCustomers choosing this bundle will receive their Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV video content over the same broadband connection as they receive their High-Speed Internet service.\nIn order to provide a consistently high-quality video service, Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV traffic is assigned a higher service priority than public Internet traffic (i.e.\nrelative to a Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV customer's public Internet traffic on transmission paths dedicated to the Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV customer and relative to all public Internet traffic on those portions of the CenturyLink last mile broadband network architecture that support both Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV and access to the public Internet).\nThis prioritization technique only applies during times of congestion over that last-mile connection.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink is also committed to providing its customers with the best online experience.\nWhen network congestion is identified, CenturyLink engineers employ various techniques to ensure a positive customer experience.\nCenturyLink reinforces its network with additional network capacity in areas where congestion is identified or as part of standard network engineering design plans.\nIn some cases, we may limit the number of customers that may be served on a particular network node until additional capacity can be added.\nAlso, a significant portion of the CenturyLink last-mile broadband network architecture that supports CenturyLink High-Speed Internet service consists of a dedicated broadband connection to the home.\nBut, as a result of the network practices described in this section, a Prism\u00ae&nbsp;TV customer's public Internet throughput speed may be temporarily reduced when the customer accesses a Prism\u00ae&nbsp;TV provided streaming or VOD video.\nIt is also conceivable that other CenturyLink High-Speed Internet service customers who live near Prism\u00ae&nbsp;TV subscribers could see slower broadband speeds relative to the performance of Prism\u00ae&nbsp;TV traffic on the same network architecture during certain times of overall network congestion.</p>\n<p>Prism\u00ae&nbsp;TV customers can also access their video content using eligible devices other than the set-top box (such as tablets and smart phones).\nThis can be done using the Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV App and via either a CenturyLink or a third-party broadband connection.\nIn either case, the Prism\u00ae&nbsp;video content accessed by Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV customers using the Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV App is not prioritized over public Internet traffic.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;Prism<sup>\u00ae</sup>&nbsp;TV customers can find additional disclosures regarding their services on the CenturyLink

as needed to meet our business goals or fulfill our legal obligations.\nWe protect the information we have about our customers, and we require those we share it with to protect it, too.\nWe use information generated on our networks to manage those networks, to plan for future development, and to keep our services running reliably and efficiently.\nFor example, we monitor data to check for viruses, to control spam, to prevent attacks that might disable our services, to ensure that your traffic does not violate your subscriber agreement or our acceptable use policies, and to guard against other inappropriate or illegal activity.\nThis may involve looking at the characteristics of our network traffic, such as traffic volumes, beginning and ending points of transmissions, and the types of applications being used to send traffic across our network.\nIn limited circumstances, we need to look into the content of the data (such as the specific websites being visited, files being transmitted, or application being used) for the purposes described above, in circumstances when we are concerned about fraud or harassment, to repair a problem we detect or that a customer contacts us about, or when we are providing the content of broadband traffic to law enforcement which we only do as authorized by law.</p>\n<p>You can find more detail about our information gathering practices

and data protection regulations in general.\nTo ensure our services and customer support align with our customers\u2019 own compliance efforts, we have a GDPR compliance program in place, that leverages our robust security, privacy and compliance infrastructure.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink has customers in more than 60 countries, including multinational organizations that use our services worldwide.\nTo us, GDPR is not an EU-only matter, but rather an important data protection standard that affects our customers operating in the EU and beyond its borders.\nAlthough based in the U.S., CenturyLink recognizes the need to satisfy regional requirements and provide global solutions to our customers.\nGDPR requires mutual dependencies and cooperation between customers and service providers, and we believe those requirements will strengthen our relationships with customers.</p>\n<p>For more information, please click here.</p> GDPR FAQs What measures did CenturyLink specifically undertake to achieve compliance and raise awareness about GDPR\u2019s requirements? <p>CenturyLink undertook a comprehensive GDPR compliance initiative led by a cross-functional team with members of our Legal and Information Security departments.\nThe team worked with third-party experts and representatives of all our business units to assess and address CenturyLink\u2019s obligations under GDPR.\nCenturyLink\u2019s senior leadership fully supported those efforts and is committed to our GDPR compliance.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink\u2019s approach to GDPR compliance focuses on accountability and demonstrating compliance now and in the future.&nbsp.\nWith that in mind, the GDPR compliance team took a long-term view to data protection and designed its data protection initiatives to be able to adapt as CenturyLink grows and new data protection laws emerge around the globe.</p> What is CenturyLink\u2019s approach to cross-border data flows and the export of personal data outside the EU? <p>CenturyLink\u2019s exportation of personal information from within the EU to other countries generally is covered under standard contractual clauses.\nWhenever our services require us to export personal data subject to GDPR, CenturyLink will make the necessary contractual arrangements with our customers to ensure compliant data transmission.</p> How will CenturyLink handle requests for summaries and diagrams of data flows? <p>CenturyLink offers several products, many of which are customizable, to customers in more than 60 countries, so we do not maintain universal summaries or diagrams of data flows.\nCustomers can gain an infrastructure-level view of how and where the data flows from the relevant product documentation and each customer\u2019s specific network or solution design.&nbsp;</p> Under what lawful basis (e.g., obtaining consent, legitimate interests, etc.) will CenturyLink process data under GDPR? <p>CenturyLink\u2019s enterprise services rarely, if ever, require direct contact between CenturyLink and individual data subjects protected by the GDPR.\nIf we process any personal data, it will be either on instructions from a customer (the \u201ccontroller\u201d as defined by GDPR) or when CenturyLink acts as the controller in accordance with the legal grounds defined in Section 6 of GDPR.</p> What is GDPR\u2019s effect on CenturyLink\u2019s specific products? <p>CenturyLink has undertaken a review of our products to assess their potential for processing personal data.\nIn addition, we are committed to regularly reviewing our products for this purpose.\nIn most cases, CenturyLink does not have access to personal data, including information that is transmitted, stored, hosted or processed through a customer\u2019s use of our products\u2019 functions.\nHowever, whenever necessary and consistent with the nature of our services, we will assist our customers in meeting their obligations under the GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are CenturyLink\u2019s procedures for providing notice of data breaches?</b>\n</p>\n<p>CenturyLink will provide notifications of breaches to all of our customers likely affected by a breach in accordance with legal requirements and as agreed with our customers.\nWhen a breach is suspected, CenturyLink takes the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Determine if a breach occurred</li>\n<li>Research and identify products the breach may affect</li>\n<li>Identify and notify our customers potentially affected by the breach</li>\n</ol>\n<p>CenturyLink\u2019s level of access to information affected by a breach, including the specific data and data subjects, varies from product to product.\nAs a result, the amount of information in breach notifications will vary accordingly.</p> What are CenturyLink\u2019s policies and procedures regarding data retention, destruction, and/or return? <p>Whether or how much personal data CenturyLink can return or destroy depends on the functionalities of the product processing the data.\nFor instance, we do not access, host, store or process the content of messages or other information traveling in our network, so we cannot return copies of such data.</p>\n<p>However, when the data involves services where CenturyLink operates as a processor, such as information storage and hosting products, we will grant customers access to the data for retrieval or destruction.\nIn most of these cases, we do not have access to information but will help customers as appropriate to address their GDPR obligations relating to retention, destruction and retrieval of data processed by CenturyLink products.\nTypically, customers will have full control of these activities through the tools and functionalities available with the products.</p> What GDPR-related language will appear in CenturyLink contracts with customers? <p>Depending on the specific CenturyLink product and customer arrangement, CenturyLink acts as controller, processer or both.\nAs such, we will make the necessary contractual arrangements to comply with GDPR.\nWe will address general GDPR obligations at the master agreement level.\nIn specific cases of personal data processing by our services, we will address contractual language as appropriate.</p> CenturyLink Details of Processing for Services CenturyLink Details of Processing

"/html/body/div[1]/div/div[2]/section/div/div/div/div[1]", "text": " CenturyLink Settlement-Free Peering Policy <p>Revised April 7, 2020</p>\n<p>CenturyLink is a global communications and IT services company, operating in over 60 countries and focused on connecting its customers to the power of the digital world.\nWhile interconnection with the CenturyLink network is generally handled commercially, there are a small number of internet networks with which it may be mutually beneficial for CenturyLink to enter into a settlement-free interconnection, or \u201cpeering,\u201d agreement.&nbsp.\nCenturyLink has developed this policy to provide guidelines for the selection of peers on a global or regional basis.\nCenturyLink selects peers based upon, among other things, relative size and scope of network, complementary reach of peer networks and the overall strategic benefit CenturyLink will experience with the connection.\nCompliance with the technical and operational requirements set forth in this policy does not guarantee a peering relationship with CenturyLink.&nbsp.\nPotential peers should allow for a minimum of two weeks for CenturyLink to provide a preliminary response to a request related to peering.</p>\n<p>CenturyLink evaluates this policy on an ongoing basis and reserves the right to make changes to it at any time in its sole discretion.&nbsp.\nThis peering policy is only a guideline, not an agreement or a set of rules governing a specific peering relationship.&nbsp.\nPeering may only occur pursuant to an agreement executed between CenturyLink and the peer that sets forth details related to interconnection architecture, port capacity, dispute resolution and operational matters, among other things.&nbsp.\nCenturyLink may require a trial peering interconnection arrangement with potential peers.\nSuch a trial will only occur subsequent to execution by both parties of a Peering Trial Agreement.\nA successful peering trial, however, does not guarantee that CenturyLink will agree to a longer term peering agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>General Principles for Settlement-Free Peering</b>\n<p>The following general principles serve as the foundation for the specific settlement-free peering qualifications set forth below in this policy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The backbone cost burden associated with settlement-free peering traffic exchange should be equitably shared.\nRegardless of the direction or type of traffic exchanged between the networks, the routing practices and location of interconnection points should be such that each party bears a reasonably equal share of backbone costs.</li>\n<li>The primary objective of a peering arrangement is to enable each party to deliver high-quality service to its customers.</li>\n<li>The interconnection architecture and traffic exchange practices should assure that the exchange of traffic is resilient, scalable and secure.</li>\n<li>Any termination or modification of a peering arrangement should be managed by both parties in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to each party\u2019s customers and to the overall operation of the internet.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>Qualifications for Potential Peers</b>\n<p>CenturyLink will consider settlement-free peering with candidates that meet the following criteria:</p> a.\noperate an IP network between the interconnection points and utilize Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to govern the exchange of traffic at those interconnection points for all internet traffic, regardless of source, destination or technology used to deliver traffic (including IPv4 and IPv6 internet traffic).\nb.\nhave a professionally managed 24x7x365 NOC capable of repairing or otherwise remedying any problems within a reasonable timeframe, cooperating to resolve security incidents, denial of service attacks and other operational problems.\nc.\nmust provide 48 hours notice to CenturyLink NOC for scheduled maintenance.\nd.\nuse the same peering autonomous system AS at each interconnection point and announce a consistent set of routes at each point, unless CenturyLink agrees otherwise.\ne.\nannounce only routes for paid traffic exchanged with its customers.\nf.\nfilter route announcements from its customers by prefix.\ng.\nnot to abuse the peering relationship by engaging in activities such as, but not limited, to pointing a default or static route or otherwise forwarding traffic for destinations not explicitly advertised, resetting next-hop or selling or giving next-hop to others.\nh.\nprovide paid internet transit service to at least 1000 unique transit networks utilizing BGP on a global basis or 250 unique transit networks utilizing BGP on a regional basis where CenturyLink agrees that peering is limited to interconnection points and traffic that are contained within a single geographic region such as Asia, Europe, Latin America or North America.\ni.\nexchange at a minimum 500 Gbps (in either direction) of internet traffic on a global basis or a minimum of 250 Gbps (in either direction) of traffic on a regional basis for arrangements where CenturyLink agrees that peering is limited to interconnection points and traffic that are contained within a single geographic region such as Asia, Europe, Latin America or North America.\nj.\naugment capacity with sufficient lead time to ensure uncongested flow of internet traffic for steady state as well as failure scenarios.\nk.\nagree to interconnect in any market that constitutes greater than 2% of global traffic volume between networks and where the potential peer holds the required regulatory authority to do so and can legally operate.\nl.\nprovide tools (e.g., a public looking glass or route server) to enable diagnosis of the peering relationship and have an up to date PeeringDB record.\nm.\nagree to settlement-free interconnection with Centurylink in all markets in which it operates.\n<p>If after reviewing these requirements, should a candidate network feel these requirements are met or achievable, please send a peering request to

(\"Claims\") against each other, including but not limited to Claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any CenturyLink Products, billings, or advertisings</b>.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and applies to, among others: all Claims regardless of whether they are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\nall Claims that arose prior to your use of a CenturyLink Website or prior to this Agreement.\nall Claims that arise after you ceased using a CenturyLink Website or after the termination of this Agreement.\nall Claims you may bring against CenturyLink's employees, agents, affiliates or other representatives.\nand all Claims that CenturyLink may bring against you.\nThe sole exception to this arbitration agreement is that either you or CenturyLink may, in the alternative, bring Claims in a small claims court having valid jurisdiction.\nYou and CenturyLink agree, however, that neither CenturyLink nor you will join any Claim with a claim or claims of any other person(s) or entity(ies), whether in a lawsuit, arbitration, or any other proceeding.\nYou and CenturyLink agree that no Claims will be asserted in any representative capacity on behalf of anyone else, that no Claims will be resolved on a class-wide or collective basis, that no arbitrator or arbitration forum will have jurisdiction to adjudicate or determine any Claims on a class-wide or collective basis, and that no rules for class-wide or collective arbitration will apply.<ol>\n<li>\n<b>(1)&nbsp;</b>\n<u>Arbitration Procedure</u>.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\" or \"Notice of Dispute\").\nThe Notice to CenturyLink should be addressed to: 1801 California Street, Suite 900, Denver, Colorado 80202, Attn: Legal Department (\"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must: (1) describe the nature and basis of the Claim.\nand (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf CenturyLink and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or CenturyLink may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nA single arbitrator engaged in the practice of law will conduct the arbitration.\nThe arbitration will be filed with the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), the arbitrator will be selected according to the AAA's procedures and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\"FAA\"), and Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision and the AAA's rules in effect when the Claim is filed.\nClaims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and CenturyLink agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.\nThe arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your Claim.\nArbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of the location where you reside.</li>\n<li>\n<b>(2)&nbsp;</b>\n<u>Arbitrator's Authority</u>.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitrator's authority is limited to Claims between you and CenturyLink alone.\nThe arbitrator has no authority to join or consolidate Claims, or adjudicate joined or consolidated Claims, unless you and CenturyLink agree in writing.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes provision are for the court to decide.\nThe arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator can award the same damages and relief that a court can award, including the award of declaratory or injunctive relief.\nprovided, however, that any declaratory or injunctive relief may only be in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual Claim.</li>\n<li>\n<b>(3)&nbsp;</b>\n<u>Costs of Arbitration</u>.\nYou will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought the Claim in court.\nWe will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\nYou are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses.\nIf the arbitration proceeding is decided in CenturyLink's favor, you shall reimburse CenturyLink for the fees and costs advanced to you only up to the extent awardable in a judicial proceeding.\nIf the arbitration proceeding is determined in your favor, you will not be required to reimburse CenturyLink for any fees and costs advanced by CenturyLink.\nIf a party elects to appeal an award, the prevailing party in the appeal shall be entitled to recover all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that appeal.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes p&nbsp;rovision, CenturyLink will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.</li>\n<li>\n<b>(4)&nbsp;</b>\n<u>Changes</u>.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if CenturyLink makes any future change to this Dispute Resolution provision (other than a change to the Notice Address listed above) during the period of time that you are using or accessing CenturyLink Websites, you may reject any such change by sending CenturyLink written notice within 30 days of receiving notice of the change.\nYour rejection notice must be sent to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.\nNo changes, however, that are made to this provision after either party has submitted a Notice of Dispute shall be effective as to your and CenturyLink's pending dispute and/or arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n<b>(5)&nbsp;</b>\n<u>Governing Law, Enforcement, and Waivers</u>.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, and not state law, applies to this Dispute Resolution provision and its provisions and, governs all questions of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration.\nIf any portion of this Dispute Resolution provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provision remains in full force and effect.\nIf for any reason, the above provisions on arbitration are held unenforceable or are found not to apply to a Claim, you and CenturyLink waive the right to a jury trial on your respective Claims, and waive any right to pursue any Claims on a class or consolidated basis or in a representative capacity.\nIf any party files a judicial or administrative action asserting a Claim that is subject to arbitration and another party successfully stays such action or compels arbitration, the party filing that action must pay the other party's costs and expenses incurred in seeking such stay or compelling arbitration, including attorneys' fees.<br>\n&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>General.</b>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>\n<u>Notice</u>\n</b>.\nIf we send you a notice, it will be considered given when deposited in the U.S.\nMail

other written or oral statements do not change this Agreement.\nNeither the course of conduct between you and CenturyLink nor trade practices will act to modify any provision of this Agreement.\nCenturyLink may assign its rights and duties under these terms to any party at any time without notice to you.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid,
