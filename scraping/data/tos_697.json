information collected or submitted when you access, install, or use the Nord Services.</p>\n<p>All definitions and capitalized words used in this Privacy Policy are defined here or in our General Terms.</p>\n<p>By visiting our websites, by submitting your personal data to us, and by accessing, installing and/or using the Services, you confirm that you have read this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy.\nIf you disagree with the rules of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.</p>\n<p>Information in this Privacy Policy is provided in layers, meaning that all information related to our general personal data processing practices is provided here.\nMeanwhile, additional Service-specific information applicable to separate Nord products or websites are accessible via links in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Processing of your data</p>\n<p>Nord processes user data to a limited scope \u2013 for provision of the Services, processing payments for the Services, as well as the functioning of our websites and mobile applications.\nWe process the following basic information:</p>\n<p>Information for creating your account</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email

related information</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payment data (if using paid Services).\nThis information is necessary to collect payments for our Services.\nIn addition to the traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, users can buy our Service with cryptocurrency.\nOur payment processing partners process basic billing information for payment processing and refund requests (such as date of purchase, payer\u2019s IP address, zip code, card owner's full name and credit card information).\nWe also process some of the same payment information ourselves (e.\ng., card owner's full name, last few digits of your credit card) in cases of recurring payments.</li>\n<li>Country details.\nWhen providing your payment details, we ask our users to provide the country where they are registered, have a permanent address or usually live.\nThis information is necessary for VAT calculation purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Communication data</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email address.\nWe use your email address to: i) send you important updates and announcements related to your use of our Services.\nii) respond to your requests or inquiries.\niii) send you offers, surveys and other marketing content (you can opt-out of those at any time).</li>\n<li>Communication optimization data.\nWe use various tools to help us optimize our emailing campaigns.\nThese tools may track events you perform with an email, such as open and unsubscribe.\nWe may also be able to see the user device\u2019s operating system (e.g., windows, mac, ios, android) in order to optimize push notifications.</li>\n<li>Chat-bot.\nIf you contact us via our chat-bot on our website, in addition to collecting your contact information, we will be able to see your IP address.\nThis additional information is necessary for our support to determine the user's country and to see if the user is connected to our servers or not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information collected on our website</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access logs.\nAs most websites on the internet, our website collects access logs (such as IP address, browser type, operating system) to operate our services and ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance.\nThis information is also essential for fighting against DDoS attacks, scanning and similar hacking attempts.</li>\n<li>Cookies.\nCookies, pixels and other similar technologies are usually small text or image files that are placed on your device when you visit our website.\nSome cookies are essential for our website to operate smoothly.\nothers are used to improve website functionality or analyze aggregated usage statistics to improve website performance (as in the case of Google Analytics cookies).\nWe also use affiliate cookies to identify the customers referred to the website by our partners so that we can grant the referrers their commission.\nYou can check what cookies we use in the detailed cookie table that is accessible here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional information per product</p>\n<p>As our products cater to different user needs, they may collect different data points during their performance.\nThe following links provide further information on:</p>\n<p>NordVPN</p>\n<p>NordPass</p>\n<p>NordLocker</p>\n<p>Sharing your personal data</p>\n<p>We do not share your personal information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Service providers.\nWe use third-party service providers to help us with various operations, such as payment processing, email automation, website and app diagnostics, analytics and other.\nAs a result, some of these providers may process personal information.</p>\n<p>Some of our main long-term service providers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live chat and support service platform \u2013 Zendesk (provided by Zendesk Inc.);</li>\n<li>Emailing service providers \u2013 Iterable (by Iterable Inc.), Sendgrid (by Twilio Inc.);</li>\n<li>Application analytics and diagnostics \u2013 Google

privacy policies will apply to such relationships.</p>\n<p>Your personal information may be processed in any country in which we engage service providers.\nWhen you use our Services, you acknowledge the transfer of your personal information outside of the country where you reside.</p>\n<p>Requests for data.\nAny request for user data should follow an appropriate legal process to be recognized by the laws of the Republic of Panama.\nBeing based in Panama allows us to keep no logs of users\u2019 online activity (no IP addresses, browsing data, traffic information, etc.).\nThis means that we are unable to link an individual user to a specific IP address, connection timestamp or other information that we do not collect.\nTherefore, even in cases we receive a rightfully served request, it might be impossible for us to identify a specific person or provide any identifying information related to that person.\nIn cases where, following an appropriate legal process, we are able to identify a specific person, we will provide the limited data we process per our Privacy Policy.\nDepending on a specific case, this may include user\u2019s email, payment information (date of purchase, payment method and available details), subscription period, password expiration date or a country the user chose when registering for the Services.</p>\n<p>Choices related to your data</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to edit your profile information, delete your account or data, or request to provide you with a copy of your personal information, please contact our support team.\nPlease note that you may need to pass through a couple of account verification steps so that we can verify you are the owner of the account.</p>\n<p>If you wish to unsubscribe from our communication, you can opt out at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of each message or contacting us at privacy@nordaccount.com.</p>\n<p>You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nTo disable cookies, follow your browser\u2019s instructions on how to block or clear cookies.</p>\n<p>Some browsers have incorporated a \u201cdo-not-track\u201d feature that can send a signal to the websites you visit, indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nCurrently, our systems do not recognize browser \u201cdo-not-track\u201d requests.</p>\n<p>If you disagree with the processing of your data by Nord, please do not use our Services.\nYou can request us to discontinue processing your personal data, in which case your data will be processed only as much as it is necessary to effect the discontinuation of your use of the Services (e.g., final settlement, or deleting all personal data based on your email address), or finalizing other Nord\u2019s legal relationship with you (e.g., record keeping, accounting, processing refunds).</p>\n<p>If you wish to use the Services again, you will have to accept and agree to this Privacy Policy anew.</p>\n<p>Data security</p>\n<p>We take data security very seriously and take all steps reasonably necessary to secure your data (whether technical, physical, or administrative).\nHowever, no company can guarantee the absolute security of internet communications.\nBy using the Services, you expressly acknowledge that we cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through the Services and that any information received from you through the website or our Services is provided at your own responsibility.</p>\n<p>Information for users in the European Economic Area (EEA)</p>\n<p>The European Union's General

third-party rights, and any circumstances that may not have been reasonably controlled or foreseen.</p>\n<p>Our website may include links to other websites whose privacy practices may be different
