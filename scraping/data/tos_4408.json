NumberPrivacy Policy<p>The foundation on which we built Doosra is that you own your data.\nIn this policy, we lay out what data we collect, the rationale behind it and how your data is handled.\nThis policy applies to all products built and maintained by Ten20 Infomedia Private Limited.</p>Information Collection<p>We are a privacy-focused company and our thesis is to collect the least amount of information needed to deliver the product to you.\nBelow are the aspects of data collection that you should know about:</p>Identifiers<p>During the sign-up process, we ask for your primary mobile number, name and an email address(which is optional).\nSince Doosra is a virtual number, you can choose to forward certain calls to your primary number.\nWe may also send important SMSes to your mobile number (account expiry, OTP verification during sign-up or other essential information) from time to time.\nWe use the name to personalise your account and to address you in communication.\nThe email address is optional and used to send over relevant product updates from Doosra.\nWe will never sell your personal information to any third party.\nPeriod.</p>Billing data<p>We use a 3rd party payment processor for all payments made to Doosra.\nThat third party (may), at the time of first payment, mandates certain information such as mobile number and email.\nThat\u2019s so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices.\nYour credit card is passed directly to the payment processor and doesn\u2019t go through our servers.\nWe keep a record of the transaction to help with any clarifications or questions in the future.</p>KYC data<p>Certain products such as Doosra Pro require users to undergo the standard e-KYC process.\nThis is done to ensure our services are compliant with prevailing regulations.\nWe store the user\u2019s picture along with the copy of the identity proof.\nboth of which are mandatory to conduct an effective e-KYC.\n&nbsp;Upon termination of the user, the data is deleted as per the \u201cData Management upon deletion\u201d policy described in this document.</p>Geo-location data<p>We keep a log of all accounts access by IP address so that we can always verify that no unauthorized access has ever happened.\nThis data is retained with us as long as the account is active.\n<br>We also log full IP addresses during the sign-up process forever to eliminate or reduce unauthorised or fake sign-ups.\n<br>Web analytics tools are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with any troubleshooting needs in the future.<br>\n</p>Website interactions<p>When you browse our web pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which OS and browser version you are using.\nWe track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, to optimize the performance of the website, mobile apps and to test new product offerings or designs.\nWe may also track specific click-streams to help inform some design decisions.<br>\n</p>Cookies<p>We do use persistent first-party cookies and approved 3rd party cookies from web analytics tools to store certain preferences, making it easier for you to use our applications.\nA cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more.\nYou can adjust the settings in your own browser.<br>\n</p>Outreach<p>When you write Doosra with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the phone number and email address (if provided to us), so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.<br>\n</p>What information we do not collect<p>We don\u2019t collect any demographic, psychographic or personally-identifiable information (other than those described in the Section: Identity and Access - when writing into our Support team.)<br>\n</p>Information access and sharing<p>Our default practice is to not access your information.\nThe only times we\u2019ll ever access or share your info are:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide products or services you\u2019ve requested<br>\u200d</strong>We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties.\nNo Doosra human looks at your data for these purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To help you troubleshoot and resolve a software issue, with your permission</strong>\n<br>If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses</strong>\n<br>Accessing a customer\u2019s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort.\nWe have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us.\nWe do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.\nIf we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</li>\n<li>\u200d<strong>When required under applicable law</strong>\n<br>If the appropriate law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, or court order requiring us to share data, we have to comply.\nAnd unless we\u2019re legally prevented from it, we\u2019ll always inform you when such requests are made.&nbsp;If Ten20 Infomedia Private Limited is acquired by or merged with another company \u2014 we\u2019ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>Data location<p>Our products and other web properties are operated in India.\nIf you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of India, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to India.\nBy using our site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.<br>\n</p>Data security<p>All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser.\nThe database backups are also encrypted.\nAll messages sent to your Doosra\u2019s servers are encrypted and can be decrypted with the key generated for your account on your mobile app.\nThe people at Doosra do not have access to those messages.\nOther data is not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.<br>\n</p>Data management after deletion<p>In many of our applications, we give you the option to trash data.\nAnything you trash on your product accounts while they are active will be kept in an accessible trash can for up to 30 days (it varies a little by product).\nAfter that, the trashed data are no longer accessible via the application and are deleted from our active servers within the next 30 days.\nWe also have some backups of our application databases, which are kept for up to another 30 days.\nIn total, when you trash things in our applications, they are purged within 90 days from all of our systems and logs.\nWe also delete your data after an account is cancelled.<br>\n</p>How do we resolve complaints?<p>In compliance with the local laws, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.\nIndividuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact privacy@doosra.io, or by mail at Ten20 Infomedia Private Limited, 5th Floor, Gutenberg IT Park, Kondapur, Hyderabad, 500084, Telangana,

also announce them on our website.\n<br>Have any questions, comments, or concerns about this privacy policy, your data, or your rights with respect to your information?
