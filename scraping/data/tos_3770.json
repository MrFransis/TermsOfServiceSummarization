financial services provider.\nJust like we aim to remove all friction from your payment related matters, we believe your privacy can\u2019t just be an afterthought.\nThe world today is complex and confusing enough.\nWe\u2019re not here to add to that.Read Klarna's Privacy PolicyPrivacy supportMaking your data work for you.<p>Great experiences shouldn\u2019t have to come at the expense of your privacy.\nYour data helps us provide you with an intuitive, quick and automated experience so you can stop worrying about how long it takes to make a payment, and spend more time doing the things you love.</p>Being open.<p>We always strive to tell you about our data practices.\nThat\u2019s why this page is aimed at providing you with a useful and digestible overview on our data protection practices, on top of our more extensive privacy notice.</p>Meeting our responsibilities.<p>When you\u2019re sharing your data with us, we know you trust us to do what\u2019s right.\nAs a financial institution, we need to comply with a number of data practice rules.\nWe take this extremely seriously and always keep your best interest at heart when complying with these.</p>Your data.\nYour rights.<p>We understand that your data is...well, your data.\nAnd when it comes to getting insights on our privacy standards, how we collect, use and store your data, and how you can control each of these steps, we believe it should be as simple as possible.</p>Offering security and support.<p>When it comes to trust, we know that giving you our word just isn\u2019t enough.\nThat\u2019s why we continuously work to introduce new ways to keep your data safe via our advanced security system and provide you with adequate support if you have privacy related questions.</p>\n<p>We know that your time is valuable which is why we have summarized some of the key themes from our privacy notice in the following section.\nFor more detailed information please read our privacy policy.</p>\nOur Privacy Policy in short.Background<p>Depending on your relationship with Klarna and where you reside, different portions of our Privacy Policy may be applicable to you.\nSome personal information that Klarna possesses is governed by the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.&nbsp.\nAdditionally, if you are a California resident, some personal information we hold may be subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act.&nbsp.\nWe have tried to make clear which rights apply to your personal information depending on your relationship with Klarna.</p>\nWhat is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?<p>The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is a federal act that created various federal privacy and security requirements for financial institutions in 1999.\nFor example, you have the right to receive a Privacy Policy when you initiate a financial relationship with us.\nGLBA also required financial institutions to implement security controls to safeguard your data that is in our possession.</p>\nWhat is the California Consumer Privacy Act?<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is an act that was passed by the California legislature in 2018.\nIt took effect on January 1, 2020.\nIt provides individuals with privacy rights that are similar to existing rights under GLBA.\nHowever, the rights under CCPA apply to all California residents, unlike GLBA rights, which apply to customers or consumers of financial institutions.</p>\nWhat is the relationship between California Consumer Privacy Act and Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act?<p>The CCPA includes an exception for personal information that is collected, processed, or disclosed pursuant to GLBA.\nThis is because as a consumer of our GLBA products or services, you already have many of the rights under the CCPA.</p>\nThe type of data we use<p>When you use Klarna, there\u2019s two ways we receive your personal data: There\u2019s personal information you provide when you interact with us (e.g.\nwhen you provide your name and contact information, or when you utilize one of our services that use cookies or similar technologies) and there\u2019s personal information we collect about you from a variety of other sources (e.g.\ncredit and fraud prevention agencies, or stores).</p>\n<p>Personal information you share with us could for example include</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your contact- and identification information \u2013 we need this information to be able to for example confirm your identity, offer you support, or carry out a credit assessment before granting credit.</li>\n<li>Your payment information \u2013 we need this information to for example carry out transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personal information we collect about you could for example relate to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name, e-mail address, telephone number, postal address, device identifiers, IP addresses, and financial account information that you provide, such as credit or debit card numbers.</li>\n<li>Information about the interaction between you and Klarna \u2013 This could include information on how you use our service or your repayment history with Klarna, which we use to tailor our products to you, offer you support or carry out credit risk assessments before granting credit.</li>\n</ul>\nWhy we use your data<p>As we continuously work to elevate your shopping experience, we may use your data for a number of reasons, including to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify your identity when you use our services or contact us</li>\n<li>Engage with you as a customer</li>\n<li>Provide you with the services you requested</li>\n<li>Personalize content and experiences, including providing recommendations based on your preferences</li>\n<li>Understand your eligibility for Klarna products and services</li>\n<li>Communicate information on the products we offer</li>\n<li>Conduct customer satisfaction surveys</li>\n<li>Carry out credit and fraud assessments</li>\n<li>Perform debt collection services</li>\n<li>Perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of the Klarna Services and their purchasing patterns</li>\n<li>Prevent IT attacks</li>\n<li>Meet regulatory and legal requirements</li>\n</ul>\nHow we use data to build a better service for you<p>As we\u2019ve mentioned above, we believe your data should enhance your everyday life.\nBelow you can find some examples of how the personal data that you share with us, benefits you:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Paying with Klarna: </b>When you use one of our pay now, pay later, or financing services or use our one-time card (available in the app), we will carry out a credit check internally and via third parties, retrieve your contact and identification information and information about the interaction between you and Klarna.\nThis allows us to have a better understanding of your financial circumstances and your eligibility for certain products so as to provide you with the best options.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Autofill: </b>When you decide to purchase a certain item, we offer you the possibility to save your contact- and identification information and payment information so you don\u2019t need to manually add them with every purchase.\nYou can choose to opt out of this feature in the \u2018autofill settings\u2019 during address registration in your purchase checkout or by reviewing the support section below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Klarna app: </b>When you use the Klarna app through the mobile app or a web portal, we may collect information on your overall interactions with the app, your past purchases, your transactions via bank accounts you have connected, as well as items you\u2019ve liked in the past or chosen to add to your Klarna app.\nThis is so we can improve our app experience, provide you with a more personalised in-app experience, such as the ability to track your deliveries, make you aware of price drops for items you\u2019ve marked, remind you of upcoming payments, or give you a personal financial overview.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Support: </b>To be able to offer you efficient and personalised support, we collect your contact- and identification information and an overview on previous conversations.\nThis is so we are able to follow up on your questions and increase the speed at which we handle your inquiries.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Safe shopping: </b>When you use Klarna\u2019s services we collect your contact- and identification information, payment and financial information, device information, information on goods and services provided, as well as information about the interaction between you\u2019ve had with Klarna or stores, to be able to protect you against fraud and prevent attempts of money laundering.\nThis is so you can feel safe when using Klarna and we can be sure that you\u2019re really who you claim to be when managing your finances.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Communication and offers: </b>If you\u2019ve used Klarna in the past, we may also be collecting contact- and identification information, information about previous purchases and previous conversations with our support staff, as well as device information.\nThis is so we can reach out to you about new offers, products you might be interested in and updates you may be interested in.\nYou can easily opt out of these subscriptions by following steps laid out below.</p>\nHow you can control what information we collect and how we use it<p>There are a number of ways you can control the data we collect as well as the way we use it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Autofill: </b>Within the Klarna app you can choose to opt out of the Auto-fill feature which automatically fills in relevant information when you make future purchases.\nYou can choose to opt out of the feature in the \u2018autofill settings\u2019 during address registration in your purchase checkout or by reviewing the support section below.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Marketing communication:</b> In order to unsubscribe from marketing sendouts you can easily click on the \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 link at the bottom of each email.\nYou can also reach out to us by email where you state your wish to opt-out from receiving marketing send outs.\nFor all contact information, please review the support section below.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Identification:</b> You can personalise how you would like us to verify your identity before each purchase within the Klarna app.\nSimply go to the Klarna app and choose \u201cSettings\u201d/\u201dPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity\u201d</li>\n</ul>\nExporting, removing &amp.\ndeleting your information<p>Klarna retains information about you as a customer in order to provide you with our services.\nYour specific rights as a consumer may vary depending on the type of information, and where you reside, and are fully described in our Privacy Policy.\nIn general you retain the right to:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request a copy of the data we collect about you</b> \u2013 You have the right to request a copy of your personal data.\nIn order to do so, please review the support section below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request that we rectify inaccurate or incomplete information about yourself</b> \u2013 In case you perceive information referring to you to be wrong or incomplete, you have the right to request the information to be rectified or completed.\nIf you want to make such changes, you simply contact us via our 24/7 chat or by contacting our support team, describing your request.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Terminate a product, service, or your whole relationship with Klarna </b>\u2013 You are able to manage, or terminate, most of our product and services directly in the Klarna app.\nBy terminating a product or service you thereby terminate the connected terms and conditions.\nShould you have any questions on how to terminate a product or service, you are welcome to chat with us 24/7 via the app.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Request deletion of your personal data</b> \u2013 You have the right to request for personal data \u2013 that Klarna is not obliged to keep \u2013 to be deleted.&nbsp.\nPlease note that as a consequence, you won\u2019t for example receive any marketing material from us nor be able to log in to our web portal or mobile app once this process has been completed.\nIf you wish to request your personal data to be deleted,&nbsp;please review the support section below.</p>\n<p>If you wish to limit specific type of data you share with us, you can e.g.\nalways opt out from marketing sendouts, (see section \u201c<i>How you can control what information we collect and how we use it</i>\u201d)&nbsp;or remove certain products or services you have been using (see section \u201c<i>Terminate a product, service, or your whole relationship with Klarna\u201d</i>).</p>\n<p>\n<i>Retention of certain data</i>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that there may be instances where access to data or the right to delete specific information may be limited.\nFor example, as a financial institution, we are required to retain certain data by law, for example for Anti-Money Laundering purposes.\nIn addition to legal requirements, we may also retain certain information to protect both you and us, e.g.\nfor fraud prevention purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Identification before receiving access or erasure of data</i>\n</p>\n<p>In order to exercise your right to have your data erased or your right of access to your personal data, Klarna will need to identify you via, for example, via your identification information and information only you would have access to.\nAs a countermeasure to wrongfully disclose or delete personal data, we will always be required to properly identify you first.</p>\nHow and when we share your data<p>Depending on the service you wish to use, we may need to share some of your data with a select number of third parties, for example partners (cloud computing platforms, payment service providers or online selling platforms) or authorities.\nTo give you some examples, the reason for this may be so we can store your data safely, administer your purchases with stores, abide by regulatory requirements, prevent fraud, carry out credit risk assessments, or to communicate with you via a non-Klarna platform (e.g.\nFacebook or Twitter).</p>\nCompliance<p>When you choose to share your data with us, we know you trust us to do the right thing.\nDoing the right thing not only means keeping your best interest in mind but also complying with applicable laws and requirements.\nAnd when it comes to how and when we use your data, there are many rules governing such practices.\nA more recent example includes complying with the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA), a law regulating data protection and privacy for all California Residents.</p>\n<p>Being a financial institution, we also need to comply with a number of additional rules, for example the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) setting out how we may use and protect your financial information..\nUnder these rules we are sometimes required to store certain information or share details with public authorities when ordered to do so.</p>\n<p>We take these responsibilities extremely seriously and always work to keep your best interest in mind when assessing how to best comply with them.</p>\nKeeping your data safe<p>We heavily invest in our advanced security system which continuously monitors our systems to report any suspicious activity.\nWhen you use Klarna, it\u2019s important you know that before we even begin building our products, we go at length to assess any potential risks that could exist and strive to design the necessary countermeasures to make sure you stay safe.\nOf course we encrypt your data where appropriate, while making sure that only the right people have access.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Privacy Support</b>\n</p>\n<p>Do you have any privacy related questions or wish to receive more information on your data? We\u2019re here to help.\nDepending on your inquiry there\u2019s two ways you can contact us:</p>\n<p>For any inquiries relating to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requesting a copy of your data</li>\n<li>Deleting your data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please email privacy@klarna.com and state your request.</p>\n<p>For any other inquiries, for example relating to terminating a specific product or service, or rectifying any inaccurate or incomplete information about yourself, you can get speedy support in our 24/7 chat function which you can find in the app or on our website.\nAlternatively you can also contact our support team who will be happy to assist you with any other questions.</p>\nCountryUnited StatesAustraliaAustriaBelgium (fr)Belgium (nl)CanadaCanada (fr)DenmarkFinlandFranceGermanyInternationalItalyNetherlandsNew ZealandNorwaySpainSwedenSwitzerland (de)Switzerland (en)Switzerland (fr)Switzerland (it)United KingdomUnited StatesKlarna<p>About us</p>\n<p>Careers</p>\n<p>Legal</p>\n<p>Press</p>\n<p>Extra O blog</p>\n<p>Privacy</p>\n<p>Email connect</p>\n<p>Sustainability</p>Customer<p>Buy now pay later</p>\n<p>Contact us via app</p>\n<p>Customer service</p>\n<p>Klarna stores</p>\n<p>Shopping app</p>\n<p>Rewards club</p>\n<p>Feedback and complaints</p>\n<p>Shopping inspiration</p>Business<p>Sell with Klarna</p>\n<p>Payment methods</p>\n<p>Platforms and partners</p>\n<p>Partner program</p>\n<p>Business login</p>\n<p>Business support</p>\n<p>Operational status</p>\n<p>Monthly financing through Klarna is issued by WebBank, member FDIC.\nCopyright \u00a9 2005-2021 Klarna Inc.\nNMLS #1353190, 629 N.\nHigh Street, Third Floor, Columbus, OH 43215.\nOther CA resident loans made or arranged pursuant to a California Finance Lenders Law license.</p>\n<p>Legal</p>\n<p>Terms</p>\n<p>Privacy policy</p>\n<p>Cookies</p>\n<p>Sitemap</p> Your PrivacyWhen you visit any website, it may store or retrieve information on your browser, mostly in the form of cookies.\nThis information might be about you, your preferences or your device, and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to.\nThe information doesn't usually directly identify you, but it can give you a more personalized experience.\nBecause we respect your right to privacy, you can choose not to allow some types of cookies.\nClick on the different category headings to find out more and change our default settings.\nHowever, blocking some types of cookies may impact your experience of the site and the services we're able to offer.\n<br>More InformationAllow All Manage Consent PreferencesNecessary tracking technologiesAlways Active<p>These tracking technologies are necessary for the website to function and can\u2019t be switched off in our systems.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these tracking technologies, but it could result in parts of the site not working properly.</p>Performance tracking technologies Performance tracking technologies <p>These tracking technologies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site.\nThey help us know which pages are the most and least popular, and see how visitors move around the site.\nThey also help us understand where our users are coming from.\nIf these tracking technologies are declined, no user specific information related to our site performance will be stored.</p>Functional/Personalization tracking technologies Functional/Personalization tracking technologies <p>These tracking technologies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalisation to make the content of the site more specific for you as a user.\nIf you don\u2019t allow these tracking technologies, all of the functions we use to personalise the site will not function properly.</p>Targeting tracking technologies Targeting tracking technologies <p>These tracking technologies may be set and used by our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites.\nThey don\u2019t store personal data, but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device.\nIf you don\u2019t allow these tracking technologies, you will experience less targeted advertising.</p>Back Button Performance Cookies<p>\n</p>Vendor Search Search IconFilter IconClear checkbox label labelApply CancelConsent Leg.Interest checkbox label label checkbox label label checkbox label label Save Settings<p>We use cookies to make the website work, personalize content and ads, and to analyse our traffic.\nWe also share information about your use of our site with our social media, advertising and analytics partners.</p>Manage Details Accept", "created_at": "2021-05-24 21:06:55.424714", "updated_at": "2021-05-24 19:12:07.716764"}], "points": [], "urls": ["klarna.com", "app.klarna.com"]}}
