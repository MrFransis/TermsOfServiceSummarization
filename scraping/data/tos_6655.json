(1)</strong> - The NurseryCam Parental Webcam system is the ONLY nursery webcam system that encrypts every single image before it leaves your nursery.\nImage encryption prevents anyone from tapping onto the phone line and eavesdrop the images.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Virtual Private Network 3DES (2)</strong> - VPN is a technology that makes a secure tunnel for the transmission of data.\nIt is usually used by large companies to transmit confidential data from one office to another.\nWhile each image is encrypted, this secure tunnel provides an extra security layer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Secure Socket Layer 128-bit (3)</strong> - Every parent's login password and all information sent out from the NurseryCam Parental Webcam is encrypted with the military-graded 128-bit SSL protocol.</p>\n<br> 5.1.2 Secure Parent Accounts <p>\n<strong>Individual Parent Account (6)</strong> - Each parent has an individual password account.\nNo account sharing is allowed, even between mum and dad.\nThis enables us to closely monitor each account and catch any suspicious activity.\nIssuing of lost/stolen passwords will be restricted to an automated process.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Parent login history (7)</strong> - We have developed a proprietary, patent-pending login system where parents can see their last twenty logins including information on login status, location, source and network.\nAny suspicious activity within their account can be spotted immediately.\nNurseryCam is proud to have pioneered this innovative security monitoring function - one that it is not matched, even by online banking systems.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Secure Parent Account Application Process (8)</strong> - Every parent has to obtain a secret PIN from their nursery before being able to submit an application through our secure application process.\nThe account is only activated after the application has been reviewed and approved by the nursery management.\nIn this process, not even the nursery owner knows the parent's account password.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic Log-out functions (9)</strong> - To prohibit unauthorized access to the NurseryCam Parental Webcam from an unattended computer, each account automatically stops image updates and has timed log-outs after five minutes.</p>\n<br> 5.1.3 Secure Nursery Control Panel <p>\n<strong>Full control over Parent Accounts (10)</strong> - Nursery managers have full control of all parent accounts and cameras.\nOnly the authorized manager can approve, suspend or delete parent accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Full control over Room and Time Access (11)</strong> - Your nursery will limit individual parent's viewing access to only the room(s) his/her child is in (e.g.\nBear Room and garden) and the time his/her child attends the nursery (e.g.\nMonday and Wednesday afternoons only).\nPlus, you can limit the maximum viewing time per day.</p>\n<br> 5.1.4 Secure Central Server Protection <p>\n<strong>Watchdogs (4)</strong> - Watchdogs are programmed to routinely check all gateways and detect any suspicious activity or multiple failed attempts.\nIf detected, our security staff are immediately alerted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Firewalls (5)</strong> - Firewalls are used to prevent unauthorised internet users from accessing NurseryCam servers.\nEach message entering or leaving the NurseryCam servers are examined and those that do not meet our specified security criteria are automatically blocked.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24 Hours Security Monitoring (12)</strong> - Our dedicated monitoring team operates 24/7 to ensure that the highest security standard is maintained at all times.\nAn abused account would be suspended immediately and dealt by our security personnel directly.</p>\n<br> 5.2 Storage and Retention of Parental Webcam Images <p>Data and images associated with parental webcam will not be retained and shall be deleted as soon as possible, when the purpose of the data and images are fulfilled.</p>\n<br> 5.3 Access to
