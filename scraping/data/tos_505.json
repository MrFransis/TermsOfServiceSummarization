U.S.\nCopyright Office, the Writer\u2019s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.&nbsp;Further, you understand that if you contribute User Content under a Team, the Team Owner will own\u2014and be entirely responsible for\u2014all such User Content.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, \u201cIntellectual Property Rights\u201d means all patent rights, copyright rights,

with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your User Content and Canva\u2019s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not

might in any way impair the rights granted by you hereunder.</li>\n<li>If your User Content contains or incorporates in any manner any components including but not limited to&nbsp;design elements, fonts, clipart, sprites, vectors&nbsp;or brush tools and the like that are included in design programs, by uploading any such User Content to Canva, you represent and warrant that the end user license agreement, terms of service or the equivalent license agreed to by you allows you to incorporate such elements in the User Content created by you, and to license such User Content to Canva for the purposes set forth herein.</li>\n<li>Your User Content is neither obscene, sexual or pornographic, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable.</li>\n<li>To the best of your knowledge, all your User

using keywords which compete with Canva\u2019s own campaigns in order to promote your relationship with Canva nor will you use or engage a third party on your behalf to use Canva in any domain name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Upon making or learning of any claim that is inconsistent with any of the representations or warranties made by you, Canva shall send you written notice of such claim, using the email address provided by you to Canva, specifying the details of the claim as then known to Canva.\nPending the determination of such claim, Canva may withhold from royalties and/or other compensation due to you hereunder, such sums as are reasonably related to the probable value of the claim as determined by Canva.</p>\n<p>Canva takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts, publishes&nbsp;or prints over or using the Service.\nYou shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing and printing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content.\nYou understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content or Stock Media that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Canva shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content, Stock Media or your use of either in printed form.\nIn the event that your User Content is alleged to be offensive, inappropriate for children, unlawful or otherwise in breach of these terms, you agree that Canva may disclose such User Content to&nbsp;law enforcement or other government authorities.</p>\n4.3 User Content on Canva Print\n<p>In some countries, you may be eligible to order prints of your User Content on Canva Print, as part of the Services.\nYour use of Canva Print is subject to these terms.</p>\n<p>Canva has engaged third party supplies who will be responsible for completing your print order once you submit a print order using the Service.\nWe do not control these third party supplies and your order may, from time to time, be affected by circumstances outside of Canva\u2019s control.&nbsp;If you experience any issues, please visit Canva Print Customer Service.\n&nbsp;Please do not provide our third party suppliers with your personal information at any time.</p>\n<p>You may order using Canva Print at your own cost, with such cost to be calculated and included as part of your fee.\nUnfortunately, we cannot guarantee delivery times for orders using Canva Print.\nIf we provide you with a delivery time, it is an estimate only and we are not responsible or liable for any delays with shipping.\nYou agree to hold harmless Canva and its third party suppliers for any loss, cost or expense that you incur&nbsp;in connection with your use of Canva Print.</p>\n<p>By printing User Content on Canva Print, you agree to take steps to verify that the User Content does not contain or consist of anything that is prohibited under these terms or is otherwise unlawful.&nbsp;You agree that this is not the responsibility of Canva or its third party suppliers, despite Canva and its third party suppliers having the right to refuse your order (which right you acknowledge).</p>\n4.4 User Content in the Community\n4.4.1 Community\n<p>The Community is a forum located at http://community.canva.com (\u201cCommunity\u201d) for Users that wish to discuss or view online discussions on Canva\u2019s services and products.\nCommunity members can share and view information, questions and comments from other Users, as well as follow, message and recognise other Users and review and recognise their posts (\u201cCommunity Content\u201d).\nCommunity Content will become public globally (including places without the same data protection as where you live).</p>\n4.4.2 Community Guidelines\n<p>To participate in the Community, you must be over 16 and comply with the Community Guidelines, as amended from time to time.</p>\n4.4.3 Retention of Community Content\n<p>Please carefully consider the

comply with these Terms of use and our Community Guidelines or maintain the quality of the Community in Canva\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n4.4.6 Third Party Content\n<p>If you share a third party\u2019s content on the Community, you must ensure you are permitted to do so under the laws applicable to you (including having a licence or their consent) and provide attribution (unless the third party waives this right or hasn\u2019t consented to their personal information being shared on the Community).\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We welcome you to upload content to Canva, but we don\u2019t allow anything that is offensive, obscene, or could constitute or contribute to a criminal or civil offense, including copyright and other Intellectual Property Right violations.<br>\nIf you want to contribute content to Canva to be licensed to other Users in exchange for royalties, you must agree to the Canva Contributor Agreement.<br>\nYou promise that you have all necessary permissions and rights to submit the content you provide to us, and that your content won\u2019t infringe anyone\u2019s rights or violate any laws.\nYou promise that your information is truthful.\nWe\u2019re not responsible for your content in any way.<br>\nYou\u2019re also promising:<br>\n\u2013 You have sufficient rights to use everything you submit.<br>\n\u2013 Your content is appropriate for use on our Service.<br>\n\u2013 You won\u2019t spam people.<br>\n\u2013 You won\u2019t compete with Canva for advertising clicks to promote your Canva profile.<br>\nIf we think you\u2019re violating this Agreement, we may freeze your account until we figure it all out.</p>\n<p>Canva Print lets you print the awesome designs that you have created on Canva and you can get them delivered to you directly.\nBasically, if you can\u2019t upload or publish something on Canva, you can\u2019t print it using Canva Print.\nCanva Print may not be available in your country and since we work with third parties, delivery times are estimates only.</p>\n</blockquote> 5.\nUser Content License Grant\n<p>By publishing any designs or content containing User Content using&nbsp;the Service, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant to Canva a multi-use, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content

the Service and Canva\u2019s (and its successors\u2019 and affiliates\u2019) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, User Content does not include Stock Media.\nStock Media is licensed to Canva in accordance with the terms of the&nbsp;Contributor Agreement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you publish Community Content, User Content or designs with User Content, you\u2019re granting us the rights necessary to host them in public view.\nThese rights are only required when you publish User Content on the platform, not for designs that you only download and publish elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote> 6.\nOur Proprietary

Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of Canva and its licensors (including other Users who post User Content or contribute Stock Media (as defined below) to the Service).\nExcept as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any Canva Content.\nUse of the Canva Content for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Except for the User Content you provide to Canva, all materials on the Service are exclusively owned by us or our licensors.\nDon\u2019t steal any of the content that\u2019s helping you make fantastic designs.</p>\n</blockquote> 7.\nStock Media Licenses\n7.1 General.\n<p>The Service provides certain

proprietary rights.\n<strong>All claims must be brought in the parties\u2019 individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims.\nYou agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Canva are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have any disagreements, contact us first.\nWe\u2019re decent people, but if we can\u2019t work it out, then you

advertisers to track whether you have clicked on the adverts they have placed and to measure success.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Log files.</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service.\nWhen you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information.\nThese server logs include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device identifiers.</strong> Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structure stored on or associated with your mobile device which allow us to uniquely identify your mobile device (including mobile phones, smartphones and tablets).\nA device identifier is either data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device\u2019s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Canva.\nA device identifier conveys information to us about how you browse and use our Service and will remain persistently on your device.\nThis will help you log-in faster and can be used by us to analyse device related issues related to our service.\nDevice identifiers used by Canva include the Android Advertising ID and iOS Advertising Identifier.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ad identifiers and other similar technologies.</strong> Our advertising partners use device identifiers and other similar technologies to show you ads that are useful to you.\nWe may share certain information such as your location, browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver personalized advertisements (\u201cads\u201d) that may be of interest to you.\nCanva may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve personalized advertisements either on the Service or on third party websites, including Facebook and Google.\nThese third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, these personalized ads and ad links, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so.\nThey may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser\u2019s or device\u2019s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content.\nCanva does not sell, rent, or share the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties\u2019 own marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Please note that an advertiser may ask Canva to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests).\nIn that situation, Canva determines the target audience and Canva serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser.\nIf you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</p>\n<p>The Canva Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.\nPlease consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote> 2.\nCategories of cookies\n<p>Cookies do many different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience.\nCookies can tell us, for example, whether you have visited the Website before or whether you are a new visitor.\nThey can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just like you can get choc-chip, ginger and peanut butter cookies, you can get different types of online cookies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are different categories of cookies, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>First-party cookies</strong>\n<br>\nFirst party cookies, which are served directly by us to your computer or device.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-party Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nThird-party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cookies can remain on your device for different periods of time.\nSome cookies are \u2018session cookies\u2019, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open.\nThese are deleted automatically once you close your browser.\nOther cookies are \u2018permanent cookies\u2019, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed.\nThey can be used by the Website to recognise your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n</blockquote> 3.\nWhat types of cookies do we use and how do we use them?\n<p>The types of cookies and similar technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the Website can be classified into one of five categories, namely \u2018essential cookies\u2019, \u2018functionality cookies\u2019, \u2018analytics and performance cookies\u2019, \u2018advertising cookies\u2019, and \u2018 social media cookies\u2019.\nWe have set out some further information about each category, and the purposes of the cookies we and third parties use in the following table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<b>Type of cookie</b>\n<b>What it does</b>\n<strong>Cookies necessary for essential purposes</strong>\nThese cookies are essential to provide you with the Website and any services available and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.\nWithout these cookies, services you have asked for, like transactional pages and secure login accounts would not be possible.\n<strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>\nFunctionality cookies record information about choices you have made and allow us to tailor the Website to you.\nThese cookies mean that when you continue to use or come back to the Website, we can provide you with our services as you have asked for them to be provided.<p>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remember settings you have applied, such as layout, text size, preferences, and colors;</li>\n<li>Show you when you are logged in.\nand</li>\n<li>Store accessibility options.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Performance Cookies</strong>\nWe use performance/analytics cookies to measure traffic and usage data and to analyze how the Website is accessed, used, or is performing in order to provide you with a better user experience and to maintain, operate and continually improve the Website.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We use Google Analytics, which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with the Website.\nLike many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions, as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our site.\nThis information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our service.\nThe reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors.\nFor more information on Google Analytics, see here.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site \u2013 for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, visit this Google page: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>\n<p>These cookies allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better understand our Website visitors so that we can improve how we present our content;</li>\n<li>Test different design ideas for particular pages, such as our homepage;</li>\n<li>Collect information about Website visitors such as where they are located and what browsers they are using;</li>\n<li>Determine the number of users of the Website;</li>\n<li>Improve the Website by measuring any errors that occur.\nand</li>\n<li>Conduct research and diagnostics to improve product offerings.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Advertising and Targeting Cookies</strong>\nWe allow third party companies, including advertising companies, to place cookies on our Website.<p>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies enable such companies to distinguish and track your activity across various sites so that they can display ads which are relevant to you and record your activities so they can show ads that they consider relevant to you as you browse the Internet.</p>\n<p>Cookies also allow us and third parties to know whether you have seen an ad or a type of ad, and how long it has been since you\u2019ve last seen it.\nThis information is used for frequency capping purposes, to help tailor the ads you see, and to measure the effectiveness of ads.</p>\n<p>We can use information from one device to help personalize your experience on another device.</p>\n<strong>Social Media Cookies</strong>\nOn some pages of our Website, third parties that provide applications through our Website will set their own cookies in order to track the success of their applications or customize applications for you.\nBecause of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us.<p>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies are used when you share an article using a social media sharing button on our Website (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn) as the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.\nIf you are logged in to your account with the third party, the third party will be able to link information about you with your actions via cookies.</p>\n<p>In addition to the cookies we use on this website, we use technologies such as pixel tags in some emails and push notifications which enable us to understand whether you have opened the email and how you have interacted with it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clever little cookies can do lots of different jobs.</p>\n</blockquote> 4.\nHow to control or delete cookies and similar technologies\n<p>We use cookies on this site to make sure you can use the Website easily and enjoy the Website.\nSome of these cookies are essential and we cannot provide our service without them, but there are others that can be turned off (depending on the device you use).\nNote that, depending on the type of device you have, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms.\nIn addition, we note that disabling cookies and/or similar technologies prevents Canva or its business partners from tracking your browser\u2019s activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted advertising activities by Canva, including via third party websites.\nIt also disables many of the features available through the Service.</p>\n<p>You can change your preferences by changing the settings in your browser.\nYour browser will allow you to:<br>\nSee what cookies or other similar technologies have been dropped on your device;<br>\nBlock cookies or similar technologies;<br>\nClear cookies or similar technologies from your browser.<br>\nDeleting cookies or similar technologies means that any preference settings you have made on a particular website will be lost and the functionality of our Website will be impaired.\nWe cannot guarantee that your experience on our Website will be as good as it could otherwise be.</p>\n<p>If you want to change your settings at any time (for example, if you accept all cookies, but later decide you do not want a certain type of cookie) you\u2019ll need to use your browser settings to remove any third party cookies or similar technologies dropped on your previous visit.</p>\n<p>For more information on how to manage the most popular browsers, please see
