&amp.\nConditions</li>\n<li>API Terms</li>\n</ul>Terms &amp.\nConditions1.\nIntroduction\n<p>Unsplash is a photo discovery platform for free to use, high-definition photos.\nWe (Unsplash Inc., a Canadian corporation) operate the Unsplash website at unsplash.com (the \u201c<strong>Site</strong>\u201d) and all related websites, software, mobile apps, and other services that we provide (together, the \u201c<strong>Service</strong>\u201d) with the goal of celebrating and enabling contributors and fostering creativity in our community.\nYour use of the Service, and our provision of the Service to you, constitutes an agreement by you and Unsplash to be bound by the terms and conditions in these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY.\nBY REGISTERING FOR OR OTHERWISE USING THE SERVICE, YOU ARE TELLING US THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, INCLUDING OUR PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THESE \u201c<strong>TERMS</strong>\u201d).\nIf you don\u2019t agree with anything we propose in these Terms, please don\u2019t (and you don\u2019t have our permission to) use any part of the Service.</p>\n<p>THIS PART IS REALLY IMPORTANT: These Terms require that if we get into a dispute with you relating to the Service (or vice versa), unless you live in the United Kingdom or the European Union, the dispute will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION.\nThis means that YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO SUE US (OR BE SUED BY US) UNDER THIS CONTRACT (except for some disputes that can be taken to small claims court).\nOur disputes will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT A JUDGE OR JURY and you cannot start or join a class action lawsuit.\nHave a very careful read through Section 18 for the actual details regarding our agreement to arbitrate, which we\u2019ve tried to make fair to our users.</p>\n2.\nEligibility\n<p>The Service is designed for use by people who are at least 13 years old.\nIf you are not yet 13, then you can\u2019t use the Service.\nIf you are 13 or older, you promise to us that you have never been suspended from the Service, and promise that your use of the Service won\u2019t break any laws or regulations.\nIf you are using the Service on behalf of a company, organization, or other kind of entity, you represent to us that you have authority to bind the organization to these Terms on its behalf.</p>\n3.\nAccounts and Registration\n<p>When you use the Service, you have the opportunity to register an account.\nWe suggest you do register an account, because creating an account on the Service gives you access to special features around discovery, downloading, and contributing to the community.\nIf you do, we ask that you give us some information about yourself as part of the registration process, some of which is required in order to register the account.\nYou promise that all the information you provide is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date in the future.\nWe also ask you to provide a password to protect the security of your account.\nYou are responsible for keeping your password safe and confidential.\nAny activity that happens under your account will be your responsibility.\nIf ever you think that your account may no longer be secure, you need to notify us immediately at support@unsplash.com.\nYou can also reset your password via https://unsplash.com/users/password/new.</p>\n4.\nLimited License to Use the Service (but not the Photos)\n<p>Conditioned on your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you permission to access the Service only for your personal use.</p>\n5.\nLicense to Photos\n<p>One of the best features of the Service permits you to search, view, and download photographs that have been uploaded by Unsplash users (\u201c<strong>Photos</strong>\u201d).\nYou may download and use Photos from the Service in accordance with, and subject to, the Unsplash License.\nWe encourage you to familiarize yourself with the Unsplash License, as well as the accompanying FAQs.\nTo be sure you don\u2019t miss it, here\u2019s the crux of the license:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unsplash grants you an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide copyright license to download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, and use photos from Unsplash for free, including for commercial purposes, without permission from or attributing the photographer or Unsplash, but this license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that Photos on the Service come with a very, very broad copyright license under the Unsplash License.\nThis is why we say that they are \u201cFree to Use.\u201d Note that the Unsplash License does not include the right to use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Trademarks, logos, or brands that appear in Photos</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People\u2019s images if they are recognizable in the Photos</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Works of art or authorship that appear in Photos</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you download photos with any of these depicted in them, you may need the permission of the brand owner of the brand or work of authorship or individual depending on how you use the Photo.\nPlease see our FAQs for more information and, if you still aren\u2019t sure, you should probably talk to a lawyer who knows about these things.</p>\n6.\nUser Content\n<p>YOU OWN ALL OF YOUR USER CONTENT, INCLUDING ANY PHOTOS THAT YOU UPLOAD TO THE SITE.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>At a High Level</strong>.\nThe Service lets you upload and post your Photos, as well as written text, images, web links, location information, and other content (\u201c<strong>User Content</strong>\u201d).\nAny User Content that you make available on the Service will belong to you or your licensors.\nWe will not claim any ownership in your User Content\u2013it is completely, 100%, yours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Limited License to Us</strong>.\nYou grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, adapt, perform, reproduce, modify, translate, and distribute your User Content (in whole or in part) in any media formats and through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed).\nYou understand that we will not pay you for any use of your Photos and that your Photos will be made available to the public for their use without providing you attribution or compensation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Authority</strong>.\nWhen you upload Photos to the Service, in addition to the license that you grant us to post the Photos publicly and permit other Unsplash users to download and use them, you also authorize us under your copyrights to enforce any violations of the sublicenses we grant in the Photos to others.\nIn other words, if an Unsplash user misuses one of your Photos downloaded from the Service, you authorize us to enforce your copyrights in the Photos on your behalf.\nIf you are interested in learning more about this, please see our FAQs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Representations and Warranties</strong>.\nYou are solely responsible for your User Content and any consequences that occur because you\u2019ve uploaded or posted

rights in the User Content before you upload or post the User Content to the Service.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclaimer</strong>.\nThere is no reasonable way for us to monitor all of the User Content that gets uploaded to or posted on the Service, and we are under no obligation to you or the other users to monitor, edit, or control the User Content that you and other users upload or post to the Service.\nThis means that we are not responsible for any User Content on the Service and you agree not to make any claims against us on account of User Content.\nThat said, we may at any time remove, edit, screen, or block any User Content from the Service (without notifying you first) for any reason, including if we think the User Content violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable.\nWhen you use the Service, you will be exposed to the User Content of other users, some of which may be offensive, inaccurate, or indecent.\nWe may investigate claims alleging that User Content violates these Terms and, in those cases, we alone will decide what actions to take (if any) regarding the User Content in question.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n7.\nDigital Millenium Copyright Act\n<p>We comply with the parts of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that are applicable to internet service providers (17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7512, as amended).\nIf you think that materials uploaded to

Arbitration\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Residents of Canada</strong>.\nIf you are a resident of Canada, this Section 18.a applies to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>General</em>.\nThese Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec, Canada, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nSubject to the rest of this Section 18.a, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action in relation to this Agreement will be the District of Montreal and each of us waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in these courts.\nexcept that, in the event of the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our intellectual property rights, we may pursue legal proceedings in any jurisdiction of our choosing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration</em>.\nEach of us agrees that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Service will be settled exclusively by binding arbitration, except that each of us retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of intellectual property rights.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff in any purported class action or representative proceeding.\nUnless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrators may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this Section 18.a.ii is held unenforceable, then the entirety of Section 18.a will be deemed void.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Rules</em>.\nThe arbitration will be subject to article 940 and following of the Code of civil Procedure (Quebec).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Location</em>.\nUnless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in Montreal, Quebec.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Decision</em>.\nThe arbitrators will render an award within the time frame specified in the Code of Civil Procedure (Quebec).\nThe decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrators based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction to do so.\nAny damages granted by the arbitrators must be consistent with the terms of Section 16 as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Fees</em>.\nThe arbitrators will determine who is responsible to pay the fees associated with the arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Residents of the US and Other Countries</strong>.\nIf you are a resident of the United States, or any other country outside of Canada, the United Kingdom, or the European Union, this Section 18.b applies to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Generally</em>.\nIn the interest in resolving disputes between you and us in the most efficient and cost effective way, you and we agree to resolve any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms or your use of the Service by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nIt uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for limited discovery (i.e., pre-trial fact finding) than in court, and usually is not appealable in court.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, includes all claims, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND UNSPLASH ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Exceptions</em>.\nNotwithstanding Section 18.b.i, we both agree that nothing in these Terms waives or limits either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through federal, state, or local agencies, (iii) seek injunctive relief or other provisional relief in aid arbitration from a court of law, or (iv) to file a lawsuit in a court of law to address intellectual property claims.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitrator</em>.\nAny arbitration between us will be held under the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.\nIf you would like a copy of the AAA Rules, they are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Notice and Process</em>.\nIf one of us intends to seek an arbitration, then they must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or, if we don\u2019t have a physical address on file for you, by email (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d).\nOur address for Notice is: Unsplash, Inc., 500\u2014400 rue McGill, Montr\u00e9al, Que, H2Y 2G1, Canada.\nAny Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (b) describe the specific relief requested (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nYou and we agree to use good faith efforts to resolve any claim directly, but if we don\u2019t reach a resolution within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may start arbitration proceedings.\nDuring the arbitration proceeding, the amount of any settlement offers by you or us will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award (if any).\nIf our dispute is resolved through arbitration in your favor, we will pay you the greater of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator (if any), (ii) the last written settlement offered by us to settle the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award, and (iii) $10,000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Fees</em>.\nIf you commence arbitration under these Terms, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee if your claim is for $10,000 or less.\nOtherwise, the payment of filing fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you can choose whether the arbitration is conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, (ii) via telephone, with no in-person hearings, or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf your claim is for more than $10,000, the arbitration hearings will take place at a location that we agree upon in Los Angeles County, California.\nIf the arbitrator rules that the substance of your claim or the relief you seek in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and you agree to reimburse us for any amounts we previously paid but for which you are obligated to pay under the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award (if any) are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes regarding the payment of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made
