can charge your credit/debit card for shipping costs.</strong>\nYour card will be charged whenever you send a package with Helena Express.\nWe might combine multiple\nshipments into one charge.\nBy dropping off or giving us a package you agree to pay what we charge.\nHere\u2019s something our payment provider says we should say: You authorize Helena Express to send instructions to the financial\ninstitution that issued your card to take payments from your card account in accordance with the\nterms of this agreement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You\u2019ll pay the shipping price plus a small fee.</strong>\nWe usually charge the retail rate for shipping.\nThis means you get the same pricing as if you\nbrought your package to the post office or UPS/FedEx location.\nSometimes (such as if there\u2019s no retail pricing for a shipping option) we adjust rates so we can make money.\nYou can check our current rates with our rate calculator tool.\nWe also charge a fee, typically $5 or less.\nThe fee could be slightly higher if you\u2019re sending something that takes extra work for us,\nlike a giant pile of letters or a package that requires unusual handling.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We can store information about you.</strong>\nTo provide you with quality service, and to protect us and you from legal and liability issues,\nwe save information you provide us.\nThis may include your name, phone number, email, street address,\nIP address, and ZIP code.\nIt also includes information about packages you ship with us, including\nthe to and from addresses, tracking number, and tracking history.\nYour card info is stored as well,\nbut we don\u2019t have access to your full card number or security code.\nSome of the information listed\nis stored with our postage and payment providers.\nthe rest of it is stored on our server here in Helena.\nOur privacy policy is part of these terms, and can be found at helena.express/privacy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You won\u2019t hold us responsible for shipping delays, lost packages, or other issues.</strong>\nWe try to handle your packages as quickly as possible.\nWe usually only have in our custody them for an hour or less.\nThis means that if your package is stolen, delayed, lost, damaged, confiscated, burned, or smited from Above,\nit\u2019s not our fault.\nWe can work with you and the carrier to figure out what happened and take additional steps\nlike filing an insurance claim, but if you file a chargeback, threaten to sue us, or do something else that\u2019s not nice,\nyou will no longer be able to do business with us.\nYou also agree that if something happens while you\u2019re using\na drop box on private property (for example, you slip and fall, crash your car, get robbed, etc), you\nwon\u2019t hold the property owner liable for anything either.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FYI: When we say \u201cpackage\u201d or \u201cshipment\u201d, we mean any item you send, regardless of size, shape, carrier, or service.</p>
