also explains the rights available to you in respect of your personal data.\nIf you or your organization subscribe to any one of Cyren\u2019s Services pursuant to a subscription or other agreement with Cyren, the terms of that agreement may contain different or additional privacy-related terms.\nThis Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the most current versions of our Website Terms of Use

notice on the Websites prior to the change becoming effective.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>\nPrivacy Shield\n<p>Cyren complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, retention of personal data transferred from European Union member countries to the United States.\nCyren has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about Privacy Shield, and to view Cyren\u2019s certification, please visit http://www.privacyshield.gov/US-Business.&nbsp;For purposes of clarification, Privacy Shield only pertains to the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred to Cyren, Inc.</p>\n<p>It is important to note, however, that Cyren\u2019s Websites and Services may be operated via servers situated in the United States and elsewhere.\nIf you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information which you supply to Cyren (including, without limitation, personal information (e.g., your name, phone

protection of your personal information, according to the applicable privacy legislation, the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield and this Privacy Policy, during the course of any onward transfers.</p>\nInformation We Collect and How We Use It\nLegal basis for processing personal data\n<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using personal data will depend on the personal data in question and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>\n<p>We will generally collect personal data from you only in order to perform a contract with you.\nWe may collect and process your personal data if it is in our legitimate interests to do so, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data.\nIf we process your personal data in connection with our (or third parties\u2019) legitimate interests other than as described in this Privacy Policy, we will disclose to you such legitimate reasons.</p>\n<p>Where the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no legal basis for such processing, we will generally obtain your consent.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need the personal data to protect your vital interests or those of third parties.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE -&nbsp.\nCyren will not sell, rent, loan or otherwise share any of the personal data that we collect from you with third parties for commercial gain without your express prior consent.\nMoreover, if in the future we decide to change our policies and carry out any of the foregoing, we will be sure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing such activities (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act, the General Data Protection Regulations, etc.).\nAt that point, you will have the right to request that your personal information not be sold, rented or loaned to third parties.</p>\nInformation You Provide to Us\n<p>When you use our Websites or Services, or you otherwise communicate with us, we may ask you to provide certain personal data voluntarily, including but not limited to your name or company name, company position, postal address, phone numbers, email address, etc.</p>\n<p>Although you may generally use our Websites without providing us with any personal information, there are certain applications and features available on our Websites which you may desire to use and gain access to and which will require you to voluntarily share with us your personal information.\nSuch applications and features may include (but are not limited to): (i) registering to receive marketing materials, white papers and newsletters.\n(ii) registering to participate in online web seminars or other sponsored events.\n(iii) using interactive features or online tools.\n(iv) entering into trials for use of our Services, and/or (v) submitting enquiries to us.\nWe use this personal information to create and administer your account, send you the requested marketing materials and/or regular marketing communications (subject to applicable consent requirements), provide you with the products and services you request and/or to respond to your enquiries.</p>\n<p>The information you submit to Cyren\u2019s Websites is stored in one or more databases which enable you to return without re-registering as well as for sales and marketing purposes.\nYour \u201clogged-in\u201d status may be saved in your browser via a cookie (please see below for further explanations).\nEither way, the personal information that you submit will be saved by Cyren in order to enable your use of such features.</p>\n<p>We also receive certain human resources information from our employees worldwide for the purpose of managing the employment relationship.\nWe handle this information in accordance with our internal corporate policies which are consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nInformation we receive from potential candidates (such as CVs) will be used to assess such candidate\u2019s application and may be kept by us (unless requested otherwise by a candidate).</p>\nInformation We Collect through Automatic Tracking Technologies\n<p>When you use our Websites or Services, we may collect certain data automatically from your computers or devices.\nThe information we collect automatically may include your IP address, device type, operating system details, unique device identification numbers, browser type, browser language and other technical information.\nWe may also collect data about how your device has interacted with our Websites or Services including data about the pages you view and the links you click.</p>\n<p>Like many websites, Cyren uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, and web beacons.\n\u201cCookies\u201d are small data files that are written to and stored on your hard drive when you visit a website.\nthey do not read files on your hard drive.</p>\n<p>We use data and information received from our cookies to improve and customize a user\u2019s experience of our Websites and Services (for example, we may provide features or advertisements that match your interests and preferences).\nWe also use such data for marketing research purposes, to improve the Website\u2019s content and structure, to potentially revise or restructure our sites for easier and more intuitive movement throughout.\nWe may also use the information to evaluate our Website\u2019s technical capacity in order to improve it.</p>\n<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser's toolbar.\nOur Websites allow the user to be notified upon the proposed installation of cookies and the user can then disable the cookies.\nIf you disable cookies, you may continue to use our Website, however, some features may not be available (such as offers regarding Services).</p>\n<p>Currently, the data and information we collect with cookies is reviewed in an aggregated form, which is not personally identifiable.\nWe may also correlate the data and information received from cookies with personally identifiable information, to identify specific users and track their website usage.\nIn such a case, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>For more details about the used cookies, please visit our Cookie Policy</p>\n<p>We and our service providers may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.\nWeb Beacons/Web Bugs/Pixel Tags), that help better manage content on our site by informing us and our service providers what content is effective.\nClear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nWe and our service providers tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>When corresponding with you via HTML capable e-mail (for example by sending you marketing emails), we may use \"format sensing\" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our e-mail.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.\nIf you would like to opt-out and unsubscribe to these emails, please see \u201cChoice and Opt-out\u201d.</p>\nInformation collected through our Services\n<p>We use information that we collect from our Services mainly to provide you with access to the Services and to operate and maintain the Services for your personal usage.\nWe use the information in order to monitor the performance and effectiveness of the Services, monitor compliance with our terms and conditions and enable compatibility with third party operating systems/products/services.\nWe may also use such information in order to further improve and expand our Services, determine product/service/feature lifecycles, conduct spam and threat research, address troubleshooting issues, generate statistics and trend analysis.</p>\n<p>Cyren also come into contact with end user personal data when such data is collected and received by Cyren\u2019s enterprise clients and then made available to us through our products and services.\nIn some cases Cyren may simply be processing this data on behalf of its customers, and in other cases we may need to interact with such data in order to provide management and support in connection with such products and services.\nWhen Cyren receives end user data in this capacity (i.e., as a data processor), Cyren will carry out the instructions of its clients (i.e., the data controllers) in regards to its usage and processing of such data, and will not use such data outside the scope of its processing activities unless required by applicable law.</p>\nInformation from Other Sources\n<p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, including service providers and third-party services.\nWe may allow our service providers to place cookies on our Websites to permit advertising to be directed to you on other websites, applications or services, to monitor website performance and to provide capabilities to retain requested investor relations documents.</p>\n<p>We may combine the information we receive from our service providers with information we have collected about you.\nTo the extent we combine such third party sourced information with personal information we have collected about you on the Services, we will treat the combined information as personal information under this Privacy Policy.\nWe are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by third parties or third-party policies or practices.</p>\nOther Ways We Use Your Information\n<p>As noted above, we generally use the information collected

support, administrative or security reasons;</li>\n<li>To analyze and provide statistical information to third parties.\nThis information will not identify you personally;</li>\n<li>to investigate and prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to our Services and Websites, and other illegal activities;</li>\n<li>For any other purpose specified in this Privacy Policy and/or in our Terms of Use.</li>\n</ul> Choice and Opt-Out\n<p>Even if you have agreed to receive marketing and operational communications from Cyren, you may always decide to stop receiving such materials by sending an email to unsubscribe@cyren.com or by visiting the following webpage: https://pages.cyren.com/unsubscribe.html.\nAll marketing-related emails sent by Cyren include the option to unsubscribe.</p>\nYour Right to Review, Modify or Delete Data\n<p>You have the right to request that Cyren provides you with a description of its data collection and sales practices insofar as your personal information is concerned, which may include a description of the categories of personal information that Cyren has collected, the source for such personal information, the personal information, if any, that Cyren

efforts to accommodate your requests, in some circumstances we may not agree.\nIf that should happen, Cyren expressly reserves the right to refuse your request to change the personal information in Cyren\u2019s records, and will instead append an alternative text to the record in question.</p>\n<p>Before Cyren is able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies or otherwise delete the personal information in our possession, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request.\nPlease note that you may not be able to benefit from all features of the Websites if you request the deletion of your personal information or object to or withdraw your consent to such processing.\nIn addition, where Cyren processes data in connection with the Services, an individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct their query to the applicable Cyren customer (the data controller) who purchased the Services.</p>\n<p>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.\nFor more information, please contact your

agreements.\nEven if you cease your use of the Services and request that we delete your personal information, we may retain certain information in order to meet our obligations.</p>\nDisclosure of

regulatory agencies, or (v) protect the property, interests, or personal safety of our agents, employees, customers or the public.\nUnder such circumstances, we may be prohibited by law, court order or other legal process from providing notice of the disclosure, and we reserve the right to not provide such notice in our sole discretion;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Cyren organizes the operation of the Services within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity, or if Cyren is acquired by, or merged with another entity, provided however, that those entities agree to be bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cyren may share personal information and information related to your use of the Websites, with companies or organizations connected to or

that their use of such information must comply with applicable privacy requirements.\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cyren is also entitled to transfer or share anonymous, statistic or aggregative

facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which Cyren has operations.\nPlease note that these data transfer practices may vary based on customer location and the applicable Service being used.</p>\n<p>We have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data will remain protected in

personal data processed from the European Economic Area in accordance with European Union data protection laws.\nOur Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request.\nWe have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners.</p>\nLinks to Third-Party Web Sites\n<p>Through our Websites, you may connect to third party websites via

protecting children's privacy online, generally, please view the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html.</p>\nOur Commitment to Data Security\n<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have applied reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.\nWe also limit access to personal data and confidential information on our systems to only those employees with a specific need to access this information.\nHowever, due to technological limitations and the risk of unlawful interceptions and accessing of transmissions and/or data, we cannot completely assure you, and you should not expect, that your personal information, and any other electronically communicated information, will be absolutely confidential.</p>\n<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.\nWhen you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>\n<p>Please remember that you play a
