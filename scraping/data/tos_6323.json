October 7, 2020</p>This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Application to achieve the purposes described below.\nSuch technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with this Application.\nFor simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate.For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker.\nFor this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\nSome of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent.\nWhenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.\nThis Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers).\nUnless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider.\nSome of them expire upon termination of the User\u2019s browsing session.In addition to what\u2019s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information \u2013 such as the presence of other Trackers - in the linked privacy policies of the respective third-party providers or by contacting the Owner.\nTo find more information

where relevant: Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.\nAdditionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.\nIt is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User\u2019s initial consent.\nOther Trackers in the browser\u2019s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.\nWith regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.Locating Tracker SettingsUsers can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings, such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings, view and look for the relevant setting).Advertising industry specific opt-outsNotwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided byYourOnlineChoices (EU), theNetwork Advertising Initiative (US) and theDigital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.\nSuch initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.\nThe Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application calledAppChoices that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.Owner and Data ControllerCinnamon Technologies Inc., 8 The Green STE 4000 Dover, DE 19901 United States <strong>Owner contact email:</strong>

make any public statements or disclosures (including via online media) regarding these Terms, the transactions contemplated by these Terms or consummated hereunder, or about the relationship of the parties without the prior written approval of Coil and Cinnamon.\nSome of the payments we collect from Users for Subscriptions will be disbursed to third parties, as further detailed in our FAQs.\nAny

the gross amount owed to you, and will pay the full amount withheld over to the competent tax authorities.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OTHER LEGAL TERMS</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intellectual Property

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS.\nIT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Binding Arbitration</strong>\n<em>.</em>\n</p>\n<p>The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\n&nbsp;If you and Cinnamon are unable to resolve a dispute through informal negotiations, You and Cinnamon agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms through final and binding arbitration, except to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Cinnamon\u2019s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights), or except those disputes expressly excluded below.\nUnder such circumstances Cinnamon may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Cinnamon Service, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) or to address other exigent circumstances without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described herein.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Rules</strong>.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.\nArbitration shall be initiated through JAMS.\nAny dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator.\nIf there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in this Terms will govern.\nThe JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at&nbsp;https://jamsadr.com&nbsp;or 1-800-352-5267.\nThe determination of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the JAMS Rules.\nEach party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and, in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys\u2019 fees) less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person in the United States in San Francisco, California, by provisions through the submission of documents, by phone or online.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Cinnamon, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Agreement.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Cinnamon.\nUnless otherwise required by law, you and Cinnamon will each pay your own attorneys\u2019 fees.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and the Company may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Waiver of Class Actions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE AN ACTION ON A CLASS-WIDE BASIS AGAINST US.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES BROUGHT BY USER WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.\nCLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED.\nIf, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Company is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and Cinnamon in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND CINNAMON WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND HAVE EITHER DONE SO OR KNOWINGLY ELECTED NOT TO DO SO.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Parties, Legal Notices, Governing Law and
