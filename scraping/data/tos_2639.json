Transfermate Nominated Account at the time at which the Contract is agreed, and it is Your obligation to ensure You use the correct Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<br>\n<li>

customer.</li>\n<li>7.2.2.\nIn certain regions (as may be notified to You at the time of placing the Order) it is an option for You to make the Lodgement by way of DD/ACH payment, however We are under no obligation to provide You with this option and require that You make at least one transfer by the means set out at Clause 7.1.</li>\n<li>7.2.3.\nIt is imperative that You ensure that all details supplied by You on the direct debit mandate agreements or ACH equivalent (the \u201cMandate\u201d) are correct and valid, and that only authorised signatories on the Your Funding Account have signed this Mandate, and confirm You shall indemnify Us for any losses incurred by Us as a result of errors made by You on the mandate.</li>\n<li>7.2.4.\nYou are obliged to ensure that (1) there are sufficient funds in Your Funding Account to meet the direct debit payment and (2) sufficient funds remain in Your Funding Account until the direct debit has cleared and settled in to the TransferMate

transfer to Us so that the Lodgement is not delayed.\nTransfermate shall never facilitate a shortfall from You, nor do we offer any credit facility where You are delayed in completing a Lodgement.</li>\n<li>7.2.5.\nWe reserve the right to revoke the option of making Lodgements by DD/ACH payments where any DD/ACH payment made by You is reversed from the Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>\n<li>7.2.6.\nWe reserve the right to limit the amount of funds to be taken by Mandate.</li>\n<li>7.2.7.\nIf a DD Mandate is inactive for a period of 9 months or more, We reserve the right to deactivate the option to pay by DD/ACH without prior notice to You or to request You to update the Mandate.</li>\n<li>7.2.8.\nIn order to cancel a Mandate, You must contact Your bank to cancel.\nTransfermate cannot do this on Your behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<li>7.3.\nOther than by availing of the means set out at Clauses 7.1 and 7.2, no other means is available for funding the Transfermate Nominated Account.\nSpecifically We do not accept cash, cheques or any equivalent.\nAny attempts by You to make the Lodgement by any such prohibited means shall be invalid under the Contract, causing a delay and potentially a breach of the Contract.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.4.\nUnless otherwise agreed with You, We do not have nor do We request, any access to the Funding Account and shall not unilaterally debit funds from Your Funding Account.\nYou must initiate the Lodgement to the Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.5.\nWe reserve the right to reject funding from sources that We may reasonably believe or suspect may breach the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction, or that would meet the standards in Our Anti-Money Laundering Policy.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.6.You agree and acknowledge that We may refuse to accept or return any payment of money from a third party or from any account of a third party, and that Transfermate does not accept liability or responsibility for any loss, cost or expense incurred or suffered by You in connection with such non-acceptance or return, including because You are subsequently in default of your obligations to Us.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.7.\nIn the event that We have completed the Final Transfer before receiving cleared and settled funds from You, including for example where a DD/ACH payment is reversed, a DD request is cancelled or a payment is disputed , You will be liable to pay Us the amount of the Final Transfer plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.8.\nTransfermate is not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institutions associated with the payment facilities You nominate.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>8.\nReactive

\u201cBiller\u201d) who has requested that We provide You with an option to discharge an invoice (meaning for this purpose an invoice, bill or other contractual debt due to the Biller) by way of the Transaction Service.\nAlternatively, the Collection Email may be issued to You directly by the Biller.\nThis Collection Email typically includes a link to a secure section of the Website (the

Collection Email.</li>\n<br>\n<li>8.4.\nYou may be required to open an Account with Us in accordance with Clause 4 before making the Reactive Payment.\nWe shall make it clear at the time of opening the Account whether the steps You are asked to undertake enable You to make a single Reactive Payment only, in some case without a foreign exchange element, or whether in undertaking the steps, You have effectively opened an Account with Us, enabling You to make full use of the Transaction Service.</li>\n<br>\n<li>8.5.\nThe options available to You as to how You make the Reactive Payment shall vary according to the instructions of the Biller, the applicable currency and Your location.\nWe make no warranty or commitment as to the specific steps required to make a Reactive Payment.\nThese shall be explained on the Portal and/or the Collection Email.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>9.\nCharges, Interest and Exchange rates</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>9.1.\nThe current charges, interest and other fees,

You following prior request, be accepted as evidence of the instructions or communications recorded, and may be used as evidence in any dispute, action, proceedings involving the use by You of the Transaction Service.\nThe absence of a telephone call recording shall not be deemed as detrimental in any such dispute, and in such circumstances, We are entitled to rely on an undisputed Booking

criminal activity.\nIn addition, Transfermate will be obliged to report this suspicious activity and in line with regulations, is prohibited from disclosing this to the client.</p>\n<p>By providing Us with false identification or contact details, We will deem this a misuse of the Transaction Service.\nWe are legally bound to report such misdemeanours to the relevant authorities, and as such, You may be the subject of a criminal investigation.</p>\n<p>Transfermate will NOT do business with anyone suspected of, or directly involved in Money Laundering, or where funds have been sourced by any illegal activity.</p>\n<p>To assist the world wide fight against the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, worldwide laws require Transfermate to obtain, verify and record information

notify the Payer of (i) Your reliance on the Receivables Transaction to discharge an Invoice and (ii) the impact to You of the Payer not making the Lodgement to Us, is likely to impact on the effectiveness of the Receivables Transaction.\nWe do not prescribe the means by which such notification should be made by You.</li>\n<br>\n<li>4.2.\nYou may request that We send Payers the Collection Email on Your behalf and provide them with the Invoice Reference in order that they can discharge invoices to You.\nIn such a scenario, We shall always need You to upload the

circumstances, We may not be able to collect from a country or in a currency notwithstanding what has been set out on the Portal, or We may be prohibited from dealing with a particular Payer as set out in Clause 3.3.5.\nWe hereby reserve Our right to bring this limitation or restriction to Your attention after the Receivables Contract has been entered without incurring any liability on Our part, and as such <u>Our ability to fulfil the Receivables Contract is conditional on Us being able to receive funds from a proposed Payer or from a Payer\u2019s country or denominated in a specific currency</u> from the time the Receivables Contract is entered until the funds from the Payer have been received by Us.</li>\n<br>\n<li>5.3.\nIn some countries there are regulatory or export restrictions on the frequency and value of funds that can be remitted from that country at one time in a single transaction.\nTransfermate continually monitors these restrictions and makes reasonable efforts to notify You prior to entering the Receivables Transaction where the limit may impact on our ability to perform the Contract.\nHowever where We are prevented by such restriction from performing the Contract, We shall have no liability to You for any loss or damage You may incur as a result.\nWe shall notify You of the restriction and offer You the option to cancel the Receivables Transaction or amend the amount being sought.\nIt is always Your obligation to be aware of the applicable laws and restrictions attaching to the remittance of funds from the Payer and the Payer\u2019s

require Us to book an FX rate (for example to enable the Payer pay Us in the Payer\u2019s local currency), then We shall be required to acquire currency in the event that the Payer commits to discharging the Invoice.\n<u>This creates a legal obligation on You to ensure that the Payer makes the Lodgement to conclude the Receivables Transaction</u>, and in the event that there is a failure by the Payer to make the Lodgement in full and by the Settlement Date, this shall be a breach of Your obligations under the Receivables Contract.\nIn such event, We will close out the Order at its then prevailing market rates and <u>any FX loss, costs or other damages incurred by Us (collectively a \u201c<strong>Loss</strong>\u201d) as a result shall be recoverable in full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.2.\nIn certain scenarios, as will be notified to You <u>prior</u> to entering the Contract, We acquire the currency immediately following the entry of the Contract, and in that event, even where the Payer does not make a commitment to Us to discharge the Invoice on the Portal, We may incur a Loss.\nThis Loss shall be recoverable in <u>full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.3.\nThe default means for Payer making a Lodgement are set out on the Portal and may be fixed by You prior to entering the Contract.\nWhere the Payer is limited to making the Lodgement by wire only, then subject to Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 herein, You assume no additional liability.\nHowever in the event that You determine that the Payer may make the Lodgement by way of Direct Debit / ACH or by credit / debit card, then there is a risk that the Payer may recall the funds from Us after we have made the Final Transfer to You, causing a Loss to Us.\nIn such an event You agree to transfer the amount of the Final Transfer on demand from Us.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.4.\nYou confirm that You have obtained whatever Payer consent is required in accordance with the applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws to permit Us to contact the Payers, and in the event that We incur a Loss as a result of Your failure to comply with these applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws, that

no obligation to provide You with this option and require that You make at least one transfer by the means set out at Clause 7.1.</li>\n<li>7.2.3.\nIt is imperative that You ensure that all details supplied by You on the direct debit mandate agreements or ACH equivalent (the \u201cMandate\u201d) are correct and valid, and that only authorised signatories on the Your Funding Account have signed

sufficient funds in Your Funding Account to meet the direct debit payment and (2) sufficient funds remain in Your Funding Account until the direct debit has cleared and settled in to the TransferMate

Lodgement.</li>\n<li>7.2.5.\nWe reserve the right to revoke the option of making Lodgements by DD/ACH payments where any DD/ACH payment made by You is reversed from the Transfermate Nominated

Contract, causing a delay and potentially a breach of the Contract.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.4.\nUnless otherwise agreed with You, We do not have nor do We request, any access to the Funding Account and

have effectively opened an Account with Us, enabling You to make full use of the Transaction Service.</li>\n<br>\n<li>8.5.\nThe options available to You as to how You make the Reactive Payment shall

circumstances, We may not be able to collect from a country or in a currency notwithstanding what has been set out on the Portal, or We may be prohibited from dealing with a particular Payer as set out in Clause 3.3.5.\nWe hereby reserve Our right to bring this limitation or restriction to Your attention after the Receivables Contract has been entered without incurring any liability on Our part, and as such <u>Our ability to fulfil the Receivables Contract is conditional on Us being able to receive funds from a proposed Payer or from a Payer\u2019s country or denominated in a specific currency</u> from the time the Receivables Contract is entered until the funds from the Payer have been received by Us.</li>\n<br>\n<li>5.3.\nIn some countries there are regulatory or export restrictions on the frequency and value of funds that can be remitted from that country at one time in a single transaction.\nTransfermate continually monitors these restrictions and makes reasonable

discharging the Invoice.\n<u>This creates a legal obligation on You to ensure that the Payer makes the Lodgement to conclude the Receivables Transaction</u>, and in the event that there is a failure by the Payer to make the Lodgement in full and by the Settlement Date, this shall be a breach of Your obligations under the Receivables Contract.\nIn such event, We will close out the Order at its then prevailing market rates and <u>any FX loss, costs or other damages incurred by Us (collectively a \u201c<strong>Loss</strong>\u201d) as a result shall be recoverable in full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.2.\nIn certain scenarios, as will be notified to You <u>prior</u> to entering the Contract, We acquire the currency immediately following the entry of the Contract, and in that event, even where the Payer does not make a commitment to Us to discharge the Invoice on the Portal, We may incur a Loss.\nThis Loss shall be recoverable in <u>full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.3.\nThe default means for Payer making a Lodgement are set out on the Portal and may be fixed by You prior to entering the Contract.\nWhere the Payer is limited to making the

Direct Debit / ACH or by credit / debit card, then there is a risk that the Payer may recall the funds from Us after we have made the Final Transfer to You, causing a Loss to Us.\nIn such an event You agree to transfer the amount of the Final Transfer on demand from Us.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.4.\nYou confirm that You have obtained whatever Payer consent is required in accordance with the applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws to permit Us to contact the Payers, and in the event that We incur a Loss as a result of Your failure to comply with these applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws, that You shall indemnity Us in full for that Loss.</li>\n<br>\n<li>6.5.\nLate or incomplete settlement of any of the Losses set out herein, shall incur default interest on the total amount due, at a compound rate of 5% per annum above the prime lending rate for the time being in force, calculated daily and payable to Us on the date payment is made.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>7.\nMass Uploads:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>7.1.\nIn addition to uploading single Payment Transactions as set out in Clause 2.1, You have the option to upload a batch of transactions (this capability is known as a \u201c<strong>Mass Upload</strong>\u201d).</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.2.\nOn request from You, We shall provide You with a template setting out the information required by Us to process a Mass Upload.</li>\n<br>\n<li>7.3.\nYou are required to follow this template and produce a statement listing the transaction requests for Mass Upload together with attaching invoice(s) in the following

parties under this Agreement, are cumulative and are without prejudice and in addition to any rights or remedies a party may have whether arising under common law, equity, statute, custom or otherwise.\nNo exercise by a party of any one right or remedy under this Agreement, or under common law, equity, statute, custom or otherwise, will (save to the extent, if any, provided expressly in

de violation effective du pr\u00e9sent contrat par l'autre partie.\n19.11.\nWithout prejudice to any other rights or remedies that both parties may have, both parties acknowledge and agree that

You use the correct Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>7.2.\nBy Direct Debit (\"DD\") or Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\") payments:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>7.2.1.\nThis option is not available to You if You are a Sole Trader or personal customer.</li>\n<li>7.2.2.\nIn certain regions (as may be notified to You at the time of placing the Order) it is an option for You to make the Lodgement by way of DD/ACH payment, however We are under no obligation to provide You with this option and require that You make at least one transfer by the means set out at Clause 7.1.</li>\n<li>7.2.3.\nIt is imperative that You ensure that all details supplied by You on the direct debit mandate agreements or ACH equivalent (the \"<strong>Mandate</strong>\") are correct and valid, and that only authorised signatories on the Your Funding Account have signed this Mandate, and confirm You shall indemnify Us for any losses incurred by Us as a result of errors made by You on the mandate.</li>\n<li>7.2.4.\nYou are obliged to ensure that (1) there are sufficient funds in Your Funding Account to meet the direct debit payment and (2) sufficient funds remain in Your Funding Account until the direct debit has cleared and settled in to the TransferMate Nominated Account.\nIf a Lodgement by way of DD/ACH does not reach Transfermate Nominated Account due to insufficient funds or for any other reason, You must then complete the Lodgement by way of wire transfer to Us so that the Lodgement is not delayed.\nTransfermate shall never facilitate a shortfall from You, nor do we offer any credit facility where You are delayed in completing a Lodgement.</li>\n<li>7.2.5.\nWe reserve the right to revoke the option of making Lodgements by DD/ACH payments where any DD/ACH payment made by You is reversed from the Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>\n<li>7.2.6.\nWe reserve the right to limit the amount of funds to be taken by Mandate.</li>\n<li>7.2.7.\nIf a DD Mandate

no other means is available for funding the Transfermate Nominated Account.\nSpecifically We do not accept cash, cheques or any equivalent.\nAny attempts by You to make the Lodgement by any such prohibited means shall be invalid under the Contract, causing a delay and potentially a breach of the Contract.</li>\n<li>7.4.\nUnless otherwise agreed with You, We do not have nor do We request, any access to the Funding Account and shall not unilaterally debit funds from Your Funding Account.\nYou must initiate the Lodgement to the Transfermate Nominated Account.</li>\n<li>7.5.\nWe reserve the right to reject funding from sources that We may reasonably believe or suspect may breach the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction, or that would meet the standards in Our Anti-Money Laundering Policy.</li>\n<li>7.6.\nYou agree and acknowledge that We may refuse to accept or return any payment of money from a third party or from any account of a third party, and that Transfermate does not accept liability or responsibility for any loss, cost or expense incurred or suffered by You in connection with such non-acceptance or return, including because You are subsequently in default of your obligations to Us.</li>\n<li>7.7.\nIn the event that We have completed the Final Transfer before receiving cleared and settled funds from You, including for example where a DD/ACH payment is reversed, a DD request is cancelled or a payment is disputed , You will be liable to pay Us the amount of the Final Transfer plus interest at the rate of 5% per annum.</li>\n<li>7.8.\nTransfermate is not responsible for any fees or charges that may be imposed by the financial institutions associated with the payment facilities You nominate.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>8.\nReactive

by way of the Transaction Service.\nAlternatively, the Collection Email may be issued to You directly by the Biller.\nThis Collection Email typically includes a link to a secure section of the Website (the <strong>\"Portal\"</strong>) and a request for You from, or on behalf of, the Biller to make a Reactive Payment in order to settle the invoice from the Biller;</li>\n<li>8.2.\nYou are under no obligation to Us to make the Reactive Payment \u2013 this is a matter between You and the Biller.\nHowever should You wish to make the Reactive Payment, it is incumbent on You to ensure that You make it in the currency quoted on the Portal and a failure to do this shall result in the Payment Transaction being rejected, a potential breach of Your obligation to the Biller to discharge the invoice, and Your incurring additional fees and charges if We are required to perform an additional currency exchange.</li>\n<li>8.3.\nIf You are satisfied to make the Reactive Payment, You are required to go to the Portal or take such other steps as specified in the Collection Email and complete the Payment Transaction by strictly adhering to the requirements detailed by Us on the Portal or within the Collection Email.</li>\n<li>8.4.\nYou may be required to open an Account with Us in accordance with Clause 4 before making the Reactive Payment.\nWe shall make it clear at the time of opening the Account whether the steps You are asked to undertake enable You to make a single Reactive Payment only, in some case without a foreign exchange element, or whether in undertaking the steps, You have effectively opened an Account with Us, enabling You to make full use of the Transaction Service.</li>\n<li>8.5.\nThe options available to You as to how You make the Reactive Payment shall vary according to the instructions of the Biller, the applicable currency and Your location.\nWe make no warranty or commitment as to the specific steps required to make a Reactive Payment.\nThese shall be

and (ii) the impact to You of the Payer not making the Lodgement to Us, is likely to impact on the effectiveness of the Receivables Transaction.\nWe do not prescribe the means by which such notification should be made by You.</li>\n<li>4.2.\nYou may request that We send Payers the Collection Email on Your behalf and provide them with the Invoice Reference in order that they can discharge invoices to You.\nIn such a scenario, We shall always need You to upload the Invoice.</li>\n<li>4.3.\nYou have the option of requesting that Your Portal\u2019s URL is attached to the Collection Email,

set out in Clause 3.3.5.\nWe hereby reserve <u>Our right to bring this limitation or restriction to Your attention after the Receivables Contract has been entered without incurring any liability on Our part, and as such Our ability to fulfil the Receivables Contract is conditional on Us being able to receive funds from a proposed Payer or from a Payer\u2019s country or denominated in a specific currency</u> from the time the Receivables Contract is entered until the funds from the Payer have been received by Us.</li>\n<li>5.3.\nIn some countries there are regulatory or export restrictions on the frequency and value of funds that can be remitted from that country at one time in a single transaction.\nTransfermate continually monitors these restrictions and makes reasonable efforts to notify You prior to entering the Receivables Transaction where the limit may impact on our ability to perform the Contract.\nHowever where We are prevented by such restriction from performing the Contract, We shall have no liability to You for any loss or damage You may incur as a result.\nWe shall notify You of the restriction and offer You the option to cancel the Receivables Transaction or

book an FX rate (for example to enable the Payer pay Us in the Payer\u2019s local currency), then We shall be required to acquire currency in the event that the Payer commits to discharging the Invoice.\n<u>This creates a legal obligation on You to ensure that the Payer makes the Lodgement to conclude the Receivables Transaction</u>, and in the event that there is a failure by the Payer to make the Lodgement in full and by the Settlement Date, this shall be a breach of Your obligations under the Receivables Contract.\nIn such event, We will close out the Order at its then prevailing market rates and <u>any FX loss, costs or other damages incurred by Us (collectively a \"Loss\") as a result shall be recoverable in full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<li>6.2.\nIn certain scenarios, as will be notified to You prior to entering the Contract, We acquire the currency immediately following the entry of the Contract, and in that event, even where the Payer does not make a commitment to Us to discharge the Invoice on the Portal, We may incur a Loss.\nThis Loss shall be recoverable in <u>full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<li>6.3.\nThe default means for Payer making a Lodgement are set out on the Portal and may be fixed by You prior to entering the Contract.\nWhere the Payer is limited to making the Lodgement by wire only, then subject to Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 herein, You assume no additional liability.\nHowever in the event that You determine that the Payer may make the Lodgement by way of Direct Debit / ACH or by credit / debit card, then there is a risk that the Payer may recall the funds from Us after we have made the Final Transfer to You, causing a Loss to Us.\nIn such an event You agree to transfer the amount of the Final Transfer on demand from Us.</li>\n<li>6.4.\nYou confirm that You have obtained whatever Payer consent is required in accordance with the applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws to permit Us to contact the Payers, and in the event that We incur a Loss as a result of Your failure to comply with these applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws, that You shall indemnity Us in full for that Loss.</li>\n<li>6.5.\nLate or incomplete settlement of any of the Losses set out herein, shall incur default interest on the total amount due, at a compound rate of 5% per annum above the prime lending rate for the time being in force, calculated daily and payable to Us on the date payment is made.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>7.\nMass Uploads:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>7.1.\nIn addition to uploading single Payment Transactions as set out in Clause 2.1, You have the option to upload a batch of transactions (this capability is known as a \"<strong>Mass Upload</strong>\").</li>\n<li>7.2.\nOn request from You, We shall provide You with a template setting out the information required by Us to process a Mass Upload.</li>\n<li>7.3.\nYou are required to follow this template and produce a statement listing the transaction requests for Mass Upload together with attaching invoice(s) in the following format.\nPDF, DOCX, XLS, subject to file size limitation as detailed on the Portal.\nOur requirements and supported formats may be modified by Us from time to time, and We reserve the right to notify You of any modified requirements during the Mass Upload process.</li>\n<li>7.4.\nWe shall

Payer</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>8.1.\nOn Our receipt of funds from Payer We shall provide You with email confirmation within 1 Business Day that a specific Invoice Reference has been discharged pursuant to a Receivables Transaction.</li>\n<li>8.2.\nUnless You provide Us with any instruction to the contrary with regard to these funds, they will be retained by Us in the Virtual Account, in the currency set on that Virtual Account.\nThe decision to use a Virtual Account instead of nominating a Receivables Account is a matter for You and We cannot advise You on the wisest course of action for Your needs.\nThere are risks associated with the use of a Virtual Account and You are advised to seek independent legal and financial advice should You wish to retain funds in a Virtual Account, in particular if You do not have a specific purpose in mind for the onward use of those funds.</li>\n<li>8.3.\nFollowing a specific request from You We shall transfer the funds into Your Receivables Account.\nYou may make this request while the funds are in the Virtual Account or prior to the Payer making the Lodgement.\nWe shall make this transfer within 1 to 2 Business Days of receiving the

to You as to how You make the Reactive Payment shall vary according to the instructions of the Biller, the applicable currency and Your location.\nWe make no warranty or commitment as to the specific

Clause 6.3</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4.\nEngagement with the Payer</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>4.1.\nFailure by You to notify the Payer of (i) Your reliance on the Receivables Transaction to discharge an Invoice and (ii) the impact to You of the Payer not making the Lodgment to Us, is likely to impact on the effectiveness of the Receivables Transaction.\nWe do not prescribe the means by which such notification should be made by You.</li>\n<li>4.2.\nYou may request that We send Payers the Collection Email on Your behalf and provide them with the Invoice Reference in order that they can discharge invoices to You.\nIn such a scenario, We shall always need You to upload the Invoice.</li>\n<li>4.3.\nYou have the option of requesting that Your Portal\u2019s URL is attached to the Collection Email, by inter-alia adding it to the invoice(s) template from Your accounting software.\nIn addition, You have the option of using Your logo on the Collection Email.\nThese options shall be available to You to select on the Portal, however the options may not be possible on every Collection Email.</li>\n<li>4.4.\nAs part of issuing the Collection Email, We will set out the means by which the Payer can comply with the Receivables Transaction, and any documentation required from the Payer in order to allow the Payer participate in the Receivables Transaction.</li>\n<li>4.5.\nIf the Payer notifies Us that they do not wish to engage in the Receivables Transaction, You shall be updated within 2 Business Days of Our being made aware, and You may be asked to make good any loss caused to Us as a result (as set out in Clause 6).</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>5.\nLimitations on the Receipt of Funds</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>5.1.\nThe Portal is intended to contain a list of the countries into which We are able to send Invoices on Your behalf and also available the currencies.\nWhile We make reasonable efforts to manage this listing, We do not warrant that this listing is current or accurate.</li>\n<li>5.2.\nIn some circumstances, We may not be able to collect from a country or in a currency notwithstanding what has been set out on the Portal, or We may be prohibited from dealing with a particular Payer as set out in Clause 3.3.5.\nWe hereby reserve <u>Our right to bring this limitation or restriction to Your attention after the Receivables Contract has been entered without incurring any liability on Our part, and as such Our ability to fulfil the Receivables Contract is conditional on Us being able to receive funds from a proposed Payer or from a Payer\u2019s country or denominated in a specific currency</u> from the time the Receivables Contract is entered until the funds from the Payer have been received by Us.</li>\n<li>5.3.\nIn some countries there are regulatory or export restrictions on the frequency and value of funds that can be remitted from that country at one time in a single transaction.\nTransfermate continually monitors these restrictions and makes reasonable efforts to notify You prior to entering the Receivables Transaction where the limit may impact on our ability to perform the Contract.\nHowever where We are prevented by such restriction from performing the Contract, We shall have no liability to You for any loss or damage You may incur as a result.\nWe shall notify You of the restriction and offer You the option to cancel the Receivables Transaction or amend the amount being sought.\nIt is always Your obligation to be aware of the applicable laws and restrictions attaching to the remittance of funds from the Payer and the Payer\u2019s country of residence.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6.\nYour Legal Liability as a result of entering a Receivables Contract</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>6.1.\nIf You, as part of entering the Receivables Contract, require Us to book an FX rate (for example to enable the Payer pay Us in the Payer\u2019s local currency), then We shall be required to acquire currency in the event that the Payer commits to discharging the Invoice.\n<u>This creates a legal obligation on You to ensure that the Payer makes the Lodgment to conclude the Receivables Transaction</u>, and in the event that there is a failure by the Payer to make the Lodgment in full and by the Settlement Date, this shall be a breach of Your obligations under the Receivables Contract.\nIn such event, We will close out the Order at its then prevailing market rates and <u>any FX loss, costs or other damages incurred by Us (collectively a \"Loss\") as a result shall be recoverable in full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<li>6.2.\nIn certain scenarios, as will be notified to You prior to entering the Contract, We acquire the currency immediately following the entry of the Contract, and in that event, even where the Payer does not make a commitment to Us to discharge the Invoice on the Portal, We may incur a Loss.\nThis Loss shall be recoverable in <u>full from You on demand by Us</u>.</li>\n<li>6.3.\nThe default means for Payer making a Lodgment are set out on the Portal and may be fixed by You prior to entering the Contract.\nWhere the Payer is limited to making the Lodgment by wire only, then subject to Clauses 6.1, 6.2 and 6.4 herein, You assume no additional liability.\nHowever in the event that You determine that the Payer may make the Lodgment by way of Direct Debit / ACH or by credit / debit card, then there is a risk that the Payer may recall the funds from Us after we have made the Final Transfer to You, causing a Loss to Us.\nIn such an event You agree to transfer the amount of the Final Transfer on demand from Us.</li>\n<li>6.4.\nYou confirm that You have obtained whatever Payer consent is required in accordance with the applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws to permit Us to contact the Payers, and in the event that We incur a Loss as a result of Your failure to comply with these applicable Data Protection and Privacy laws, that You shall indemnity Us in full for that Loss.</li>\n<li>6.5.\nLate or incomplete settlement of any of the Losses set out herein, shall incur default interest on the total amount due, at a compound rate of 5% per annum above the prime lending rate for the time being in force, calculated daily and payable to Us on the date payment is made.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>7.\nMass Uploads:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>7.1.\nIn addition to uploading single Payment Transactions as set out in Clause 2.1, You have the option to upload a batch of transactions (this capability is known as a \"<strong>Mass Upload</strong>\").</li>\n<li>7.2.\nOn request from You, We shall provide You with a template setting out the information required by Us to process a Mass Upload.</li>\n<li>7.3.\nYou are required to follow this template and produce a statement listing the transaction requests for Mass Upload together with attaching invoice(s) in the following format.\nPDF, DOCX, XLS, subject to file size limitation as detailed on the Portal.\nOur requirements and supported formats may be modified by Us from time to time, and We reserve the right to notify You of any modified requirements during the Mass Upload process.</li>\n<li>7.4.\nWe shall validate that the uploaded file contains the necessary information for Mass Uploads, engage with You where there are errors on the uploaded file, and confirm details of the successful Mass Upload when applicable.</li>\n<li>7.5.\nThe payment request can be authorised and the Payer contacted once You authorise same by way of tick box confirmation.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>8.\nReceiving the Funds from the Payer</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>8.1.\nOn Our receipt of funds from Payer We shall provide You with email confirmation within 1 Business Day that a specific Invoice Reference has been discharged pursuant to a Receivables Transaction.</li>\n<li>8.2.\nUnless You provide Us with any instruction to the contrary with regard to these funds, they will be retained by Us in the Virtual Account, in the currency set on that Virtual Account.\nThe decision to use a Virtual Account instead of nominating a Receivables Account is a matter for You and We cannot advise You on the wisest course of action for Your needs.\nThere are risks associated with the use of a Virtual Account and You are advised to seek independent legal and financial advice should You wish to retain funds in a Virtual Account, in particular if You do not have a specific purpose in mind for the onward use of those funds.</li>\n<li>8.3.\nFollowing a specific request from You We shall transfer the funds into Your Receivables Account.\nYou may make this request while the funds are in the Virtual Account or prior to the Payer making the Lodgment.\nWe shall make this transfer within 1 to 2 Business Days of receiving the cleared and settled funds from the Payer.\nThe transfer into the Receivables Account shall specify the name of the Payer and the Invoice Reference to enable You identify the Payment Transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Schedule 5: Security Guidelines</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Words not defined here shall have the meaning set out in the Transfermate Standard Terms and Conditions

is the process by which criminally obtained money or other assets are exchanged for \"clean\" money with no obvious link to its criminal origin.\nBy preventing money laundering, the movement of funds derived from criminal activities will be inhibited.\nThis will in turn, restrict the availability of funds used for terrorist activities.\nTransfermate views Money Laundering as a serious criminal offence, and as such, complies with regulatory requirements intended to forestall and prevent money laundering.\nThese include: <ul>\n<li>Confirming the identity of our clients.</li>\n<li>Retaining transaction and identification records for a minimum period of five years.\n</li>\n<li>Training staff in terms of anti-money laundering regulations.\n</li>\n<li>Appointing a nominated officer responsible for monitoring and reporting any and all suspicious activities to the relevant authorities.\n</li>\n</ul>\nPlease note that Transfermate reserves the right to refuse a transaction at any time should suspicion arise that it may be connected to money laundering or any other criminal activity.\nIn addition, Transfermate will be obliged to report this suspicious activity and in line with regulations, is prohibited from disclosing this to the client.<br>\n<br> By providing us with false identification or contact details, we will deem this a misuse of our service.\nWe are legally bound to report such misdemeanours to the relevant authorities, and as such you may be the subject of a criminal investigation.<br>\n<br> TransferMate will NOT do business with anyone suspected of, or directly involved in Money Laundering, or where funds have been sourced by any illegal activity.\n<br>\n<br> To assist the world wide fight against the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, world wide laws require TransferMate to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account with us.\nThis can be done in many ways, some of which may require you to provide documentation.\nBelow are examples of documentation that may be required.\nYour customer service representative will guide you through this process.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Examples of Information required </b>\n<br>\n<br> When you open an account, your will be asked for information such as your, Name, Date of birth, Address, Identification numbers and source of funds.\nTo verify this information, Transfermate uses the latest available technology, but you maybe asked for identification documents such as, certified copies of documents showing nationality, residence, your address and a photograph of you.\nTypical verification documents are your passport/drivers licence plus a utility bill/bank statement.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Companies </b>\n<br>\n<br> When you open an account, a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity may need to provide other information, such as its principal place of business, local office, employer identification number.\nTo verify this information, Transfermate uses the latest available technology but you may be asked for certified articles of incorporation, government-issued business license, a partnership agreement or a trust agreement.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Certification </b>\n<br>\n<br> If you are required to provide certified copy documents, they must be of good quality, signed and dated with the words \"True copy of the original\" (or similar) and can be certified by the following people: accountant, lawyer, police officer or your bank manager.\nIf you cannot get one of these people you customer relationship representive will work with you to find an appropriate substitute The person certifying the ID document should be contactable so please write their contact details on the copy of the document.\nThis information needs to be scanned back to us and the originals posted to the firm.\nTransferMate may conduct additional security checks on clients at our discretion.\n<br>\n<br> Your Customer Service
