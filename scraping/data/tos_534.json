for California Residents,\u201d below, for more information about our practices and your rights.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Last updated March 30, 2020</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT IS KAHOOT?</strong>\n<br>\nKahoot provides a game-based learning tool that can be played through most web browsers (at http://kahoot.it) and through our App.\nA Kahoot game (referred to as a \u201cKahoot\u201d) consists of players answering multiple-choice questions presented on the screen of the user who hosts the particular game or, in un-hosted games, on the screens of the participants in the particular game itself.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>\n<br>\n\u201cPersonal Information\u201d is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable person, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address (required)</li>\n<li>Date of birth (required for students and social users)</li>\n<li>Company or organization (of work-related users)</li>\n<li>Financial information (required when signing up for Kahoot Plus \u201cthe Paid Subscriptions\u201d)</li>\n<li>School or university (of students and teachers)</li>\n<li>Biographical information (for teachers who elect to provide it)</li>\n<li>Chosen username and password for Kahoot account (required)</li>\n<li>Profile picture</li>\n<li>Your interests (such as arts, biology, chemistry, history, music, law etc.)</li>\n<li>Your teaching level, if you are a teacher (such as kindergarten, grade level, higher education, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We need to collect and process Personal Information marked as \u2018required\u2019 in order to provide the requested Services to you, or because we are legally required to do so.\nIf you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide the requested Services.</p>\n<p>If you submit any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the Services, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal information we collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not collect any Personal Information from a person who merely plays a Kahoot except if you participate in a Kahoot! which is hosted using the Player Identifier feature.\nFurther information regarding Player Identifier is included below.\nIn order to be able to create and host a Kahoot, however, a user (\u201caccountholder\u201d) must create an account at&nbsp;https://create.kahoot.it/account/register/ or through our App.\nAs described in more detail below, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information from adult accountholders.\nAn \u201cadult accountholder\u201d is a U.S.\nuser who is age 13 or older or a user from outside the U.S.\nwho is age 16 or older.</p>\n<p>Our information practices are different with respect to younger users.\nSpecifically, when a U.S.\nuser who is under the age of 13 or a user from outside the U.S.\nwho is under the age of 16 creates an account (a \u201cchild accountholder\u201d), we collect his or her email address only for the purpose of providing password reminders to him or her.\nWe collect no other Personal Information from child accountholders, and we immediately and permanently alter the email address such that it can only be used as a password reminder and cannot be reconstructed into its original form or used to contact the child accountholder.\nKahoot also collects a user name and password from child accountholders, which are used for login purposes only.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Player Identifier</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Player Identifier is a game option that allows a host to track progress and scores of the players who have permitted you to do so.\nBy default, the Player Identifier is toggled off, but can be enabled if your payment plan permits use of Player Identifier.</p>\n<p>Player Identifier enables the host, and Kahoot!, to see the email address linked with the nickname of the player as well as the Kahoot! answers provided by such players.\nIf you are a participant in a Player Identifier enabled Kahoot!, you accept that your nickname and email address or any other Personal Information requested by the host are connected and your answers being visible for the host (e.g.\nyour employee number and your last name).\nThis means that when you participate in a Player Identifier game, both Kahoot! and your host can see and store the email address or any other Personal Information you have connected with your nickname, as well as your Kahoot! answers.\nWe process your Personal Information for the purpose of providing the Player Identifier functionality to the host.\nThe Personal Information will not be visible for other players during or after the game.</p>\n<p>Please note that the host using Player Identifier feature is the data controller of all personal data provided by the players in the host\u2019s Kahoot! and therefore responsible for ensuring that such personal data is lawfully collected and processed in accordance with applicable legislation.\nKahoot! will only act as a data processor with respect to any such personal data and will process and store this data on behalf of the host.\nThe host is responsible for ensuring that any collection and processing of personal data from participants in a Player Identifier enabled game is carried out in accordance with applicable law, including e.g.\nhaving obtained consent from the participant, if required.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Collect Personal Information</strong>\n<br>\nWe and our service providers collect Personal Information from adult accountholders in

Information</strong>\n<br>\nWe and our third party service providers collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Through your browser or device</strong>: Certain

system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.\nWe use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Through your use of the App:</strong> When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers and what information has been downloaded to the App based on your device number.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Using cookies:</strong> Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.\nCookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.\nWe and our service providers use the information only to support the internal operations of the Services, such as for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.\nWe also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.</p>\n<p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.\nYou may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.\nIf, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.\nFor example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:</strong> Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including adult accountholders that may receive emails from us), measure the success of marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics:</strong> We use third parties, including Google Analytics, which use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.\nYou can learn about Google\u2019s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IP Address</strong>: Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).\nAn IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.\nCollecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.\nWe use IP addresses for the purposes of providing support for the internal operations of the Services, such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Services.\nWe may also derive your approximate, general, location from your IP address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>From you:</strong> Information such as communications preference may be collected from adult accountholders when they voluntarily provide it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>By aggregating information:</strong> Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Use and Disclose Other Information</strong>\n<br>\nWe use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.\nIn some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information.\nIf we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OUR COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</strong>\n<br>\nWe do not knowingly seek or collect Personal Information from users under the age of 13 (for U.S.\nusers) or 16 (for non-U.S.\nusers).\nIf we determine we have inadvertently gathered Personal Information from users under the age of 13 (for U.S.\nusers) or 16 (for non-U.S.\nusers), we will promptly delete any and all such Personal Information from our records.<br>\nWe and our service providers collect information that is reasonably necessary to support the

address only for the purpose of providing password reminders.\nWe immediately and permanently alter the email address such that it can only be used as a password reminder and cannot be reconstructed into its original form or used to contact the child accountholder.<br>\nTo permit the child accountholder to use the Services, we also collect a username and password, which are used for login purposes only.</p>\n<p>We and our service providers collect the information described above, under \u201cOther Information,\u201d from child accountholders.\nhowever, we restrict the use of persistent identifiers for children accountholders.\nSpecifically, we utilize pseudonymous identifiers to understand, among other things, the volume of unique users using our Services, and we limit the geolocation information that we collect to no more precise than a city-wide area.\nOur collection persistent identifiers from child accountholders does not allow us to identify, contact or create a profile of such users.</p>\n<p>The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (U.S.), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (U.S.), the General Data Protection Regulation (E.U.) and other data privacy laws have been established to protect the privacy of minors.\nWe take our compliance obligations under such laws, and the privacy of our users generally, very seriously.</p>\n<p>If you would like to review the information we have collected from your child (i.e., his or her username and password), or if you would like to ask us to make no further use of, or delete, the information we have collected from your child, contact us as described in the \u201cContacting Us\u201d section, below.\nIn your request, please include your name and your child\u2019s Kahoot!
