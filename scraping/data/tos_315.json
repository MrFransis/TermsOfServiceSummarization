Inc.\n(\u201cwikiHow,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d).\nOur Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, share, and protect your information, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.\n</p>\n<p>When you visit or use the Services, you expressly consent to the collection, use, storage, processing, and disclosure of your information, including personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.\nIf there is something in this Policy or the Terms of Use that you disagree with, you should not access or use the Services.\n</p> How We Collect and Use Information <p>We collect the following types of information about you:\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Information you provide us directly</u>:<br>\nWe ask for certain information such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>your username, real name, birthdate, address, phone number and email address when you register for a wikiHow account, or if you correspond with us.\nWe collect your email address when you choose to sign up for our newsletters.</li>\n<li>We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service.</li>\n<li>We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.\nYour username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly.\nOnce published, your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed entirely from the Service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n<u>Information we may receive from third parties</u>:<br>\nWe may receive information about you from third parties.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by \u201cfollowing,\u201d \u201cliking,\u201d adding the wikiHow application, linking your account to the wikiHow Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to wikiHow.</li>\n<li>This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.</li>\n<li>If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends\u2019 user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join wikiHow.\nYou should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the wikiHow Service.\nYou may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\nInviting a friend to use wikiHow:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to invite third parties to the Service.\nIf you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our \u201cInvite friends\u201d feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device\u2019s native contact list \u2013 but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list.\nYou understand that by inviting a friend to wikiHow through the \u201cInvite friends\u201d feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list.\nIn addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from your phone.\nSince this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\nFinding your friends on the Service:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, develop a feature that allows you to locate your friends with wikiHow accounts through a \u201cFind friends\u201d feature.\nThe \u201cFind friends\u201d feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on wikiHow.\nIf you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide wikiHow access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using wikiHow.\nIf you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites.\nIf you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames, then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service.\nNote that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on wikiHow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\nAnalytics information:<br>\nWe may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.\nThese tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service.\nWe collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies information:<br>\nFull details can be found on our Cookie Policy.\nWhen you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies \u2014 a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters \u2014 to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets wikiHow help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.\nA cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your

you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.\n</p>\n<p>Clear gifs/web beacons information:<br>\nWhen you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.\nIn addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.\nThe information provided by these clear gifs allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.\n</p>\n<p>Device identifiers:<br>\nWhen you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more \u201cdevice identifiers,\u201d such as a universally unique identifier (\u201cUUID\u201d).\nDevice identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or

identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service.\nSome features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.\n</p>\n<p>Location data:<br>\nWhen you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store \u201clocation data,\u201d which may include GPS coordinates (e.g.\nlatitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.\nLocation data may convey to

Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices).\nYou may not opt out of Service-related emails.\nYou may also be able to be \u201cfound\u201d on wikiHow based on information that you provide (see \u201cFind friends on wikiHow\u201d) above.\n</p>\n<p>Use of certain service type information we collect about you:<br>\nWe use or may use cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs information to:\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>a) remember information so

below.\nIf you chose to use our Services, we may also publish your information online as outlined below.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may share your information with third-party business partners and Trusted Users for the purpose of providing the Service to you.\nAs further described in our Terms of Use, wikiHow may provide certain Users with administrative privileges in order to monitor or provide certain aspects of the Service (\u201cTrusted Users\u201d)</li>\n<li>If you choose to sign up for our newsletters, your email address will be shared Mailchimp.\nSee Mailchimp\u2019s privacy policy for details about how Mailchimp manages and secures your information.</li>\n<li>We work with various organizations and individuals to help provide our Services to you (\u201cService Providers\u201d), such as website and data hosting companies and companies providing analytics information.\nWe need to engage such third-party Service Providers to help us operate, provide, and market our Services.\nThese third parties have only limited access to your information and may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.\nInformation we share with our Service Providers may include both information you provide to us and information we collect about you, including personal information.\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure that our Service Providers are obligated to reasonably protect your information on our behalf.\nIf we become aware that a Service Provider is using or disclosing information improperly, we will take commercially reasonable steps to end or correct such improper use or disclosure.\nWe share personal information with our Service Providers on the legal basis of our legitimate interests in providing you with our services.\nOur engagement of Service *Providers is often necessary for us to provide the services to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our services operating and secure.\nIn some other cases, these Service Providers aren\u2019t strictly necessary for us to provide our services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users.\nIn these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our services better.</li>\n<li>Please see below regarding third party advertising services that we may use to display ads on the Service and the information that may be provided to them.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<u>Who can see User Content</u>: Any User Content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service becomes available to the public and cannot be removed, except by wikiHow in its sole discretion.\nOnce posted on wikiHow, User Content may not be removable from public view, as copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, on other sites that have republished us, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.\nIf you do not wish your User Content to be available to the public, please don\u2019t post it on wikiHow.\nYour username and if you choose to disclose it, your real name, will be published publicly.\nOnce published your username and / or real name may not be able to be removed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Who can see your IP address</u>: If you post User Content on the Service while not logged in, your IP address will be published with your User Content in order to attribute your contribution to the Service.\nA selection of Trusted Users with administrative powers on wikiHow have the ability to review IP addresses of users to reduce abusive behavior.\nAny third party service embedded on wikiHow such as an advertiser, video provider, social network or other third party will also have access to your IP address.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Who can see your email address</u>: If you enter an email address, you will enable communication from wikiHow and other Users.\nIf you reply to users or participate in group wikiHow activities such as meetups, your email address will be shared with these users.\nIn addition, some email addresses such as blocked@wikiHow.com forward to a group of Trusted Users, who will use your email address to reply to the email.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>What happens in the event of a change of control:</b>\n<br>\nWe may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses.\nYour information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions.\nWe may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Instances where we are required to share your information:</b>\n<br>\nwikiHow will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement.\n(b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our Service.\nand/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of wikiHow, our Users, or others.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</b>\n<br>\nWe may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on \u201cHow We Collect and Use Information.\u201d We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ads on wikiHow:</b>\n<br>\nWe may also share certain information such as your location, browser, cookie data, and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (\u201cads\u201d) that may be of interest to you.\nwikiHow may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service.\nThese third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so.\nThey may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser\u2019s or device\u2019s visits and usage patterns on the Service and on other websites, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content delivered to you.\n</p>\n<p>For example, Google uses DART cookies in order to deliver ads to you through the Service.\nGoogle's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Service and previous websites that you may have visited.\nOther advertising networks also use similar cookies, clear gifs, or other mechanisms to deliver targeted advertising to you through the Service.\nYou can delete these cookies by following the instructions here.\nYou may opt out of use of Google\u2019s DART cookie and cookies placed by Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) certified ad networks here.\nOpting out of these cookies will be effective not only on the Service, but on all websites with NAI certified advertising networks.\nHowever, these opt-outs will be ineffective on networks that are not NAI certified.\n</p>\n<p>Please note that an advertiser may ask wikiHow to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests).\nIn that situation, wikiHow or our advertising partners determines the target audience and wikiHow serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous data to the advertiser.\nIf you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.\nTo enhance your user experience or help us improve and measure our effectiveness, wikiHow may embed code from third parties on the Service.\nExamples of such parties may include\n</p>\n<dl>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Pinterest</li>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>These third parties may collect information about you including IP address, cookies in ways wikiHow does not control.\n</p>\n<p>The wikiHow Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of third-parties.\nPlease consult the respective privacy policies of such third parties or contact such third parties for more information.\n</p> How We Store and Protect Your Information <p>Storage and

providers maintain facilities.\nwikiHow may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.\nIf you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.\nlaw, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S.\nor any other country in which wikiHow or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>Keeping your information safe:<br>\nwikiHow cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service.\nTo protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from wikiHow, at all times.\nHowever, wikiHow cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to wikiHow or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.\nYour privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the wikiHow Service, such as social networks.\nwikiHow is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.\n</p>\n<p>Compromise of information:<br>\nIn the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, wikiHow will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p> Your Choices about Your Information <p>You

security notices).\nIf you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at wiki@wikihow.com.\n</p>\n<p>Opting out of collection of your information for Tracking / Advertising:<br>\nPlease refer to your mobile device or browser\u2019s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.\nDepending on your type of device, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile device.\nNote that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents wikiHow or its business partners from tracking your browser\u2019s activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted advertising activities by third parties.\nHowever, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service.\nIf you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at privacy@wikihow.com.\n</p>\n<p>How long we keep your private profile information:<br>\nFollowing termination of your User account, wikiHow may retain your private profile information for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, any information that you choose to make public on the service may not be removable.\n</p>

you agree that we are not responsible and we do not control over any third-parties that you authorize to access your User Content.\nIf you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook, Google groups, or an IRC chatroom) and you allow such a third-party access to your User Content, you do so at your own risk.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service.\n</p> EU Privacy Rights <p>For the purposes of the processing of personal data of individuals in the European Union
