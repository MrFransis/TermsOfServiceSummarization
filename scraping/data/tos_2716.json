the refund.</p>\n<p>12.4.2 In the case of a contract for Services, the following shall apply: If the Consumer requested that the Services commence during the revocation period, the Consumer shall pay

the contract.\nThe deadline is met if the Consumer sends the goods before the expiration of the fourteen-day period.\nThe Consumer shall bear the direct costs of returning the goods.</p>\n<p>The

behalf of CyberGhost will debit your credit card or bank account on the last day of the following month or following year.\nFor example, if your Pay Scale was set for use on January 31, February 28 is the following invoicing date.</p>\n<p>[Coming soon: If you decide to make an Upgrade of your Premium-Pay Scale, the start date of your next invoicing period will be restored and the first month or the

prior Premium-Pay Scale.\nThe next payment will be then due on the 20th of May.]</p>\n<p>CyberGhost can change the applicable fees and costs or may charge from time to time additional fees and costs.\nYou will be informed in advance by e-mail on such changes.\nYou are responsible to update your contact data and payment information.</p>\n<p>Your Premium-Pay Scale will be valid until you
