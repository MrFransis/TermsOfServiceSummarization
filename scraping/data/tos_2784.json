ONLY.\nYOU SHOULD PRINT A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR YOUR RECORDS.</p>1.\nWHAT ARE YOU AGREEING TO?<p>\n<strong>The Parties to this Agreement.</strong> These Terms of Service describe a contractual relationship (\"Agreement\") between you (\"you\" or \"your\") and Affirm, Inc.\n(including its subsidiaries, affiliates, including Affirm Loan Services, LLC, agents, and assigns) (\"Affirm,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\"), formerly known as Expedite, Inc.\nor Expedite Software, regarding (1) your use of this website (\"Website\") or any mobile application offered by or marketed by or on behalf of Affirm or any other technology platform offered by Affirm, (each an \"Affirm App\"), (2) your use of the Website, an Affirm App, or a third-party website in connection with a product or service offered directly by Affirm, as applicable, (3) your use of \"Additional Tools\" as described below in Section 2, (4) your use of any other service(s) offered through the Website or an Affirm App, as applicable, <strong>including, without limitation, loans and savings accounts;</strong> and (5) your access to your Affirm account information and <strong>access to any</strong> service through the Website or an Affirm App (collectively, the \"Affirm Service(s)\" or \"Service(s)\").\nWe may partner with banks (each, a \"Bank Partner\") to offer certain products and services and we offer certain products and services directly to you.\nIf you are approved for a product offered through Affirm by one of these Bank Partners, or through other partnerships with Bank Partners, you will enter into an agreement with the Bank Partner.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any agreement you enter into with a Bank Partner (and not this Agreement) will control with respect to the associated Bank Partner product.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to this Agreement.</strong> Affirm may unilaterally decide to change this Agreement from time to time, provided, however, that such changes will not impose additional obligations on you with respect to actions you took before the change became effective unless you specifically agree to such changes (for example, by confirming a loan).\nAdditionally, YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT ANY CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT BY USING THE AFFIRM SERVICES AFTER CHANGES HAVE BEEN POSTED.\nIf Affirm makes any changes to this Agreement that it deems to be material, Affirm will make a reasonable effort to inform you of such changes, but it is your responsibility to review the Agreement posted to our website from time to time to see if it has been changed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Eligibility</strong> To be eligible to use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old (19 years old in Alabama or if you are a ward of the state in Nebraska) and a resident of the United States or its territories.\nLoans originated by a Bank Partner or directly by Affirm may not be available in all states.\nYou represent and warrant that you are eligible to use the Services.</p>2.\nHOW AFFIRM WILL SERVE YOU<p>\n<strong>Buy with Affirm:</strong> When you buy with Affirm you may be offered a closed-end installment loan product with terms as expressed in your Loan Agreement.\nLoans may be offered by a Bank Partner through Affirm's technology platform or by Affirm directly through Affirm's technology platform or through a third-party website.\nLoan term options may vary based on purchase price and merchant and may not be available in all states.\nAffirm's services allow you to buy goods or services offered by merchants (\"Merchants\") for personal use.\nIf you buy with Affirm, either Affirm or Bank Partner (the \"Lender\"), depending on the product, will pay the Merchant on your behalf in exchange for your promise to repay the same amount plus a finance charge, where applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Promise to Pay:</strong> Before completing any transaction on your behalf through any Affirm Services, Affirm will secure your promise to pay by disclosing the terms and conditions applicable to that transaction and securing your affirmative consent to those terms for that transaction, including your promise to pay the Total Payments amount to Lender or its assigns, by asking you to click the button to confirm your loan.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Rates range from 0% to 30% fixed Annual Percentage Rate (\"APR\"), depending on your creditworthiness and/or the type of product offered (0% APR may only be offered at select merchants).\nLoans are simple interest loans, which means that interest, if any, accrues daily on the unpaid principal balance, up to the amount of the finance charge, until you pay the loan in full.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Finance Charge:</strong> Loans may be subject to a finance charge based on the applicable interest rate.\nThe Lender will always disclose the specific finance charge before you agree to any loan.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Late Payment Fee:</strong> You will never be charged any late fees when you buy with Affirm.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Delays in Processing:</strong> In some cases, when you buy with Affirm to make a purchase, the transaction may be held as pending or be otherwise delayed for processing and confirmation by either Affirm or the merchant and can be cancelled at any time until it is confirmed by Affirm.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Extended Ship Date:</strong> If when buying with Affirm, one or more items in your order has an extended ship date, your loan payment(s), including interest, may be due before the merchant ships the item(s).\nPlease note that you may not receive a rebate of any interest that may have already accrued on an amount that later gets refunded.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Savings Account.</strong> Savings account service is provided by Cross River Bank, Member FDIC.\nRefer to the Cross River Bank Deposit Account Agreement for details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Affirm-Originated Loans.</strong> Loans may be offered directly by Affirm.\nRefer to your

services.\nUnless we indicate otherwise, these tools will be provided free of charge and are provided exclusively for personal use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Autofill of Information:</strong> In order for you to have a more seamless shopping experience while using your payment instrument with another financial institution, we will store some of the information that you provide to us, or that you authorize a third party to provide to us, or that a third party provides to us about you, and use that information to autofill different forms for you during your shopping journey.\nMore detail on how it works is below.\nWhile using the Services, we may ask for your personal information and contact details such as name, shipping address, telephone number, email, VCN card details, debit/credit card details (excluding CVV), and billing address for those cards, or you may authorize our service providers to provide us with information about you, such as details about your financial accounts, transactions, and credit history.\nWe will keep this information in our systems so that when you return to us, you will only need to provide basic details in order for us to automatically fill in the remaining fields to complete your transaction.\nWhen you shop with a merchant directly from an Affirm App, we can autofill your details on the merchant's site.\nThis is enabled when you log in to an Affirm App so that we know it is you that is shopping with that merchant.\nIf you no longer want to use the autofill feature for payments, you can go to the Profiles Tab in the Affirm mobile app and remove your payment instrument under Payment Methods.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitations on Tools:</strong> You agree that we may modify the tools or cease making them available to you at any time without notice.\nWe

regarding financial accounts you may have with other lenders or financial institutions, you understand that the information may not be up to date.\nBefore acting on any such information, you should confirm its accuracy with the lender or financial institution holding the account.\nThere may be times when a tool we offer is unavailable or not properly functioning, and you agree that we have no liability to you if this occurs or in connection with the tools generally.\nYou may need certain hardware or software to utilize the tools, and you understand that your failure to have such hardware or software will result in your not being able to use the tools or some tool functionality.\nYou understand that some tools or some tool functionality may only be available to consumers who have relationships with certain lenders, service providers or financial institutions or who have certain financial products.\nIf you do not have such relationships or products, you understand that you may not be eligible to use a tool or all of its functionality.\nYou agree that we may use information we gather through the tools to market other products and/or services to you, including those of third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Providers:</strong> We may rely on third party providers to assist us in making a tool or other Affirm Service available to you.\nBy linking your bank account to a tool or Service, you authorize us and our third party providers to access your financial accounts on your behalf, and to gather information about you.\nYou give us and our third party providers a limited power of attorney, and appoint us and our third party providers as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent to act on your behalf and access, transmit, and use your information as

CAREFULLY BEFORE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BY USING THE AFFIRM SERVICE OR THE WEBSITE.\n</p>\n<p>Unless you are a covered borrower as defined by the Military Lending Act, 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 987, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Website, your use of the Affirm Services, a product offered or provided by or through the Website or Service, or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services that cannot be resolved directly between you and Affirm shall be resolved by binding arbitration under the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\"the Consumer Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), rather than in court.\nExcept as otherwise explicitly provided in this Section, this broadly includes: any claims based in contract, statute, tort, fraud, consumer rights, misrepresentation, equity or any other legal theory.\ninitial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims.\nfederal, state and local claims.\nand claims which arose before the date of this Agreement.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\") and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.\nThe arbitrator shall apply applicable statutes of limitations and honor privilege rules.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator will be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT YOUR CONSENT TO ARBITRATION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>\n<p>Either you or we can initiate arbitration through AAA, an alternative dispute resolution provider, or by filing a motion to compel arbitration of claims filed in court.\nRegardless of who elected arbitration or how arbitration was elected, the party asserting the claim (i.e., the party seeking money damages or other relief from a court or an arbitrator) is responsible for starting the arbitration proceeding.\nIf AAA cannot serve, a court with jurisdiction shall select the arbitrator, who will apply the AAA rules and procedures specified in this Section.\nAny arbitration will be governed by the then-current Consumer Rules of the AAA, and its Procedures for the Resolution of Disputes through Document Submission (\"Document Submission Procedures\").\nThe Consumer Rules are available at the AAA website: www.adr.org.\nThe Document Submission Procedures are included in the Consumer Rules.\nYour arbitration filing fees will be governed by the Consumer Rules.\nIf it is determined by the arbitrator that you cannot afford such fees, Affirm will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\nThe arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions.\nThe arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that a telephonic or in-person conference or hearing is necessary based on the request of one or more of the parties.\nDisputes or controversies about the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Section or any part thereof are for a court and not an arbitrator to decide.\nhowever, disputes or controversies about the Agreement as a whole are for an arbitrator and not a court to decide.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:</strong> You and Affirm each agree that any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class, consolidated or representative action.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration will be joined or consolidated with any other.\n(b) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action or private attorney general basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (c) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\nNo arbitrator shall have the authority to issue any relief that applies to any person or entity other than Affirm and/or you individually.</p>\n<p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nEven if all parties have opted to litigate a claim in court, a party may elect arbitration with respect to any claim made by a new party or any claim later asserted by a party in that or any related or unrelated lawsuit (including a claim initially asserted on an individual basis but modified to be asserted on a class, representative or multi-party basis).\nNothing in that litigation shall constitute a waiver of any rights under this Section.\nYou and Affirm each agree that any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of intellectual property rights will not be subject to binding arbitration under this Section.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Consumer Rules, any party may proceed with their individual claims in small claims court if that option is available in the applicable jurisdiction and the amount in controversy falls within the small claims court\u2019s jurisdictional limits.\nbut if that action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court, arbitration can be elected.\nIf any portion of this Section is inconsistent with the Consumer Rules or other
