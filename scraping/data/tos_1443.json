information can be collected and used by others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Cookies.<p>Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.\n\"Cookies\" are small pieces of information that a website stores to your computer or mobile device while you access the website.\nWe may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website.\nThis type of information is collected to make the website more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.\nWe use the following types of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Essential Cookies -</strong> These cookies are essential to provide you with the Services and to enable you to use some of its features.\nFor example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly.\nWithout these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functionality Cookies - </strong> These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use the Services, such as login details and progress within a course.\nThe purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit the Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analytics and Performance Cookies - </strong> These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the Services and how they are used.\nThe information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, and is aggregated and anonymized.\nIt includes information like the number of visitors to our website, referring websites, pages viewed on our website, what time of day they visited our website, and whether they have visited our website before.\nWe use this information to help operate our website more

beacons, or Web bugs).\nPixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are used to track online movements of Web users.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages.\nPixel tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.\nWe do not tie the information gathered by pixel tags to our users\u2019 personal information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong> Some internet browsers may be configured to send \"Do Not Track\"

carefully.\nIt is part of your contract with Parsec and affects your rights.\nIt contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nAll claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Parsec that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.\nUnless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings will be held in English.<strong>This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Parsec, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.\nIf non-appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\nThe arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>\n<p>Time Limits.\nIf you or Parsec pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p>\n<p>Authority of Arbitrator.\nIf arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Parsec, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator may award monetary damages, and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Parsec.</p>\n<p>Waiver of Jury Trial.\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes will be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and Parsec in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND PARSEC WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.</p>\n<p>If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this section\u2019s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York.\nAll other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.</p>\n<p>Confidentiality.\nAll aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, will be strictly confidential.\nThe parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\nThis paragraph will not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement or an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>\n<p>Severability.\nIf any part of this Arbitration Agreement are found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts will be of no force and effect and will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>Right to Waive.\nAny or all the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>Small Claims Court.Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Parsec may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>\n<p>Emergency Equitable Relief.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.\nA request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets will not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York County, New York, for such purpose.</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: legal@parsec.app, within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address, your Parsec username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Export.<p>The Services may be subject to U.S.\nexport control laws

to\u201d.\nIf any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nYour relationship to Parsec is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.\nThese Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Parsec\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.\nParsec may freely assign these Terms.\nThe terms and conditions set forth in these Terms will be binding upon assignees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Severability.<p>If any portion of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a manner to reflect, as
