the other purposes mentioned.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject</strong>.\nWe process your data to comply with a range of legal obligations and statutory requirements.\nFor example, in Australia, we're required to identify you in accordance with our obligations under the <i>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006</i> (Cth), determine and report in respect of your foreign tax residency status and where you apply for consumer credit - to ascertain and verify your financial situation in accordance with our responsible

ING employee or visit a branch, we may gather information about the customer.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Improving and developing products and services</strong>.\nAnalysing how products and services are

management reporting.</strong> We process personal data for our financial services operations and to help our management make better decisions about our operations and services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Safety and security.</strong>We have a duty to protect all personal data and to prevent, detect and contain a data breach or fraud involving personal data collected to comply with regulations against money laundering, terrorism financing and tax fraud.\nTo safeguard and ensure the security and integrity of ING, the financial sector, clients and employees, we may</p>\n<li>Process your personal data to protect your organisation\u00b4s assets from fraudulent activities, for instance in case your identity (e.g.\nusername and password) is

it.\n</li>\n<li>Use your personal data to alert you in case we detect suspicious activities involving your business\u00b4s assets, for example a transaction is taking place from a non-typical location.\n</li>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance with legal obligations to which we are subject.\n</strong>We process personal data to comply with a range of legal obligations and statutory requirements (anti-money laundering legislation and tax legislation etc.).\nFor example, know your customer (KYC) rules and regulations require ING to verify the identity before accepting you as a customer.\nUpon request by authorities, ING may report the transactions carried out by customers.\n</p>\n<p>When processing is not compatible with one of the above purposes, we ask for your explicit consent, which you may withhold or withdraw at any time.\n</p>\n<p>Applicable laws require us to retain personal data for a period of time.\nThis retention period may vary from a few months to a several years, depending on the applicable local law.\nWhen your personal data is no longer necessary for a process or activity for which it was originally collected, we delete it, or bundle data at a certain abstraction level (aggregate), render it anonymous and dispose of it in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.</p> 4.\nWho we share your data with and why <p>To offer you the best possible services and remain competitive in our business, we share certain data internally i.e., with other ING businesses and externally (i.e., outside of ING) with third parties.\n</p>\n<p>Whenever we share your personal data externally (i.e., outside of ING) with third parties in countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) we ensure the necessary safeguards are in place to protect it.\nFor this purpose, we rely upon, amongst others: </p>\n<p>Requirements based on applicable local laws and regulations.\n</p>\n<p>EU Model clauses, when applicable, we use standardised contractual clauses in agreements with service providers to ensure personal data transferred outside of the European Economic Area complies with GDPR.\n</p>\n<p>International treaties such as the EU US Privacy Shield framework that protects personal data transferred to certain service providers in the United States.</p>\n<p>For all customers:</p> ING entities <p>We transfer data across ING businesses and branches for various purposes (see section \u2018What we do with your personal data\u2019 for the full list).\nWe may also transfer data to centralised storage systems or to process it at a central point within ING for efficiency purposes.\nFor all internal data transfers we rely on our binding corporate rules as defined in EC Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which is our Global Data Protection Policy (GDPP), and on the applicable local laws and regulations.</p> Government, Supervisory and Judicial authorities <p>To comply with our regulatory obligations we may disclose data to the relevant government, supervisory and judicial authorities such as: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Public authorities, regulators</strong> and <strong>supervisory bodies</strong> such as the central banks and other financial sector supervisors in the countries where we operate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong> Tax authorities</strong> may require us to report customer assets or other personal data such as your name and contact details and other information about your organisation.\nFor this purpose, we may process your identification data like social security number, tax identification number or any other national identifier in accordance with applicable local law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Judicial/investigative authorities</strong> such as the police, public prosecutors, courts and arbitration/mediation bodies on their express and legal request.\n</p> Financial institutions <p>To process certain payment and withdrawal services, we may have to share information about the customer or its representative with another bank or a specialised financial company.\nWe also share information with financial sector specialists who assist us with financial services like</p>\n<p>exchanging secure financial transaction messages </p>\n<p>payments and credit transactions worldwide </p>\n<p>processing electronic transactions worldwide</p>\n<p>settling domestic and cross-border security transactions and payment transactions.</p>\n<p>Other financial services organisations, including banks, superannuation funds, stockbrokers, custodians, fund managers and portfolio service providers.</p> Service providers and other third parties <p>When we use other service providers or other third parties to carry out certain activities in the normal course of business, we may have to share personal data required for a particular task.\nService providers support us with activities like </p>\n<p>Designing, developing and maintaining internet-based tools and applications;</p>\n<p>IT service providers who may provide application or infrastructure (such as cloud) services;</p>\n<p>Marketing activities or events and managing customer communications.\n</p>\n<p>Preparing reports and statistics, printing materials and designing products.\n</p>\n<p> Placing advertisements on apps, websites and social media.\n</p>\n<p>Legal, auditing or other special services provided by lawyers, notaries, trustees, company auditors or other professional advisors.\n</p>\n<p>Identifying, investigating or preventing fraud or other misconduct by specialised companies;</p>\n<p>Performing specialised services like postal mail by our agents, archiving of physical records, contractors and external service providers.\nor </p>\n<p>Carrying out securitisation arrangements (such as trustees, investors and the advisers).</p> Account information and payment initiation services within the EU <p>The revised EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2) allows you to instruct a third-party payment service provider (TPP) to retrieve account information or initiate payments on your behalf with respect to your accounts with ING.\nThe TPP may do so only if you have given your explicit consent to those services.</p>\n<p>When we receive a request from a TPP on your behalf, we are obliged to carry out the request for payment or account information, as requested.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally you can also use the PSD2 services to manage your accounts with other banks through your ING channels or apps.\nYou may use the ING app or channel to </p>\n<p>View account information of your current payment accounts with other banks;</p>\n<p>Make online payments from your current payment account with other banks.</p>\n<p>In this case, we will be the TPP and we may only offer these services if we receive your explicit consent.\nIf you decide that you no longer want to use these PSD2 services, you can simply turn off the feature in the ING online environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For individuals who are customers only:</strong>\n</p> Independent agents, brokers and business partners <p>We may share your personal data with independent agents, brokers or business partners who act on our behalf, or which jointly offer products and services with us, such as insurance.\nThey are registered in line with local legislation and operate with due permission of regulatory bodies.\n</p> Researchers <p>We are always looking for new insights to help you get ahead in life and in business.\nFor this reason, we exchange personal data (when it\u2019s legally allowed) with partners like universities and other independent research institutions, who use it in their research and innovation.\nThe researchers we engage must satisfy the same strict requirements as ING employees.\nThe personal data is shared at an aggregated level and the results of the research are anonymous.\n</p> Credit reporting bodies <p>For customers who apply for a credit facility with us in Australia, you agree that we may exchange your personal data with a credit reporting body (\"CRB\"), including by sharing information about:</p>\n<p>your identity</p>\n<p>your credit worthiness</p>\n<li>your credit history, including about the type of credit you have (like credit cards, personal loans and home loans), how much you have borrowed and if you've made your repayments (including repayments you're required to make under your ING credit facility with us) </li>\n<li>whether you have committed fraud or another serious credit infringement, and </li>\n<li>obtaining commercial credit information about you in order to assess an application by you for consumer credit.\n</li>\n<li>The CRBs we use include Equifax Australia Information Services &amp.\nSolutions Pty Limited (\"Equifax\") (equifax.com.au) and illion Australia Pty Ltd (\"illion\") (illion.com.au).\nThe privacy policy of each of Equifax and illion explains how it manages your personal information and can be found on its website.\n</li>\n<p>CRBs may include information that we provide in reports to other credit providers to assist those credit providers to assess your credit worthiness.\nWe may ask a CRB to give us your overall credit score, and we may use credit information from CRBs together with other information to arrive at our own credit score of your ability to manage your credit obligations.\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Pre-screening assessments</i>\n<br> Credit providers (like us) can ask CRBs to use your credit information to pre-screen you for direct marketing purposes, but you can tell CRBs not to do this.\nHowever, by applying for a credit facility with us, you may still receive direct marketing from us (unless you ask us not to) that has not been 'pre screened'.\n</p> Fraud - 'ban period' <p>If you believe, on reasonable grounds, that you have been, or could be, a victim of fraud (for example, someone else may be using your name to apply for credit), you can ask CRBs not to use or give anyone your credit information during a 'ban period'.\n<br> The 'ban period' is a period of 21 days starting on the day you make the request.\nThat period can be extended on your request where the CRB believes on reasonable grounds that you have been, or are likely to be, the victim of fraud.\nBy applying for a credit facility with us, you agree to us accessing your personal information held with a CRB, even if there is a ban period in place, for the purposes of assessing an application for credit or in order to collect overdue payments.\n</p> Credit providers <p>For customers who apply for a credit facility with us in Australia, you agree that we may disclose information about you (including about your credit worthiness, credit history and repayment history information) to other credit providers to assess an application by you for credit, to notify them of a default by you and to inform other credit providers who allege you are in default with them.\nYou also agree that we may disclose your information to any person reasonably necessary for the purposes of that person taking an assignment of any contract the lender has with you.\n</p> Transfer of personal information overseas <p>Sometimes we may send your information overseas - for example, where we send information to ING Group members overseas or outsource functions overseas.\nIf we do this, we make sure there are arrangements in place to protect your information.\nFor customers in Australia, the countries to which your information may be sent include the Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom.\n</p> 5.\nYour rights and how we respect them <p>If your personal data is processed, you have privacy rights.\nBased on applicable laws, your privacy rights may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nIf you have questions about which rights apply to you, please get in touch with us through the email address mentioned in item 9.\n</p>\n<p>We grant the following rights:</p> Right to access information <p>You may request access to limited amounts of personal information that we hold about you - such as your address - by calling us on 133 464.</p>\n<p>For a more detailed request for access to information that we hold about you, you will need to write to the ING Privacy Officer at GPO Box 4094, Sydney NSW 2001.\nWe may request that you specify the information you wish to access, to help us quickly identify and retrieve that information for you.\nPlease note that requests for access to your personal information may only be made by you or by another person who you have authorised to make a request on your behalf, such as a legal guardian or authorised agent.\nWe will require you to verify your identity, or the identity and authority of your representative, to our reasonable satisfaction.\n</p>\n<p>An access charge may apply, but not to your request for access itself.\nIn particular, we may impose a reasonable charge for providing access to this information to recover any expenses incurred in retrieving and collating the requested information.\nWhere an access charge applies, unless you authorise us to debit your account with us, access won't be provided until we receive payment.\nWe will respond to your access request as soon as possible and tell you how long it will take to provide the information.\nThis may be up to 28 days in some circumstances.\n</p>\n<p> We may exercise our right to deny access to particular information in certain situations, for example, where access may reveal our commercially sensitive decision processes (e.g.\ncriteria for loan approvals), where the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings, or where it will threaten the privacy of other individuals.\n</p>\n<p>If we deny you access to your personal information, we will write to you to:</p>\n<p>explain the reason your access request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so in the circumstances.\nand </p>\n<p>the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.</p>\n<p>If we refuse to give you access, if appropriate, we will attempt to find alternative means to enable you to access the information, for example, through a mutually agreed intermediary.</p> Right to rectification <p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate, up-to-date, complete, relevant and not misleading.\nFor instance, we may ask you to confirm some of your details when you speak to our Contact Centre staff.\nHowever, please contact us if you learn that any your personal information that we hold is incorrect, has changed or requires updating.\nYou can update some of your personal information using online banking.</p>\n<p>It may take 28 days or more to consider your correction request in unusual circumstances (e.g., where we are required to consult with other credit reporting bodies and/or credit providers in relation to the information).</p>\n<p>We will promptly update your personal information if it is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading.\nIf we correct the personal information the subject of your correction request and we have previously disclosed that information to a third party, we will notify that third party of the corrected information (if we're required to by law).</p>\n<p>If we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, we will write to you to: explain the reason your correction request has been denied unless it would be unreasonable for us to do so.\nand the avenues available to you to complain about our refusal.\n</p>\n<p>If we disagree with your request to correct your personal information, you also have the right to ask us to attach a statement that in your opinion the information is in your opinion inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading.\nHowever, please note that this right does not apply to our refusal to correct your credit information.</p> Right to object to processing <p>You can object to ING using your personal data for its own legitimate interests if you have a justifiable reason.\nWe will consider your objection and whether processing your information has any undue impact on you that would require us to stop processing your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>You may not object to us processing your personal data if </p>\n<p>We are legally required to do so.\nor</p>\n<p>It is necessary to fulfil a contract with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For individuals who are customers only:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can also object to receiving personalised commercial messages from us.\nWhen you become an ING customer, we may ask you whether you want to receive personalised offers.\nShould you later change your mind, you can choose to opt out of receiving these messages.\nFor example, you can use the <strong>'unsubscribe'</strong> link at the bottom of commercial emails or manage your preferences on our website or mobile banking app.\n</p>\n<p>In addition, even if you opt out of receiving personalised offers, we will alert you to unusual activity on your account, such as:</p>\n<p>When your credit or debit card is blocked;</p>\n<p>When a transaction is requested from an unusual location.\n</p> Right to object to automated decisions <p>We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on your personal information if this is necessary to fulfil a contract with you, or if you gave us consent to do so.\nIn certain circumstances, you may have the right to object to such automated decisions (for example the price we charge for a product or service) and ask for an actual person to make the decision instead.</p> Right to restrict processing <p>You have the right to ask us to restrict using your personal data if</p>\n<p>You believe the personal data is inaccurate;</p>\n<p>We are processing the data unlawfully.\n</p>\n<p>We no longer need the data, but you want us to keep it for use in a legal claim;</p>\n<p>You have objected to us processing your data for our own legitimate interests.</p> Right to data portability <p>You have the right to ask
