Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose your information in three different contexts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When, as a Relying Party, you visit a web site secured with HTTPS that uses a certificate from Let\u2019s Encrypt,</li>\n<li>When you are a Subscriber, i.e., when you request and use certificates from Let\u2019s Encrypt,</li>\n<li>When you are a Visitor to the Let\u2019s Encrypt web site, community discussion forum, other web pages under letsencrypt.org, and third-party social media sites on which Let\u2019s Encrypt operates an account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s Encrypt is a service provided by Internet Security Research Group, a California (United States) Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation.</p>\nRelying Party\n<p>When you use an HTTPS web site or other TLS service with a Let\u2019s Encrypt certificate, your browser (or TLS client) may query Let\u2019s Encrypt to check whether the certificate has been revoked (\u201cOCSP request\u201d).\nIf your browser makes an OCSP request, our servers will automatically record your IP address, browser, and operating system in temporary server log files.\nWe do not use data from OCSP requests to build profiles or identify individuals.\nTemporary server logs are used for operational purposes only and are normally deleted in less than seven days.\nWe may retain a subset of server logs for longer periods in order to investigate software failures or abuse.\nIf we do so, we will delete any stored logs when we are done investigating.\nWe may also compute, retain and publish aggregate information from server logs, such as which certificates generate the largest volume of requests.\nWe will always strive to ensure that such datasets do not contain information about the activities of identifiable users or devices.</p>\nSubscriber\n<p>If you are a Subscriber, you are requesting a trusted certificate from Let\u2019s Encrypt intended to publicly vouch that you control a certain domain name or names that are reachable on the Internet.\nAs part of the process of proving that control, Let\u2019s Encrypt will collect various information related to certificate authentication and management.\nThat information includes the IP addresses from which you access the Let\u2019s Encrypt service.\nall resolved IP addresses for any domain names requested.\nserver information related to any validation requests.\nfull logs of all inbound HTTP / ACME requests, all outbound validation requests.\nand information sent by or inferred from your client software.\nWe will store this information for a minimum of seven years per trusted root program requirements.\nThis information will be stored for a maximum of ten years.</p>\n<p>We need to be able to demonstrate to the public, including those who rely on the trustworthiness of our certificates, that our services perform as expected.\nAs a result, we may be unable to delete information, including IP addresses.\nThis information may be made public in a number of ways, including via public API, public repositories, and/or public discussions.</p>\n<p>You may have the option to provide contact information, such as your email address, for account service and recovery purposes.\nYour contact information will not be made public, and it will only be shared per \u201cLaw Enforcement and Extenuating Circumstances,\u201d below.\nBy providing your email address, you are consenting to receive service-related emails from us.\nYou may unsubscribe from service-related emails at any time by clicking the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link at the bottom of our emails or by contacting us at security@letsencrypt.org.\nWe will not use your contact information for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>\n<p>You may need to download client software from a repository such as those run by Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, or Github.\nYour interaction with such a software repository is governed by that repository\u2019s own privacy policy and/or Terms of Use.</p>\nVisitor\n<p>When you are a Visitor browsing the Let\u2019s Encrypt web site, you have the option to make a donation.\nDonations are processed by our trusted payment partners including DonorBox, Stripe, Shopify, and PayPal, depending on the payment method selected.\nWe collect your name and email address when you donate.\nWe will not use your email address to contact you without your consent unless we feel it\u2019s necessary to resolve an issue related to a particular donation.\nYour interactions with DonorBox, Stripe, and PayPal are governed by their respective privacy policies.\nWe do not collect or retain any credit card or bank information related to donations.\nIf we collect a physical address, we will only retain your physical address information for as long as is reasonably necessary to make the shipment that you requested.\nOur fulfillment partners are Shopify and SHIPHERO.\nYour interactions with Shopify and SHIPHERO are governed by their respective privacy policies.</p>\n<p>You have the option to provide your email address to receive the Let\u2019s Encrypt newsletter through a signup on this web site and via other marketing materials.\nThe newsletter is delivered via MailChimp and your interactions with MailChimp are governed by its privacy policy.\nWe may occasionally use your email address to send personalized communications related to Let\u2019s Encrypt.\nYou can request to have your email address removed from our list by opting out via MailChimp or emailing us at press@letsencrypt.org</p>\n<p>If you register to use the Let\u2019s Encrypt community support forum, the personal information you provide and your actions there are governed by the privacy policy of our hosting and software provider for the forum, Civilized Discourse Construction Kit.\nWe do not collect or maintain personal information through our offering of this support forum.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we use Google Analytics to gauge traffic and popular

a good faith belief it is required by law, such as pursuant to a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order.\nWe may also disclose account recovery information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent loss of life, personal injury, damage to property, or significant financial harm.</p>\n<p>If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice (unless we are prohibited, or it would be futile) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure.\nWe will attempt to provide this notice by whatever means is reasonably practical.\nIf you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information.</p>\n<p>In addition, we reserve the right, solely at our discretion, to independently object to certain requests (for access to information about users of our products and technologies) that we believe to be improper.</p>\nWhat rights do European Economic Area relying parties, subscribers, and visitors have under GDPR, and how can I exercise them?\n<p>We process personal data as
