data.\nLet's begin.\n</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>VISITING OUR WEBSITE</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We have an analytics system.\nWe didn't trust any third party ones.\nSo we built one ourselves instead.\nIt

anonymous, but linked to our support system via anonymous user IDs to better help you out.\nWe keep these only for 90 days.\nOur abuse detection system automatically collects and retains IP addresses and browser user agents for 180 days, but these are deleted once they're no longer relevant.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We rely on awesome and trusty companies called Stripe and Paddle to process your payments, and we use your anonymous user ID to know / track when you paid.</p>\n<small> Our policy is to collect as little user information as possible to ensure a completely private and anonymous user experience when using the Service.\nWe also have no technical means to access the contents of your encrypted data, documents or photos.\nService's user data collection is as follows: <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Visiting our website</strong>\n<br>\n<br> The Service employs an analytics software created specifically by the Company, and not a 3rd party analytics solution to further improve security, privacy and anonymity.\nUsing this solution we may at times track usage metrics, design improvements and track new features' adoption on our pages completely anonymously, without collecting any identifiable pieces of information.\nThese pieces of information are only collected in each unique session, without storing any trackers on the users' devices longer than each session, without tracking across sessions, with the sole purpose to improve our features, improve user experiences, increase new feature adoption and write better tutorials to guide our users.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Account creation</strong>\n<br>\n<br> We do not require ANY personal information to create an account but you may provide an email address for login and password recovery purposes.\nShould you choose to provide it, we do associate these information with your account (to be able to provide you the Service).\nWe will also store your account creation time.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Account activity</strong>\n<br>\n<br> To provide you the Service, we have access to the following metadata: folder colors &amp.\narchive statuses, number of

information is below.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Communicating with the Company</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Your communications with the Company, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests may be saved by our staff, to improve our service and knowledge base featuring frequently asked questions.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Error Reporting &amp.\nAbuse Detection</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Should an error occur while you're using the Service, depending on the error, our automatic error collection and reporting system may collect your unique user ID while reporting the error to our error collection system.\n(processed via Sentry IO, contact details &amp.\nprivacy policy below) These collected Errors are automatically linked to our support system, and can be used to further clarify / investigate issues.\nThese error reports are only retained for 90 days.\nWe do not, and can't collect any personal / identifiable information with our error collection system.\nOur system may collect information like : (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, and (6) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of errors or attacks on our systems.\nOur abuse detection system automatically collects and retains IP addresses and browser user agents for 180 days, however these are deleted once they are no longer relevant.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Payment Information</strong>\n<br>\n<br> The Company relies on third parties to process payments, so the Company necessarily must share your user identification number with the payment processor to be able to know which account the payment will be applied to.\nWe do not otherwise store any of your payment information.\nPayments of users signed up after February 21, 2021 are processed by Stripe.com, 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, and the merchant of record is The Company.\nPayments of users signed up before February 21, 2021 are processed by Paddle.com, Market Ltd, 15 Bermondsey Square, SE1 3UN London, United Kingdom, as merchant of record.\nAs the payment process is entirely and independently carried out by Stripe.com or Paddle.com, you submit the relevant payment data, especially your payment details and your email address, directly to Stripe.com or Paddle.com.\nYou can find their Privacy Policy at stripe.com/privacy and paddle.com/legal.\nIn order to comply with credit card processing requirements, the Service includes third-party javascript from Stripe that may contain other tracking.\nHowever, this content is only loaded on the payment page.\nThe use of your data by Paddle.com is based on Art.\n6 subpara.\n1 point b of GDPR.\nFurthermore, Paddle.com allows the Company to access the following payment data: Your email address, your payment method (e.g.\nby credit card), but not the payment details itself, in order to obtain an overview over the Service's performance.\nThis use is based on Art.\n6 subpara.\n1 point of GDPR, while the legitimate interest of Paddle.com is to transparently communicate its sales of the Service to the Company.\nthe legitimate interest of the Service is to know about its revenues generated by Paddle.com.\nThe user, data subject has the possibility to revoke consent for the handling of personal data at any time from Paddle.\nA revocation shall not have any effect on personal data which must be processed, used or transmitted in accordance with (contractual) payment processing.\n</small>\n<p> DATA<br>USE </p>\n<p> We don't &amp.\nwon't have ads.\nWe will <strong>never</strong> share your data unless for reasons listed in <i>Data Disclosure</i> below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<small> We do not have any advertising on our site.\nAny data that we do have will only be used for providing you the service, and never be shared except under the circumstances described below in Data Disclosure.\nWhen using the collected general data and information listed above, we do not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of the Service correctly, (2) optimize the content of the Service, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our systems and technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, we anonymously analyze collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of the Service, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\n</small>\n</p>\n<p> DATA<br>STORAGE </p>\n<p> Your documents, files and photos are always encrypted, and we can't access any of it.\nWe may have backups (also encrypted) occasionally to be safe, but these are kept for up to 90 days.\n</p>\n<p>\n<small> The contents of your documents/files/photos are ALWAYS stored in encrypted format.\nOffline backups may be stored periodically, but these will be backups of already encrypted files.\nWe do not possess the ability to access the contents of any user's encrypted documents/files/photos on either the live servers or in the backups.\nOn top all this, all services use a second layer of at rest encryption and HTTPS while in transit.\n</small>\n</p>\n<p> DATA<br>RETENTION </p>\n<p> When you delete your account, every piece of data we have about your account in our possession and control is immediately deleted.\nThere may be some leftovers in backups (which by the way are encrypted with your keys, and inaccessible to us/or anyone else), but those will be deleted after 90 days if there hasn't been a disaster.\n</p>\n<p>\n<small> When a user account is deleted, all user data, including encrypted contents of documents/files/photos are immediately deleted from production servers.\nActive accounts will have data retained indefinitely.\nDeleted data may be retained in our backups for up to 90 days, which exists only for disaster recovery and are encrypted with the users' keys, therefore inaccessible to us/or anyone else.\n</small>\n</p>\n<p> DATA<br>DISCLOSURE </p>\n<p> We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we receive an enforceable court order.\n<br>\n<br> If someone wants your data, we can only give them the data listed above in the <i>Data Collection</i> section and the fully encrypted data, which we can't decrypt.\n(and scientifically speaking, nobody should be able to decrypt for the foreseeable million+ years) <br>\n<br> If permitted by law, we will always contact you and let you know if we have a way to reach out to you (for example via Email).\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<small> We will only disclose the limited user data we possess if we receive an enforceable court order.\nIf a request is made for the encrypted contents of documents/files/photos that we do not possess the ability to decrypt, the fully encrypted data or other user data disclosed above in the data collection section may be turned over.\nIf permitted by law, we will always contact a user first before any data disclosure, given that we have a method to contact the user such as the user's email address.\n</small>\n</p>\n<p> INFORMATION<br>REGARDING<br>EU GDPR </p>\n<p> We are fully committed to EU GDPR.<br>\n<br> We can't even access your data.\nOnly you can.\nThat's what GDPR lawyers call magic.\nBasically your data is as private and as safe as it can be on the internet.<br>\n<br> We use a few companies to help us bring you the service such as payments or error reports etc.\nThese companies are:<br>\n<br> Google Cloud Platform, Cloudflare, Sentry IO, Stripe, and Paddle <i>only if you became a paid user before February 21, 2021.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<small> CRYPTEE is fully committed to EU GDPR.<br>\n<br> Based on Article 25 and Recital 78, the Service fits into the category of \"Data protection by design and by default\", by allowing only the users themselves to hold decryption keys, and not having access to the users' unencrypted information.<br>\n<br> We are transparent and upfront with our users regarding the information we process/store, the purpose, and in which form we store it.<br>\n<br> We only transmit user data outside the EU in encrypted form, of which the encryption keys are held by our users and not by us.<br>\n<br> We do not use cookies.\nThe only identifier stored on the site is stored either in indexedDB, localStorage or sessionStorage, employed to authenticate, identify and secure users while using the service.\nMore information regarding this is below in Cookies &amp.\nLocal Storage section.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Name &amp.\nAddress of the Data Controller</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: Svartlab O\u00dc, Estonia.\nhttps://svartlab.com - info@svartlab.com <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Contact Possibility</strong>\n<br>\n<br> The Service contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, which also includes an e-mail address.\nIf a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored.\nSuch personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Minimization, Routine Erasure &amp.\nBlocking of Personal Data</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Due to the nature of the Service, we do not possess any personally identifiable data.\nOther than an email address consensually provided by the data subject to use the Service more conveniently.\nWe process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which we (the controller) is subject to.\nIf the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Transparency &amp.\nData Portability</strong>\n<br>\n<br> We transparently show all our users every piece of information we have linked to their accounts, and allow them to easily see, delete, or export their data.\nSince we do not possess the ability to decrypt our users' encrypted pieces of data, we instead allow our users to export/download these data in the encrypted format we store on our servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Cryptee's Sub-Processors</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Cryptee uses multiple providers (sub-processors) to provide the Service to its users.\nThese processors are all committed to

not use any cookies in the Service.\n(nor any advertising tracking cookies, nor any other form of tracking cookies or user tracking system in general)<br>\n<br> Only pieces of identifiers stored on the user's device locally are stored either in indexedDB, localStorage or sessionStorage, employed to authenticate, identify and secure users while using the service.<br>\n<br> These locally stored pieces of identifiers are used only to prevent abuse, authenticate and remember the user while the user is actively using the Service and navigating between pages.\nAll locally stored information is flushed clean once the user signs out.<br>\n<br> To further improve security, encryption/decryption keys are only stored in memory and flushed once the page is reloaded, even if the user is not signed out.\nTherefore even if a user is not signed out, their files would be encrypted and inaccessible without re-entering this key after reloading the page or navigating away from it.<br>\n<br> We also have a script that regularly deletes all cookies on each page load.\nThis is used as an additional measure to ensure none of our providers can start adding unsolicited cookies in the future.<br>\n<br>\n</small>\n</p>\n<p> MODIFICATIONS<br>TO<br>PRIVACY<br>POLICY </p>\n<p> We might make small changes to this policy some day.\nIf you continue to use the service, we'll assume you're
