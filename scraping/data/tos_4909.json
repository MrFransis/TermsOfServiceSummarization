cooling off period.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>4.8 Expiration of Paid Services.</b>\nIf the Primary Account Holder for the account through which your phone line is subscribed does not provide current

Agreements, are governed by the laws of New York, without regard to New York's conflict or choice of law provisions.\nIf the Class Action Waiver set forth in Subsection 6.2 is not enforceable in arbitration, or if the Dispute Resolution procedure laid out in Subsection 6.3 is unenforceable or does not apply, the parties agree that Subsection 6.3 shall be null and void in its entirety and the federal and state courts of the State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action arising out of or related to the Agreements and personal jurisdiction over each and every party.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.2 Class Action Waiver.</b>\nWHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BRING ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nINSTEAD, YOU AND THE COMPANY MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.\nFURTHERMORE, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND THE

intellectual property, including infringement of a trademark or servicemark or copying or distributing the Protected Data, the claiming party need not rely on binding arbitration and need not attempt informal resolution, but instead may immediately seek relief in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nFor such actions, the parties consent to jurisdiction in the State of New York.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Small Claims.</b> The claimant may seek resolution of any dispute in small claims court in Suffolk County, New York, provided that all claims between the parties fall

Actions.</b> The claimant may pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S.\nfederal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Informal

to the complaining party's satisfaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Binding Arbitration.</b> If the parties to the Agreements do not reach a solution through the informal resolution process described in Paragraph 6.3(ii), then any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreements, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\") in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets.\nThe parties agree that the Agreements affect interstate commerce, so the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply and govern the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (notwithstanding the choice of law provision at Subsection 6.1).\nNotwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, the following rules shall apply to any binding arbitration brought under the Agreements:</p>\n</li>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Location and Language.</b> The place of the arbitration shall be Suffolk County, New York and the language shall be English.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Number and Selection of Arbitrators.</b> For any dispute in which the amount in controversy is less than $100,000, there shall be one arbitrator who shall be

arbitration, the second selected by the other party within 30 days of receipt of the request for arbitration, and the third, who shall act as chairperson, selected by the two party-appointed arbitrators within 30 days of the selection of the second arbitrator.\nAny arbitrators not selected within the specified timeframes shall be selected by the AAA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Confidentiality.</b>&nbsp.\nThe existence of the arbitral proceedings and any rulings or awards shall be kept confidential except: (1) if the disclosure is required of a

the preparation of a claim or defense in such arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Modifications.</b>&nbsp.\nIf the Company makes any changes to this Dispute Resolution provision, you may reject any such change by sending the Company written notice within 30 days of the change to the Company's address for Notice, in which case your account and any rights granted to you under the Agreements shall be immediately terminated, without liability to you, and this Dispute Resolution Subsection as in effect immediately prior to the amendment(s) you reject, shall survive.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>6.4 Time Limitations.</b>\nAny claim under the Agreements shall be time-barred unless the claiming party commences arbitration (or litigation if one of the exceptions set forth in Paragraph 6.3(i) applies) with respect to such claim within one year after the basis for such claim became known or should have become known to the claiming party.\nIf

Agreements to any third party.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.6 Amendments.</b>\nThe Company may amend the Agreements from time to time by posting updated Agreements to the Nomorobo Website and/or within the Nomorobo Service.\nYour continued use of the Nomorobo Service after the changes have been made will act as your acceptance of the revised Agreements.\nIf you do not wish to continue to use the Nomorobo Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by following the procedures discussed in Subsections 4.6 or 5.2.</p>\n<p>\nYou acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review the Agreements periodically to maintain awareness of the most current terms of the Agreements.\nThe Company is never required to alert you as to changes to the Agreements, but the Company may choose to do so by any means reasonable under the circumstances (e.g.\nby sending an e-mail or displaying a notice within the Nomorobo Service or on the Nomorobo Website).\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.7 Severability.</b>\nIf any provision or term of the Agreements is deemed invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreements shall remain in full force and effect, except where the construction of the Agreements without the severed provision would materially alter the economic or legal substance of the Agreements in a manner that is materially adverse to the Company, in which case the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify the Agreements so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible.\n&nbsp;To the extent any express or implied restrictions are not permitted by applicable laws, these express or implied restrictions shall remain in force and effect to the maximum extent permitted by such applicable laws.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.8 Merger.</b>\nOther than as stated in this Subsection or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and the Company, the Agreements constitute the final and exclusive agreement between you and the Company.\nThe Agreements supersede all prior negotiations and agreements between you and the Company and there are no other terms or conditions other than those set forth in the Agreements.\nHowever, certain aspects of your use of the Nomorobo Service may be governed by additional agreements (for example, use of a gift card, coupon, or trial account).\nIn those instances, you may be presented with additional terms that you must agree in order to use those aspects.\nIf there is any irreconcilable conflict between those additional terms and the Agreements, the additional terms shall prevail.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.9 Force Majeure.</b>\nAny delay in the performance of any duties or obligations of either party will not be considered a breach of the Agreements if such delay is caused by labor dispute, shortage of materials, earthquake, flood, intervening illegality, or other event beyond the control of such party, provided that such party uses reasonable efforts under the circumstances to notify the other party of the circumstances causing the delay and to resume performance as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.10 Waiver.</b>\nAll waivers must be in writing and the Company's failure to enforce any provision of the Agreements on one or more occasions will not be deemed a waiver.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.11 Notice.</b>\nYou and the Company shall provide only written notices under the Agreements and must use only the acceptable methods and contact information for notice as further discussed below, unless a different method is expressly stated in any Subsection of the Agreements (in which case, that method of delivery is acceptable only for the notice contemplated by the Subsection allowing for that type of notice).\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Notice to You.</b>

defend, indemnify, and hold the Company harmless against any claim that notice was not properly received by you or any individual having a phone line subscribed through your account if the notice was not received because you failed to keep your contact information current or because you failed to disclose notice to other users subscribed through your account.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> If you are not the Primary Account Holder, you understand and agree that you shall be deemed to have received notice of any communication sent to the Primary Account Holder in the same manner and effect as if it were sent directly to you.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Notice to the Company.</b> If you need to provide notice to the Company, you shall provide notice by certified mail, return receipt requested.\nAny such notice should be sent to the Company\u2019s contact information as it is listed on the Nomorobo Website at the time you send the notice and such notice is effective upon receipt
