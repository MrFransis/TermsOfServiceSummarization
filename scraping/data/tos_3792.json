serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online.\nPII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.\nPlease read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear

that visit our blog, website or app? <p>When registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your email address or other details to help you with your experience.\nPostImage does

servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Do we use 'cookies'? <p>Yes.\nCookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.\nFor instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the

experience more efficient, such as user account access, may not function properly.\nHowever, you will still be able to upload images anonymously.</p> Third-party disclosure <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide users with advance notice.\nThis does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential.\nWe may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety.\nHowever, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p> Third-party links <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website.\nThese third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.\nWe therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites.\nNonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p> Google <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles.\nThey are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.\nRead more.</p>\n<p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>\n<p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our

Reporting</li>\n<li>Demographics and Interests Reporting</li>\n<li>DoubleClick Platform Integration</li>\n</ul> We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the

Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics Opt Out Browser add on.\n<p>\n</p> California Online Privacy Protection Act <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.\nThe law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.\nRead more.\nAccording to CalOPPA, we agree to the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>\n<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website.</li>\n<li>Our Privacy

your personal information by emailing us or by logging into your account and visiting your profile page.\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> How does our site handle Do Not Track signals? <p>Due to temporary technical limitations of our website, we do not honor DNT headers at this time.\nHowever we do plan to add support for correct DNT header processing in the future.</p> Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking? <p>We allow third-party behavioral tracking by trusted partners.</p> COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.\nWe do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p> Fair Information Practices <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>\n<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur, we will notify you via email within 7 business days.</p>\n<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-05-27 22:28:43.492765", "updated_at": "2021-05-27 20:29:23.048441"}, {"id":
