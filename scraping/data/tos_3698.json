what's important.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your credentials are safe</strong>\n<br>SaneBox needs access to your Inbox, which means we need your password or OAuth token.\nYour credentials are encrypted with proven public key cryptography, and placed on a server that's unreachable from the public Internet.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your data is completely private</strong>\n<br>SaneBox algorithms analyze the

in order to do that, you have to have a bunch of legalese accompanying your website.\nWe\u2019ve tried to make it easier on you by summing up the bigger paragraphs into small bullet points.\nHere\u2019s the gist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New email still arrives directly to your email server Inbox.\nWhen the SaneBox algorithm determines an email doesn't deserve to be in your Inbox, it is your email server that moves it.\nAt all times, during this process, your email server maintains possession of your email just like it always has.</li>\n<li>Your data is completely private.\nSaneBox algorithms analyze the patterns in your email behavior (which emails you open, which emails you respond to, how quickly, etc) to determine what\u2019s important to you.\nOur robots never look at the content of your emails except when you choose optional features like Sane Attachments that require us to change that content.\nAnd our employees never ever look at the content.</li>\n<li>We are really good guys so if you need anything, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to support@sanebox.com</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>By signing up for SaneBox, you understand and accept the following terms of service.</p>\n<p>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (\u201cTOS\u201d) SET FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH SANEBOX MAKES AVAILABLE ITS PROPRIETARY EMAIL INBOX ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE OFFERING (\u201cSERVICE\u201d).\nBY SIGNING UP FOR THE SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THESE TOS.\nREFERENCES IN THESE TOS TO \u201cYOU\u201d OR TO \u201cUSERS\u201d ARE REFERENCES TO YOU, THE PERSON OR ENTITY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE.\nIF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TOS ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THESE TOS WILL CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN SANEBOX AND SUCH ENTITY AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THE TOS.</p>\n<p>If you enjoy SaneBox after your free two-week trial, paid subscription plans are available to fit your needs.\nOtherwise, you can cancel at any time.</p>\n<p>Also, you must be at least 13 years old to use SaneBox.\n</p>\n<p>Your use of the Service is expressly conditioned on your continued payment of the subscription fees applicable to the Service as set forth at www.\nSaneBox.com (the \u201cSite\u201d) and your acceptance of and continued compliance with these TOS.\nThis Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old or possess legal parental or guardian consent.\nIf you do not so qualify, do not attempt to use the Service.\nSaneBox may refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity at any time and may change its eligibility criteria, at any time, in its sole discretion.</p>\n<p>We may need to alter these TOS.\nThe revised TOS will be posted here at least 30 days before any changes take effect.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that SaneBox may revise these TOS at any time [by posting an updated version of these TOS on the Site at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of any such revisions.\nIf you do not agree to any revisions to these TOS, you may terminate these TOS by notifying SaneBox in writing prior to such revisions becoming effective and SaneBox will promptly refund any amounts paid for the unused portion of the Service.] By continuing to access or use the Service after SaneBox makes any such revisions, you agree to be bound by the revised TOS.</p>\n<p>SaneBox isn\u2019t a spam filter or virus scanner \u2013 we don\u2019t look at the body of your emails or any of the information contained inside.\nIt\u2019s up to you to decide whether or not an email is safe to open.</p>\n<p>\n<b>SaneBox is not a spam filter and does not scan for viruses or potentially unsafe messages.</b> The SaneBox algorithms intuit the importance of an email via various mechanisms.\nNone of these mechanisms involves analyzing the body of the email so <b>it is left up to the user to make the final determination about the authenticity and safety of each email.</b> We strongly, strongly recommend that users never ever click on a link in an email.\nAll links are suspect and should be dealt with extreme caution.\nThe only safe way to interact with an email is to copy the link into a browser and see that the domain in the link is the domain of the business or person you know.\nPlease be careful out there.</p>\n<p>SaneBox places non-urgent emails into SaneLater, a folder you can sort through at your leisure.\nYou can check this folder manually or receive our daily digest to see what we moved.\nWe aren\u2019t responsible for any consequences related to a delay in you seeing an email.</p>\n<p>\n<b>SaneBox assumes that email is not meant to be a realtime medium of communication.</b> For instance, no one sane would ever send an email to request an ambulance.\nSaneBox puts emails into your SaneLater folder based on our prediction of what we think should be important.\nSaneBox is not responsible for any consequences related to the delay between the time a user receives their non-Inbox email and the time they read and process it.\nSaneBox is also not responsible for any consequences that may occur if the user incorrectly trains an email into their BlackHole folder causing emails of that type to be automatically filed into their Trash folder.\nSaneBox strongly, strongly recommend that users sign up to receive our email summary digest several times during the work day to enable them to stay on top of these \u201cunimportant\u201d emails and their most recent trainings.\nYou can do this at https://www.sanebox.com/dashboard/settings.\nOnce you sign up, you get an email summary digest once a day.</p>Privacy Policy<p>SaneBox respects the privacy of its users and follows the privacy guidelines defined in our Privacy Policy, which is available at <b>Privacy Policy</b> and hereby incorporated into these TOS.</p>Accuracy and Security<p>We\u2019ve been at this a long time, and security is our top priority.</p>\n<p>We seek to maintain reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse or unauthorized access of the personally identifying information under our control.\nUnfortunately, there is no such thing as perfect security.\nAs a result, although we strive to protect personally identifying information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted through or stored on the Site or the Service (including any computers, servers, storage devices or other computer or telecommunications infrastructure used in providing the Service, whether owned or operated by us or any third party).</p>\n<p>On our end, we try our absolute best to protect against the loss or misuse of personal information, yet no system is perfect.\nIn the unlikely event of a security breach, we have procedures in place to deal with the breach.</p>\n<p>We strive to take reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information collected from our website visitors.\nAny personal information we retain under our control is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible to authorized employees.\nWe also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access of the information under our control.\nFor example, before we allow account holders to access their personal information, we verify their identity by requesting information such as their Sign-in ID and password.\nIn the event of a security breach, we have procedures in place to protect our consumers\u2019 data.</p>\n<p>On your end, <b>keep your password safe and don\u2019t share your account information with anyone.</b> You know the drill.</p>\n<p>SaneBox account holders agree to keep their Sign-in IDs and passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access and use of their accounts.\nIf you are a SaneBox account holder and have set your \u201cAuto Sign-in\u201d setting to populate your password and Sign-in ID automatically, please make sure you change the setting to [Auto Sign-in Off] before you let anyone else use your account or give your device to anyone else.\nYou are responsible for all use of the Service under your account.</p>\n<p>We use 3rd party subscription providers to handle financial transactions.\nWhile these are fine institutions, we do not represent them and take no responsibility for how they handle their security.</p>\n<p>We have engaged 3rd party subscription providers to handle all aspects of your financial transactions involved with purchasing the SaneBox products.\nWe do not represent and/or warrant the security or anything else regarding their systems.\nIf you wish to review their security setup you can do that here: pay.amazon.com/, apple.com/apple-pay/, paypal.com, and stripe.com.</p>Use of the Site and Service<p>We reserve the right to revoke access to SaneBox at any time if you break the TOS.\nWe may also revoke access at our discretion by giving you 30 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p>Revocation means you won\u2019t be able to use SaneBox, but your email account will still be 100% accessible.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that SaneBox may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or any folders within the Service) to you at SaneBox\u2019s sole discretion, without prior notice to you, if you breach these TOS.\nIn addition, SaneBox may terminate these TOS and your right to access and use the Service for any reason or no reason by giving thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice to you.\nIf we terminate the Service or these TOS for any reason other than your breach of the TOS or of any other contractual obligation to us, we will provide a refund of any amounts paid for the unused portion of the Service.\nYou acknowledge and agree that if SaneBox disables access to your account, you will be prevented from using the Service and you may not be able to access information associated with your SaneBox account.\nHowever, any suspension or termination of the Service will not affect your ability to access your email account.</p>\n<p>You do not have the right to use any SaneBox trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand folders.\n</p>\n<p>These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the SaneBox trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand folders.\nNo license to any software is granted hereunder.\nOther than the right to access and use the Service

applicable to your use of those sites.\nYou should contact the site administrator or webmaster for those External Sites if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on such External Sites.</p>\n<p>We love feedback! We are always trying to improve.\nIf you send feedback, you are giving us permission to use it how we please.</p>\n<p>At your discretion, you may provide feedback to SaneBox concerning the functionality and performance of the Service from time to time, including, without limitation, identifying potential errors, improvements, modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements (\u201cFeedback\u201d).\nWhile we appreciate it when users send us Feedback, please be aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post via social media or other

of the above, including intellectual property rights infringement and security-related issues, to the fullest extent of the law.\nSaneBox may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate these TOS.\nYou acknowledge that SaneBox has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the SaneBox\u2019s services, but has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Service, to ensure your compliance with these TOS, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body.</p>\n<p>We take GDPR very seriously.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as of May 25, 2018, you agree that if you are a legal entity, then at any time when you have not accepted the SaneBox Data Processing Addendum (or when it is not in full force and effect for any other reason), you will be prohibited from Processing Client Personal Data regulated by EU Data Protection Laws (all capitalized references shall have the meaning defined in the said Addendum), and shall be obligated to immediately cease and desist from any such Processing, for as long as the said Addendum is not in full force and effect.\nThis restriction does not apply if you are an individual.\nIf you are a legal entity, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless SaneBox and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors, and permitted assigns against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of

legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services, or your violation of these TOS.</p>Limitation of Liability<p>We are limiting any legal liability we have to you.</p>\n<p>SANEBOXTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTENT OF ITS USERS\u2019 DATA.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SANEBOX BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TOS OR FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR ANY USER INFORMATION SENT THROUGH, STORED BY OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT SANEBOX HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SANEBOX WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR

JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>Severability<p>In the event that any provision of these TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the TOS will remain in full force and affect.</p>Waiver<p>Almost every online Terms of Service page contains these three passages.\nBasically, we\u2019re just reiterating what we said earlier and tying up any loose ends.</p>\n<p>The failure of SaneBox to enforce any right or provision of these TOS will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.\nAny waiver by SaneBox of any provision of these TOS must be in writing, signed by an authorized representative of SaneBox.</p>Controlling Law and Jurisdiction<p>These TOS and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction

services, affiliate services or third-party content software or services.</p>Trademarks<p>SANEBOX is registered trademark of SaneBox, Inc..</p>You Should Have Backups<p>SaneBox doesn\u2019t send or receive mail.\nWe monitor your email account and ask your email server to move non-urgent emails to a Sane folder.\n<b>At no point do we take possession of the email.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Therefore, we are not responsible for your email in any way.\nNo software is perfect, so we assume you have backed up your email accounts and have taken the proper precautions to ensure they are safe.</p>\n<p>SaneBox does not participate in sending or receiving your email.\nWe simply monitor your Inbox and when we see an email that is not Inbox-worthy, we ask your email server to move it to one of your Sane folders.\nEmail messages that are processed by the Service are resident on your server and it is your email server that takes all actions on your email.\nThe User, and not SaneBox, is responsible for maintaining appropriate backups of the email accounts used in connection with the Service.</p>\n<p>Software will never be perfect.\nNeither your email client, nor your desktop computer or mobile device, nor your email server, nor SaneBox will ever be perfect.\nYou have all had glitches from time to time with every computerized service and device you own.\nThat is why you should all have your work backed up.\nYou should have your email backed up.\nYou should have your computer backed up.\nYou should have your mobile device backed up.\nSaneBox assumes you are doing the common sense thing of doing simple backups for all that stuff.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t do backups for you.\nWe don\u2019t have physical possession of your email.\nIt is all on your email server.\nIf your email server or client or computer has a glitch, you should go to your backups to recover whatever file, email, or corrupted piece of software that you lost.\nHopefully, you have been backing all that stuff up for years, but you must know this already.</p>Refunds<p>If you are not happy with our service, we hope you\u2019ll tell us.\nWe will try to fix anything about SaneBox that doesn\u2019t leave you completely thrilled.\nIf we can\u2019t, we will cheerfully refund the amount within 30 days of purchase.</p>Store Credit<p>SaneBox store credit is only redeemable for SaneBox subscriptions.\nSaneBox store credit is an incentive for our active customers to remain active.\nAny outstanding store credit will be cleared either when the you cancel your account or when your account is cancelled due to inactivity.</p>Email<p>We obviously take SPAM very seriously.\nSaneBox is fully compliant with CAN-SPAM.</p>\n<p>\n<i>These TOS were last modified January 6, 2021.</i>\n</p>

protect your privacy and provide you with a great service.</p>The Data We Collect<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed in the Service, which typically includes email headers along with any personal data contained in those email headers.\nAs a result, it is not possible to list all types of personal data that may be processed.\nHowever, we typically process:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>biographical data (such as first name and last name);</li>\n<li>contact data (such as email address);</li>\n<li>for third party integrations (e.g., Google Mail) we may have to store authorization credentials and related data for other sites;</li>\n<li>comments you make in our forums or elsewhere on our website, which could include any category of personal data.\nand</li>\n<li>any other type of data we may ask you or that you may choose to provide us with.</li>\n</ul>Controllership <p>When you use the SaneBox service as an agent (e.g., an employee) of an organization, your organization is the data controller, and SaneBox is a data processor for the personal data we process for you in our Service.</p>\n<p>And when you use the SaneBox service as an individual, SaneBox is the data controller.\nLegal jargon aside, our goal is to ensure that you, as a SaneBox user, are in control of how your data is processed in our Service.\n</p>Basis of Processing<p>Where SaneBox acts as a data controller, we rely on one or more of the following legal grounds for processing your personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the need to perform our obligations under a contract or to perform related pre-contractual duties;</li>\n<li>any other ground, as required or permitted by law in the specific respective context.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When SaneBox acts as a data

on SaneBox servers.\nSaneBox simply monitors the customers SaneBox related email folders and asks the email server to move emails accordingly.</p>\n<p>We log and keep information on active accounts about email movement and behavior in order to debug any current issues customers may report.\nBut, we securely remove those email activity logs older than 30 days</p>\n<p>We securely remove customer data (that can be regenerated) from inactive accounts after 90 days.\nThis includes any cached information about emails that did reside in the customers email server folders that SaneBox monitors.</p>\n<p>We \"cancel\" accounts that have no billing relationship and have been inactive for 6 months.\nThe customers are warned about once a month that this cancelation is pending and given directions for how to activate their accounts to avoid it.</p>Permissions needed for SaneBox to work<p>We are required to obtain certain permissions&nbsp.\nin order for SaneBox to function.\nIf we could ask for less, we certainly would.</p>Cookies<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website or app stores on your computer or mobile device.\nWe use the following types of

the envelope and header data associated with your emails.\nThe actual body of your emails (i.e., the contents of the email message) are never downloaded or accessed by our systems.</p>\n<p>When you cancel your SaneBox membership, we not only securely delete all data on our servers associated with your mail account but we also delete any labels or flags we might have created - so not only will we no longer have any of your data on our servers, but also your email inbox will look exactly like it did before you signed up with us.</p>\n<p>If for any reason, SaneBox, Inc.\ndecides to discontinue the SaneBox Service, all users will be contacted by email and their account data will be securely deleted from our servers in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>And remember that we will only backup metadata -
