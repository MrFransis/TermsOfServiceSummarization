Download Form PDF <ol>\n<li>Scope, right to amend, definitions <ol>\n<li>memail is a service provided by MeMail AG, Friedrichstr.\n90, 10117 Berlin (hereinafter: \"memail\").</li>\n<li>For all agreements concluded between memail and memail\u2019s customers (hereinafter: \"Users\") which refer to these General Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs) in relation to the use of the memail services, the following provisions apply exclusively.\nAny conflicting terms of business of the User shall not form part of the contractual agreement unless memail has expressly agreed to them in writing.\nThis applies equally to services provided by memail for payment and those provided free of charge.\n</li>\n<li>memail is entitled to alter or amend these T&amp;Cs to the extent this seems necessary and provided the users involved are not consequently disadvantaged in a manner contrary to the principles of good faith.\nThese T&amp;Cs can also be amended as a reaction to new technical developments, changes to case law, the legal situation or other equivalent reasons.\nUsers will be notified in text form in advance of any amendments to the T&amp;Cs.\nAny amendments which considerably disrupt the contractual balance between the parties require the express consent of the User.\nOtherwise, such amendments will be deemed to have been accepted if the User does not object in text form within six weeks of receipt of the notification.\nmemail will expressly advise the User of this consequence and the consequences mentioned below within the notification of the changes.\nIn the event of an objection, memail is entitled to restrict the use of the account while allowing access to the already existing data (restricted to access to emails sent and received up to that point) and to terminate any agreements concerning services provided free-of-charge services concluded with application of the T&amp;Cs prior to their amendment, by giving two weeks\u2019 notice.\nIn the event of an objection to the new T&amp;Cs, memail will be entitled to an extraordinary right of termination to the extent that memail cannot reasonably be expected to remain a party to the agreement, taking into account the interests of memail and of the User, in particular if memail or the User would, were the contractual relationship to be continued under the previous T&amp;Cs, be in violation of applicable statutory provisions.\n</li>\n<li>The User is a \"consumer\", to the extent the purpose of the use of memail\u2019s services cannot be attributed predominantly to the User\u2019s commercial or self-employed activities.\nA \"Business Entity\" on the other hand is a natural or legal person or a private company with legal capacity, which is acting, when concluding the agreement, in the scope of carrying on its commercial or self-employed activities.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Subject matter <ol>\n<li>memail is a provider of email services (email addresses and email storage).\nDetails on the various services and their scope can be found in the respective product and service specifications.</li>\n<li>Agreements relate to individual services, unless several services are expressly offered as a package.\nWhere services are added to already existing services (e.g.\nadditional email storage) there will generally be independent agreements to cover those additional services.</li>\n<li>These T&amp;Cs apply to all contractual agreements concluded between memail and the User, including the registration and use of memail without the conclusion of any agreements subject to payment, which have to be accepted in the course of the respective registration or order process.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Requirements for using memail.\nadding signatures to emails <ol>\n<li>memail services may be used by persons who are at least 16 years of age.\nFor minors, who have not yet reached 18 years of age, prior consent is required from a parent or legal guardian.\n</li>\n<li>The offer of free of charge email services (email address and/or email storage space) is limited to one free of charge package per natural person.</li>\n<li>With regard to free of charge email services, memail is entitled to add an automated reference to memail to the User\u2019s incoming and outgoing emails within a signature.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Registration, verification and login details <ol>\n<li>Use of the service requires prior registration, in which the user sets a username and password (login details).\nRegistering with memail is possible without verification, however the use of the services requires additional verification (double opt-in process via email or mobile phone number).\nA password reset (\"Forgot password?\") is only possible where the user has provided verification details beforehand, hence verification is generally recommended.</li>\n<li>Passwords for the account and for individual services must not be shared with third parties.\nThe User undertakes to keep them strictly confidential and protect them from third parties.\nThe User must immediately change any passwords as soon as there is any indication that unauthorized third parties have or could have obtained knowledge of login details.\nAll passwords should be changed regularly.</li>\n<li>The use of chargeable services requires the User\u2019s contractually relevant information (first name and surname, address, payment details etc.).\nThe User undertakes to provide truthful information and warrants that all contractually relevant information (in particular first name and surname, address and payment information) is correct.\nIn addition, the User is obliged to keep this information up to date in their memail \"Dashboard\".</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Conclusion of agreement <ol>\n<li>The information presented on memail\u2019s website regarding the services does not constitute a legally binding offer for the conclusion of an agreement.\nInstead, these are non-binding invitations to the User to submit a binding offer to conclude an agreement.</li>\n<li>The User can place the services they want to conclude a contract for in the virtual shopping cart.\nIn that shopping cart, the user can change and correct the selection at any time prior to placing a binding order by using the editing tools provided and explained in the order process.</li>\n<li>By clicking on \"Place order\" (or similar), the user submits a binding offer to conclude an agreement regarding the service or services which are in their shopping cart at that time.\nThe User will subsequently receive a confirmation of receipt from memail, in which the User is provided with the details on their order, the T&amp;Cs, notice on right of cancellation/revocation and data protection policy in text form.\nThis confirmation of receipt does not yet constitute a declaration of acceptance from memail, unless the confirmation of receipt is expressly linked with such a declaration.</li>\n<li>The agreement is only deemed to have been confirmed with an express declaration of acceptance from memail, with the first act of fulfilment by memail, i.e.\nwith the provision of the ordered service for use by the User or with the collection of the fees for the ordered services.\n</li>\n<li>The text of the agreement will be communicated to the User during the order process in text form and will be stored by memail.\nFurthermore, the user can find information as to the details of the agreement concluded (services ordered, term, notice periods etc.) in the \"Dashboard\"</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Right of cancellation/revocation and cancellation/revocation form <ol>\n<li>If the User is a consumer, they have a statutory right of cancellation/revocation.\nDetails on the right of cancellation/revocation and the consequences of cancellation/revocation, as well as a template cancellation/revocation form can be found here: https://www.memail.com/privacy#cancelPolicy.\nThe user will be advised of this option in text form during the ordering process as well as again following the placement of an order.\n<i>\n</i> Download Form PDF </li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Selection of email addresses (preferred names) and use of email services <ol>\n<li>The User may use the email address provided to them by memail to send and receive emails, provided the email address and the use thereof is in accordance with sections 7.2 to 7.4 below.\nThe User shall, for the duration of the agreement, be the exclusive authorized user of the email address.</li>\n<li>The User undertakes not to register and/or use any preferred names/aliases, as part of any email addresses, which contain discriminatory, racist, sexist, offensive or defamatory elements or elements which glorify violence or otherwise violate good morals.\nIn addition, the desired names/aliases may not violate any third-party rights (e.g.\nmoral rights, name rights, trade mark rights).\nThe name/alias may not contain terms which are typically used as email addresses for internet sites (e.g.\nsupport@, service@, info@ etc.).\nmemail reserves the right to reject individual names/aliases and to request that the user chooses a different name/alias.</li>\n<li>The User undertakes not to send any content which violates statutory provisions, good morals and/or third-party rights via email accounts provided by memail.\nIn particular, the User is prohibited from sending content which is discriminatory, racist, sexist, offensive or defamatory or which glorifies violence.\nSimilarly, the User is prohibited from using the email accounts provided by memail to illegally harass others.\n</li>\n<li>The User is obliged not to use memail accounts to send unlawful, unsolicited marketing emails in violation of provisions under competition law and/or data protection law.</li>\n<li>The User releases memail from all third-party claims which may be brought against memail in relation to breaches of the preceding sections.\nIn addition, memail is entitled, in the event of breaches of sections 7.2 to 7.4 above, to block the services in question and terminate the agreement without notice.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Prices, due dates, payment and arrears <ol>\n<li>Details concerning amounts to be paid and payment conditions can be found on the respective, current offer pages or, in the case of renewals, from the price information provided.\nThe amounts to be paid are subject to currency fluctuations.\nthe relevant date shall be the date of booking on the offer pages or, in the case of renewals, the price information provided.</li>\n<li>The prices stated are, for users within the European Union, gross prices including the respectively applicable value added tax.\nFor users outside of the EU, the prices are stated exclusive of value added tax.\nValue added tax will be applied as per the stated country in the billing address which must correspond to the User\u2019s actual location.</li>\n<li>Any discounts will always initially be applied to the respective net amount and value added tax applied thereafter.</li>\n<li>Payments shall be due on the day of provision of the ordered service to be used by the User.\nPayments shall be made using the payment method selected by the User.\nThe same applies for payments to renew agreements.</li>\n<li>If the payment of fees for newly created services (not for renewals.\nfor renewals see section 10) via the selected payment method fails (\"Payment Failure\"), the order shall be deemed cancelled.\nThe User may then resubmit the order.\n</li>\n<li>If, following a successful payment, the User reverses/recalls the payment at a later date, after memail has already begun providing the service in accordance with section 9.2 (\"Payment Recall\"), the agreement shall remain in force and the user shall remain obliged to pay the amount due.\nIn such an event, memail shall be entitled to block the service until such time as the amount due has been paid.</li>\n<li>The User shall automatically be deemed to be in arrears, irrespective of any reminder sent, if the collection of the amount due, using the payment method specified by the User, fails and the amount is not paid within 14 days of the User being informed thereof.\nIn the event of the User falling into arrears, memail is entitled to charge interest at the level of 5 percentage points above the base rate applicable at the time.\nIf the User is not a consumer, memail is entitled to charge interest at the level of 9 percentage points above the base rate.\nmemail reserves the right to assert claims for damages in addition.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Term, Renewal, Termination <ol>\n<li>Agreements subject to payment are concluded on an indefinite basis, for the term stated on the offer pages followed by automatic renewals for the duration in each case of the term last selected by the User.\nAgreements with a time limit will end automatically at the end of the term unless renewed by the User.</li>\n<li>The relevant date for the commencement of an agreement is the date on which memail makes the ordered service available for use by the User.</li>\n<li>Agreements concerning free of charge services will, unless otherwise agreed or agreed during the term thereof, be concluded for the term stated on the offer pages and will end automatically upon expiry thereof, without there being any need for express termination.\nThe user can, however, transfer the account to a paid service, under the terms and conditions applicable at the time of booking this paid service.</li>\n<li>memail is entitled to terminate an agreement for free of charge provision of email services after a period of 90 days of inactivity of the User.\nInactivity means that the User has not logged in to their account using the login details.\nmemail will notify the User of such termination by email prior to the expiry of that 90-day time period.\nThe User will be advised of the consequences of the termination of the agreement (section 10).\n</li>\n<li>Agreements concerning chargeable services with a minimum term will renew automatically for a period equal to that minimum term (but no more than one year) unless the agreement is terminated giving one month\u2019s notice prior to expiry of the minimum term.\n</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the right of termination in text form, the User can activate and deactivate automatic renewal of the agreement in their \"Dashboard\".\nA deactivation of a previously activated automatic renewal will be deemed termination effective the end of the current contractual term where the deactivation occurs within the notice period and the automatic renewal remains deactivated beyond the respective end of the period.\nIf deactivation occurs after expiry of the notice period, the agreement will end at the expiry of the following term, unless automatic renewal is reactivated before then.</li>\n<li> The right of the User and of memail to terminate the agreement without notice for good cause remains unaffected.\nmemail is, in particular, entitled to termination without notice if <ul>\n<li>the User breaches their obligations under sections 7.2 to 7.4;</li>\n<li>the contractually relevant information is false, in violation of section 4.3;</li>\n<li>the User falls into arrears with payments of the due amounts by more than 60 days;</li>\n<li>memail is no longer able to provide the service in relation to the domain in question on factual or legal grounds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The User can delete their user account in the \"Dashboard\".\nWhere paid services attached to a user account are still active, these will end upon deletion of that account.\nthe User remains obliged, however, to pay the relevant price for the previously booked services until the date on which they are contractually due to expire.\nUpon deletion of the account, the data stored in relation to that account will be deleted in accordance with section 10.4.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Consequences of Termination, Payment Failure or Payment Recall <ol>\n<li>In the case of an active termination of a service by the User (i.e.\nin text form or in the \"Dashboard\" area) or by memail, any data of the User stored in relation to the terminated service (emails, contact details, address books etc.) will be deleted unless a statutory obligation for continued retention thereof exists.\nIn the event of the termination of email storage space, this means, in particular, that all emails will also be deleted.\nIn the event of the termination of the entire email account, the deletion will include all contact details, address books etc.\nTerminated email addresses can be reissued by memail to third parties after a period for consideration of 14 days subsequent to the termination coming into effect.</li>\n<li>If the agreement ends in regard to a service as a result of a renewal not occurring, i.e.\nwithout active termination on the part of the User within the meaning of section 10.1 above (\"Expiry\"), or <ul>\n<li>in the case of Payment Failure (section 8.5) concerning a renewal or</li>\n<li>in the case of Payment Recall (section 8.6),</li>\n</ul> memail will initially block the User\u2019s access to the respective service.\nThe User will be given an opportunity, within 60 days of Expiry of the agreement or the date of Payment Failure or Payment Recall respectively (\"Grace Period\"), to subsequently renew the agreement or effect payment of the amount due (\"Corrective Action\"), and thereby retain the data stored in relation to the service (e.g.\nemails, address books etc.).\n30 days after the start of the Grace Period, memail is entitled to charge an additional fee, the amount of which is stated in the recovery process.\nIf in the case of Expiry the subsequent renewal or in the case of Payment Failure or Payment Recall the payment of the amount due is not effected within the Grace Period, memail will delete the data related to the expired service as set out in section 10.1, unless a statutory obligation for continued retention thereof exists.\nMemail is then entitled to reissue the email addresses belonging to the expired service to third parties.</li>\n<li>In the case of a Corrective Action in the meaning of section 10.2, the term of agreement commences: <ul>\n<li>in the case of Expiry: the day following the date of expiry of the original agreement;</li>\n<li>in case of Payment Failure (section 8.3) concerning a renewal or a Payment Recall (section 8.4): the original date of the commencement of the services, which the Payment Failure or Payment Recall related to.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the aforementioned subsections of section 10, the User may request the immediate deletion of the entire service including any data stored in relation to it, whereupon the account and all data stored in it will be deleted.\nThis shall not apply where memail has a statutory obligation to retain data.\nAn immediate deletion of the data, subject to any aforementioned statutory duty of retention, will also be undertaken in the event of a deletion of the user account by the User.</li>\n<li>If the ending of the agreement concerns storage space for storing emails and if the ending of the agreement with the retention of the email account results in a reduction of the storage space available to the User (\"downgrade\"), the User will still be able to read the stored emails for a period of 30 days, however will not be able to send or receive any new emails until they have deleted sufficient data to be within the new email storage volume.\nIf the reduction in the volume of stored data is not effected within 30 days, memail is entitled to terminate the agreement concerning the email account.</li>\n<li>If the User effects a termination without notice, sections 10.1 shall apply accordingly.\nIf memail effects a termination without notice, memail will not delete the stored data of the User related to the terminated service (emails, contact details, address books etc.) for a period of 30 days or, in the event of a dispute with the User concerning the ending of the agreement, until such time as the dispute has been finally resolved, unless the User insists that memail immediately delete the data.\nmemail shall, however, not delete the data where memail has a statutory obligation to retain data.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Liability <ol>\n<li>memail has unlimited liability towards the User in the case of intent and gross negligence, in the case of a lack of a guaranteed feature as well as in the case of injury to life, limb or health.</li>\n<li>In the case of simple negligence, memail shall be liable, provided there has been no injury to life, limb or health, only in respect of damage or loss resulting from a not insignificant breach of a material contractual obligation.\nA material contractual obligation is an obligation which must be fulfilled to enable the due and proper performance of the contractual agreement, the violation of which jeopardizes the achievement of the purpose of the agreement and the observance of which the User is normally entitled to rely on.\nIn this case, the liability is limited, however, to compensation for damage or loss which can typically be foreseen in this type of agreement.</li>\n<li>The limitations of liability which follow from the preceding sections also apply to breaches of obligations by or to the benefit of persons, for whose actions memail bears responsibility under the relevant statutory provisions.\nThey do not apply in cases where memail has maliciously concealed a defect or has provided a guarantee for the quality of the services, and also not to claims according to the German Product Liability Act (Produkthaftungsgesetz, ProdHaftG).</li>\n<li>Otherwise, liability for all other damage or loss is excluded.</li>\n<li>The User is responsible for creating, at regular intervals, local backups of incoming and outgoing email correspondence on their own system.\nA liability on the part of memail for loss of data will be limited to the cost and effort required to recover data lost by memail from the User\u2019s backups on the User\u2019s own system.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Data Protection <ol>\n<li>Detailed information on data protection can be found at: https://www.memail.com/privacy.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Availability of the services.\nprotection against viruses, spam, malware etc.\n<ol>\n<li>memail guarantees an average annual availability of the service of 99%.\nOutages for which memail is not responsible, in particular those due to technical disruptions caused by third parties or force majeure, are excluded.\nThe same applies if memail has to restrict the services in defense against third-party interference (e.g.\nhacker attacks).</li>\n<li>memail uses technological measures to protect users against viruses, trojans, spam, malware, etc.\nHowever, we would note that no protection software available on the market can provide 100% security.\nIt therefore cannot be ruled out that even emails which have been checked by memail may contain malicious content or attachments.\nIt is therefore the User's responsibility to check emails and attachments in particular, despite memail\u2019s use of the protection programs.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Online dispute resolution and consumer arbitration board <ol>\n<li>The European Commission platform for online dispute resolution (ODR), can be found here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.</li>\n<li>memail is neither obliged under the law nor willing to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Final Provisions <ol>\n<li>The contractual language is English.</li>\n<li>The User may only transfer the rights and obligations under this agreement to third parties after prior consent from memail in text form.</li>\n<li>The legal relationship between the contracting partners is governed exclusively by German law with the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\nThe statutory provisions on the limitation of the choice of law and on the applicability of mandatory provisions, in particular of the country in which the User, as a consumer, has their usual residence, remain unaffected.</li>\n<li>Insofar as the User is a businessperson, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes based on the contractual relationships between memail and the User is Berlin.</li>\n<li>Even in the event of individual points in this agreement being legally invalid, the remaining parts of the agreement shall remain binding.\nThe invalid points shall be replaced by the relevant statutory provisions.\nInsofar as this would represent an unreasonable hardship for one of the contracting parties, the agreement shall be deemed invalid in full.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Berlin, 19 February 2020</p> memail Affiliate Program Terms

prior to the sending of such email communications and whether the statutory requirements for such email communication are met.</li>\n<li>Affiliate must remove Advertising Materials from the Advertising Sites without delay if memail requests this</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Prohibited acts <ol>\n<li>Affiliate may not misuse the Advertising Materials, AffiliateID or the mAP nor manipulate the mAP or the associated data collection and processing.\nIn particular, all forms of \"affiliate fraud\" (cookie spamming, forced clicks, affiliate hopping etc.) are prohibited.</li>\n<li>No attempts may be made, alone or with the help of third parties, to generate sales using abusive practices.</li>\n<li>The transmission or use of \"interstitials\", \"parasiteware\", \"parasitic marketing\", \"shopping assistance applications\", \"toolbar installations and/or addons\", \"shopping wallets\" or \"deceptive popups\" and/or \"pop-unders\", in the time between when the Advertising Materials which lead to memail are clicked on and the memail website is completely left, is prohibited.\n\"Parasitic marketing\" means, in particular, the use of applications which <ul>\n<li>inadvertently or intentionally overwrite the tracking cookies for the affiliate marketing without the visitor first having actively clicked a link within the Advertising Materials;</li>\n<li>intercept search requests in order to divert the data traffic and thus display popups or set or overwrite tracking cookies, whereby a visitor would, under normal circumstances have arrived at the same destination using the search results displayed by the usual search engines;</li>\n<li>set tracking cookies by displaying the memail website in iFrames, set hidden links or generate automatic popups which open the memail website;</li>\n<li>lead to text on websites which do not completely belong to the owner of the application in order to thus carry out context-related marketing;</li>\n<li>prevent, remove or replace advertising banners.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The use of the signs \"memail\", \"memail.com\" or \"www.memail.com\" including misspellings or other variations in the scope of pay-per-click campaigns as keywords in keyword marketing is not permitted.</li>\n<li>Affiliate undertakes not to make any attempt to override, circumvent or otherwise disable any security measures employed by memail or the mAP tracking system.\nIn addition, Affiliate undertakes not to damage the memail system by way of electronic attacks (viruses, worms, trojans, brute-force attacks, spam etc.).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Landing pages and AffiliateID <ol>\n<li>memail will give Affiliate the opportunity to set up a landing page which can be personalized by Affiliate using texts, photographs, images, videos etc.\n(\"<strong>Landing Page Content</strong>\")</li>\n<li>As far as the design of the landing page and the Landing Page Content is concerned, sections 4.2, 4.3 and 5 apply accordingly.\nmemail is entitled to remove Landing Page Content or to block a landing page entirely in the event that indications exists that they violate sections 4.2, 4.3 or 5 and/or in the even that third parties demand that memail remove content.</li>\n<li>The AffiliateID provided to the user, which is at the same time part of the internet address of the landing page (e.g.\nmemail.com/myID), may be personalized by the user.\nIt must not infringe any third party rights (in particular no trade mark or other designation rights) and must not contain any of the content set out in section 4.2.\nmemail is entitled to block the AffiliateID if indications exist that it infringes third party rights or contains content set out in section 4.2.\nThe AffiliateID may not be based on system sub-directories of memail nor contain terms which are typically used as names of sub-directories for internet sites (e.g.\norder, signup, register etc.).\nmemail reserves the right to reject individual AffiliateIDs and to request that the user chooses a different AffiliateID.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Violations of sections 4, 5, and 6.\nright of indemnity <ol>\n<li>In the event that Affiliate violates one of the obligations arising from sections 4, 5 and 6 above, this shall constitute direct grounds for immediate termination of the contractual agreement by memail.\nIn cases of suspicion, memail is also entitled to block Affiliate\u2019s mAP account.</li>\n<li>Affiliate hereby indemnifies memail as well as employees and representatives of memail from all claims of and loss or damage suffered by third parties which can be attributed to a violation of the obligations arising from sections 4, 5 and 6.\nMoreover, Affiliate shall reimburse memail all costs which memail, its employees or representatives incur as a result of third party action taken against them.\nThis shall also include reimbursement of costs for due and proper legal defense against such claims.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Rights of use <ol>\n<li> memail hereby grants Affiliate a non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to reproduce, distribute and publish the Advertising Materials as well as memail signs, MEMAIL and the memail logos, solely in the scope of this agreement and for the duration of the participation in the mAP.\nAny use beyond that, in particular use without any connection to the mAP, is generally not permitted.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Commission <ol>\n<li>In order to record (\"<strong>track</strong>\") the Referrals as relevant for the calculation of the commission, the Advertising Materials made available by memail and the AffiliateID must be used as described in the AAM.\nOtherwise, no commission can be attributed.</li>\n<li>Affiliate will receive a commission payment from memail dependent on successful sales and based on the following requirements: <ul>\n<li>A sale with a third party is completed (conclusion of contract for paid services as per memail T&amp;Cs), which can be attributed to the Referral by Affiliate.\nand</li>\n<li>the sale as well as the related Referral have been tracked by memail via cookies.\nand</li>\n<li>the acquired third party has paid in full for the service ordered, has not cancelled/revoked the declaration of conclusion of the sale within the cancellation/revocation period and has not later cancelled the sale;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A proper tracking of the Referral requires that both Affiliate and the acquired customer allow memail to store and read out cookies on their respective end devices and that the cookies set by memail are not deleted up to the time of settlement of the commission.\nMemail has no influence over this.\nIn the event that Referrals are not properly tracked due to the blocking of cookies or that the cookies are deleted, there will be no right to commission.</li>\n<li>If the acquired third party does not pay for the services ordered, cancels/revokes the agreement or cancels the payment after it has been made (\"<strong>Rescission of Contract</strong>\"), no commission will be due.\nRescissions of Contract which occur later than eight weeks after payment by the acquired third party will have no influence on the commission becoming due.</li>\n<li>The amount of the commission is dependent on the product and the volume of the sale.\nThe details can be found in the AAM.\nThe conditions which can be viewed there, as amended from time to time, apply.\nmemail reserves the right to amend the conditions.\namendments in respect of the amount of the commission will only apply to sales which occur after notification of the respective amendment.\nAll commission amounts are inclusive of VAT to the extent VAT is due (in this regard, see also sections 10.4 to 10.6).</li>\n<li>No commission shall be due if the Referral is made in breach of these mAPC, in particular in breach of sections 4, 5 and 6.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Settlement of the commission <ol>\n<li>The settlement of commission due will be effected solely by means of credit to Affiliate\u2019s memail account.\nAffiliate may have the commission paid out or use it for ordering paid memail services.\nAffiliate may view their account balance at any time in the AAM.</li>\n<li>Commission can only be paid out once a minimum balance has been reached, the amount of which is set out in the AAM.\nThe commission will be paid out, using the payment method chosen by Affiliate, within four weeks of the respective request.\nAny transaction costs associated with the paying out of the commission (transfer fees, PayPal fees) shall be borne by Affiliate.\nmemail is entitled to retain such costs when making commission payments.</li>\n<li>Affiliate must check any commission statements and payments without delay and inform memail by email of any objections.\nObjections raised later than four weeks after the respective commission statement has been produced will not be considered.\nA request for pay out of the commission or conversion to a voucher for use in ordering paid memail services will be regarded as acceptance of the respective commission amount.</li>\n<li>Insofar as Affiliate is based in Germany and is not a small business entity, the settlement of the commission will indicate the VAT due.\nIf the small business entity is based in Germany and has provided proof of their small business status, no VAT will be due.</li>\n<li>Insofar as Affiliate is based outside Germany but within the European Union and possesses a valid VAT identification number, the VAT will not be indicated (\"reverse-charge procedure\"), provided Affiliate has already notified memail of their VAT ID number and furnished proof thereof.</li>\n<li>To the extent Affiliate (a) is based within the European Union and does not possess a valid VAT ID number or (b) is based within the European Union but has not notified memail of their VAT ID number or furnished proof thereof, the VAT will be indicated when settling the commission due.</li>\n<li>If Affiliate is based outside the European Union, the VAT will not be indicated.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Liability <ol>\n<li>memail will be liable without limitation vis-a-vis Affiliate in the case of intent and gross negligence, in the event of failure to supply warranted properties or in the event of injury to life, limb or health.</li>\n<li>In the case of simple negligence, memail shall be liable, except in cases of injury to life, limb or health, only for loss or damage arising from a not inconsiderable violation of an essential contractual obligation.\nEssential contractual obligations are all obligations which must be met to enable the due and proper performance of the contractual agreement, the violation of which jeopardizes the achievement of the purpose of the agreement and the observance of which Affiliate is entitled to rely on.\nIn that case, the liability is limited, however, to compensation for damage or loss which can typically be foreseen in this type of transaction.</li>\n<li>The limitations of liability which follow from the above paragraphs also apply in the event of breaches of obligations by or to the benefit of persons, for whose actions memail bears responsibility under the relevant statutory provisions.\nThey do not apply in cases where memail has maliciously concealed a defect, or has provided a guarantee for the quality of the goods nor do they apply for claims according to the German Product Liability Act [Produkthaftungsgesetz].</li>\n<li>Liability for any other loss or damage is excluded.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Term and termination, blocking <ol>\n<li>The agreement is concluded for an indefinite term and may be duly terminated by either party at any time without notice, in writing or text form (e.g.\nby email).\nThe right to extraordinary termination for good cause remains unaffected.\nThe termination shall be valid immediately upon receipt by the respective other contracting party.</li>\n<li>In the case of the termination of the agreement, Affiliate shall immediately lose the right to use the Advertising Materials and the AffiliateID.\nAffiliate must immediately remove all Advertising Materials, links and other references to memail and/or the mAP from the Advertising Sites.</li>\n<li>Any Referrals tracked to Affiliate\u2019s AffiliateID after the termination takes effect will no longer be attributed to Affiliate and will not lead to any commission obligation.\nOnce the termination comes into effect, any claims to commission which had arisen up to that point will cease to exist.\nthese must have been asserted against memail prior to the termination taking effect.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Confidentiality <ol>\n<li>All information and documents, in particular concerning business processes, commercial relationships and business related, technical and financial information of the contracting parties which are marked as confidential or whose confidential nature is evident from the attendant circumstances and which are disclosed to the respective other party must be handled with strict confidentiality by the receiving party.\nSuch information may only be passed to third parties after prior written consent of the disclosing party.</li>\n<li>This does not apply to confidential information (a) which was demonstrably already known to the recipient prior to conclusion of the agreement or became known to the recipient via a third party after conclusion of the agreement without violation of any confidentiality agreement, statutory provision or order of a public authority.\n(b) which was public knowledge at the time of conclusion of the agreement, provided this was not as a result of a violation of this agreement.\nand (c) which must be disclosed on the basis of statutory obligations or upon the order of a court or a public authority.</li>\n<li>This obligation will remain in force for a period of two years after termination of this agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Online dispute resolution and consumer arbitration bodies <ol>\n<li>The European Commission platform for online dispute resolution (ODR) can be found at: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.</li>\n<li>memail is neither legally obliged nor willing to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer conciliation body.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Final provisions <ol>\n<li>The language of the agreement is English.</li>\n<li>The user may only transfer the rights and obligations under this agreement to a third party after prior consent of memail in text form.</li>\n<li>All agreements between memail and the user will be governed by German law with the exclusion of the UN CISG.\nThe statutory provisions regarding the limitation of the choice of law and the applicability of mandatory provisions, in particular in the country in which the user, as a consumer, has their habitual residence, remain unaffected.</li>\n<li>Insofar as the user is a businessperson, a legal entity under public law or a special fund under public law, the place of jurisdiction for all disputes based on contractual relationships between memail and the user is Berlin.</li>\n<li>In the event of individual points being legally ineffective, the remaining parts of the agreement shall remain binding.\nThe ineffective points shall be replaced by the relevant statutory provisions to the extent such provisions exist.\nTo the extent this results in unreasonable hardship for one of the contracting parties, the agreement shall be deemed ineffective in its entirety.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Berlin, 27 February 2020</p> go ahead, <strong>select your email address below!</strong> With 1000s of options and

processing:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>You can register via our website to receive our newsletter in the future.\nTo this end, you must provide your email address and consent to the use of that email address for the future sending of the newsletter.\nThe email address andif statedname provided by you via the dedicated newsletter registration form will be used solely for the purpose of registering you to receive the newsletter, of sending the newsletter and of cancelling the newsletter.</p>\n<p>The management of recipient data for our newsletter and its sending is performed via \u201cMailChimp\u201d an online tool provided by the US service provider Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.\nThe Rocket Science Group, LLC also

adequate level of protection for the transfer to the USA.</p>\n<p>The newsletters contain a socalled \u201cweb beacon\u201d, i.e.\na pixel sized file which is accessed by the MailChimp server when the newsletter is opened.\nWhen this web beacon is accessed, technical information is collected, including information on the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of access.\nThis information is used for the technical improvement of the content and design of the newsletter, based on the technical data or the target groups and of your reading behavior, based on the places of access (ascertainable with the help of the IP address) or the times of access.\nThe statistical data collected also includes ascertaining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked.\nThis information can, for technical reasons, theoretically be attributed to the individual newsletter recipients.\nHowever, it is neither our intention nor that of MailChimp to monitor individual users.\nInstead, any evaluation performed helps us recognize the reading habits of our users and to adjust our content accordingly or to send different content in line with the interests of our users.</p>\n<p> The privacy policy of MailChimp can be found here:<br> https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Voluntary nature of the consent and right of withdrawal</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The granting of the consent necessary to receive the Newsletter is voluntary and can be withdrawn by way of a simple declaration at any time with effect for the future (e.g.\nby email to privacy@memail.com).\nMoreover, there is a link at the end of every newsletter which you can click to have yourself removed from the email mailing list and thus withdraw your consent.\nWithdrawing consent has no influence on the legitimacy of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent prior to the withdrawal.\nIt is not possible to receive the newsletter without granting consent.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Duration of storage:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The data transferred in the course of the newsletter registration is processed for as long as the user remains registered to receive the newsletter.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Legal basis:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art.\n6(1) first sentence (a) of the GDPR and for the transfer of data to MailChimp and the evaluation of the web beacon is Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR.\nThe legitimate interest is in the effective management of the newsletter and the newsletter recipients and as far as the use of the web beacon is concerned in the analysis of user behavior to improve the content and design of future newsletters.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Right to Object:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>As far as data processing based on Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR is concerned, you have a right to object, notwithstanding other rights.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Information emails to registered users <p>\n<u>\n<strong>Explanation and purpose of processing:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>Even if you do not subscribe to the newsletter, we can send information emails to registered memail users containing offers from memail, if and to the extent that we can assume that these will be of interest to you and that there are no indications that you would not wish to receive such emails or that you have objected to receiving such emails.\nThere will be a link at the end of every information email which you can use to have yourself removed from the email mailing list.</p>\n<p>Moreover, you can use the user area to select the types of messages you would like to receive or deactivate the types of messages you would not like to receive.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Legal basis:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR.\nThe legitimate interest is in advertising our own products and services to our customers.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Right to Object:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>As far as data processing based on Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR is concerned, the user has a right to object, notwithstanding other rights, specifically without incurring any costs other than the costs of sending according to the basic rates.\nOn this point, see below (\"Rights of the Data Subject\").\nA deactivation of the receipt of certain types of messages in the user area will be deemed an objection.\nAs explained above, the emails will, however, always contain a link for removing yourself from the email mailing list.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> Contact form <p>\n<u>\n<strong>Explanation and purpose of processing:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>You can contact us with any questions or requests by way of our online contact form.\nIn doing so, the personal data transmitted by you will be processed by us electronically in order to answer your question or deal with your request.</p>\n<p>The personal data collected in this context will be deleted when its storage is no longer necessary or, to the extent legal obligations to retain records exist, its processing is limited, unless further processing is required by law, such as on the basis of retention obligations under commercial or tax law.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Legal basis:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The processing of your personal data when you contact us is undertaken on the basis of Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR.\nThe legitimate interest is in responding to requests sent to us.\nUnder certain circumstances, the processing of data could also be undertaken on other legal bases.\nIn certain cases, the processing of that data could also be allowed or required on other legal bases, such as Art.\n6(1) first sentence (c) of the GDPR (legal obligations e.g.\nretention periods under commercial or tax law) or Sec.\n24(1) no.\n1 of the German Federal Data Protection Act [BDSG] (assertion of/defense of civil law claims).\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Right to Object:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>As far as data processing based on Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR is concerned, you have a right to object, notwithstanding other rights.\nOn this point, see below (\"Rights of the Data Subject\").</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Registration with and use of memail as registered user <ol>\n<li> Registration with memail <p>\n<u>\n<strong>Explanation of the data processing in relation to the registration</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The use of the memail functions requires prior registration.\nIn the registration process, the user sets a username and password (login details).\nThe basic registration, which allows memail to be viewed but not yet used, only requires a username and password to be provided but does not require any verification.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the use of the memail services requires a verification by the user, either in the course of a double optin process by email or via a mobile telephone number.\nThe purpose of this verification is to ensure that the registration is effected by a natural person (and not automated), that this person can be contacted by us by email or via the mobile telephone number and helps prevent misuse.</p>\n<p>The use of paid services requires, in addition to the provision of a username and a password, the provision of contractually relevant data of the user, such as first name and surname, address, payment data etc.\n(full registration).\nThe basic data collected during the registration process is processed to set up, deliver and bill the services and are stored in association with the created user account.\nThis data can be viewed via the user account and if necessary changed by the user.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Duration of storage</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The data collected at registration is deleted after expiry of the statutory documentation and data retention periods (in particular those set out under tax and commercial law).\nInsofar as there are no documentation and data retention periods in this regard (e.g.\nbecause the user does not use any paid services), the deletion will be performed immediately upon deletion of the respective user account, unless, in individual cases, a longer storage period is permitted or required (e.g.\ndue to the assertion of/defense against civil law claims).\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Legal basis</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The processing of the data collected at registration is required in order to set up a user account and to supply, perform and bill our contractual services to the user.\nThe legal basis for this is Art.\n6(1) first sentence (b) of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for the storage and processing of this data in the user account is Art.\n(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR.\nThe legitimate interest is in enabling the user to use memail comfortably as well as to view and where necessary correct the registered data.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for the storage of the data for the duration of the statutory documentation and data retention periods is Art.\n6(1) first sentence (c) of the GDPR and for the assertion of/defense against legal claims is Sec.\n24 (1) no.\n1 BDSG.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Right to Object:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>As far as data processing based on Art.\n6(1) first sentence (f) of the GDPR is concerned, you have a right to object, notwithstanding other rights.\nOn this point, see below (\"Rights of the Data Subject\").</p>\n</li>\n<li> Data processing during the use of memail email services <p>\n<u>\n<strong>Explanation, purpose of processing and duration of storage</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>In the course of the use of the memail services (e.g.\nsending and receiving emails), it is natural that content and usage data will be generated which is processed by us and stored to the respective user account (e.g.\nemails, email addresses, contact names, files etc.).\nThe purpose of this processing is the performance of our contractual obligations to the user (e.g.\nthe storage and display of received emails in the user account).</p>\n<p>The processing of the content and usage data will continue until such time as the user deletes the respective data (e.g.\ndeletion of emails), until deletion upon a request by the user to delete the respective user account or until the deletion of the respective user account after termination.\nDetails in this regard can be found in the Terms &amp.\nConditions (Section 10: Consequences of termination).</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Legal basis</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for the processing described above is Art.\n6(1) first sentence (b) of the GDPR.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Places of data processing and transfer to third countries <p>\n<u>\n<strong>Explanation</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>memail uses servers in various locations in order to ensure optimal performance of the services provided.\nThe data processing by memail in respect of memail users based in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) is performed on servers located within the EU such that the personal data provided by EU users to memail is processed by memail within the EU.</p>\n<p>For the data processing for memail users based outside the EU/EEA, the data processing can possibly also be performed on servers located outside the EU/EEA.\nThe required level of data protection for the associated transfer to third countries is provided in that memail exclusively uses servers from server operators which are members of the EUUS Privacy Shield Framework.\nThe European Commission issued a socalled adequacy decision in relation to the EUUS Privacy Shield under Art.\n45(1) first sentence of the GDPR by way of a decision of 12 July 2016, which confirms that the EUUS Privacy Shield ensures an adequate level of protection for a data transfer.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, memail naturally has no influence over which third parties the user communicates with via email.\nIf a user based in the EU/EEA sends, for example, emails to recipients in third countries (e.g.\nin the USA), data will be transferred to those locations accordingly.\nIn such cases, a transfer to third countries will take place in order to perform the services memail is contractually obliged to provide to user (legal basis: Art.\n6(1) first sentence (b) in conjunction with Art.\n49(1) second sentence (b) of the GDPR.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Payment for services via Stripe

<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Explanation and purpose of processing:</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The memail Affiliate Program (\u201cmAP\u201d) offers registered users the possibility of inviting third parties, via a personalized AffiliateID, to use memail and of participating in contracts concluded using that AffiliateID.\nDetails can be found here: https://www.memail.com/terms-conditions</p>\n<p>The AffiliateID generated by memail for every registered memail user, which is stored to their user account, can, for example, be sent to third parties in the form of a promolink (www.memail.com/AffiliateID) or directly as a promocode from the advertising user (\u201cAffiliate\u201d).\nmemail itself will not send the AffiliateID to third parties.\nThe originally generated AffiliateID is a random alphanumeric string of characters, however the memail user can change and thus personalize it.</p>\n<p>If the third party uses the AffiliateIDas a promocode or via the promolinkto conclude a contract, this will be stored by memail to the account of the new user.\nAt the same time, the following information will be sent to the Affiliate.\nThe time of conclusion of the contract, location of the new memail user (country) and total price of the contract concluded.\nNo information about the new user is sent to the Affiliate.</p>\n<p>We hereby advise that the Affiliate, in the case of a use of their AffiliateID in the course of a contract conclusion by the third party, could, under certain circumstances, draw conclusions as to which person has concluded the new contract (e.g.\nif the Affiliate only sends the AffiliateID to a single third party and a conclusion of a contract follows).</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>Legal basis</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The
