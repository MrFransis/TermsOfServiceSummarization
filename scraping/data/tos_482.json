RISKS.\nRELEASE OF XAPO\n<p>Receiving, storing and transferring Digital Currency, and use of other Services provided by Xapo, involves significant risks and potential for financial losses, including without limitation the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Digital Currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation.</li>\n<li>The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of any Digital Currency and the software, networks, protocols, systems, and other technology (including, if applicable, any blockchain) (\u201cUnderlying Technology\u201d) used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in any Digital Currency may be complex, technical or difficult to understand or evaluate.</li>\n<li>The nature of Digital Currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by Xapo may prevent the access or use of a customer\u2019s Digital Currency.</li>\n<li>Any Digital Currency and its Underlying Technology may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation of the Digital Currency unit or its Underlying Technology (\u201cAttacks\u201d), including Attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of a blockchain or other Underlying Technology.</li>\n<li>The nature of Digital Currency may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber attack.</li>\n<li>Any Digital Currency or Underlying Technology may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to a change made to the Underlying Technology, a change made using features or functions built into the Underlying Technology or a change resulting from an Attack.\nThese changes may include, without limitation, a \u201cfork\u201d or \u201crollback\u201d of a Digital Currency or blockchain.</li>\n<li>Any Digital Currency may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their value, due to forks, rollbacks, Attacks, or failure of the Digital Currency to operate as intended.</li>\n<li>Some Digital Currency transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that the customer initiates the transaction.</li>\n<li>The value of Digital Currency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for Digital Currency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular Digital Currency should the market for that Digital Currency disappear.</li>\n<li>Any Digital Currency may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to Digital Currency properties or perceived value of Digital Currency properties, Attacks, suspension or cessation of support for a Digital Currency by Xapo or other exchanges or service providers, and other factors outside the control of Xapo.</li>\n<li>The volatility and unpredictability of the price of Digital Currency relative to fiat currency may result in significant loss over a short period of time.</li>\n<li>Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Currency.\nGovernment regulation of Digital Currency is unsettled and rapidly evolving.</li>\n<li>Xapo may not be a regulated entity in your jurisdiction, and your Digital Currency or fiat currency held with Xapo may not be regarded as a deposit or be eligible for deposit insurance programs.</li>\n<li>Any bond or trust account maintained by Xapo for the benefit of its customers may not be sufficient to cover all losses incurred by customers.</li>\n<li>There is no assurance that a person who accepts a Digital Currency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.</li>\n<li>Any Digital Currency may be lost if sent to the wrong address (for example but without limitation, if the address is improperly formatted, contains errors, or is intended to be used for a different type of Digital Currency).\nOn many Digital Currency networks, such as Bitcoin, transactions are generally irreversible and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The risks described in this Section 9 may result in loss of Digital Currency, decrease in or loss of all value for Digital Currency, inability to access or transfer Digital Currency, inability to trade Digital Currency, inability to receive financial benefits available to other Digital Currency holders, and other financial losses to you.\nYou hereby assume, and agree that Xapo will have no responsibility or liability for, such risks.\nYou hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Xapo and its shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein.\nYou waive application of Section 1542 of the Civil Code of the State of California, or any similar statute or law of any other jurisdiction.\nSection 1542 reads as follows: \u201cA GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.\u201d</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant that you have: (a) the necessary technical expertise and ability to review and evaluate the security, integrity and operation of any Digital Currency that you decide to acquire.\nand (b) the knowledge, experience, understanding, professional advice and information to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any Digital Currency.\nYou accept the risk of receiving, storing and transferring Digital Currency through the Services, and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to the Digital Currency and the Services.</p>\n#10.\nUSER CONTENT\n<p>Our Services may allow you and other users to create, post, store and share content, including messages, texts, photos, videos, software and other materials (collectively, \u201cUser Content\u201d).\nExcept for the license you grant below, you retain all rights in and to your User Content, as between you and Xapo.</p>\n<p>You grant Xapo a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive,

obligation to screen, edit or monitor User Content, we may delete or remove User Content at any time and for any reason with or without notice.</p>\n#11.\nGENERAL SERVICE TERMS\n<p>\n<strong>11.1.\nSupport for Bitcoin Only.</strong> The only Digital Currency supported by Xapo is bitcoin.\nIf you want to store, transfer and/or use any Digital Currency other than bitcoin, you cannot do it through the Xapo Services.\nIf you send or transfer to your Xapo Wallet or Vault any Digital Currency that is not bitcoin, Xapo shall not be responsible for receiving or storing it in any way and you may lose any right in connection to such Digital Currency or value without any right or claim to Xapo.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.\nThe Xapo Services.</strong> Xapo provides a way to store, use, and manage bitcoins, using our wallet service, which we call Xapo Wallet, and the Xapo deep cold storage service, which we call Xapo Vault.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.1.\nPurchase and Sale of Bitcoins.</strong> To purchase from or sell bitcoins to Xapo, simply click on the red [BUY BITCOINS] button or after logging in to our Website or Apps.\nYou will be taken through a process that locks in a bitcoin price for 300 seconds, then displays different methods, depending on your location and some other factors, to either (a) transfer fiat currency to Xapo pay for your purchased bitcoin or (b) withdraw fiat currency as proceeds from your sold bitcoin.\nThe purchase, sale and fiat currency transfer options are personalized to each user based upon certain factors involved, so only specific payment options are shown for each purchase or sale order.\nXapo does not charge fees for buying or selling bitcoins, but processing fees may apply depending on the payment method.\nThe price level at which we sell bitcoins to or purchase bitcoins from our customers is the price listed on our Website or Apps as the Xapo price.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information included when you initiate your transfer of fiat currency, including by wire transfer or ACH transaction.\nThis includes the account number, bank routing number, your Xapo-specific reference number and any other information requested by us.\n</p>\n<p>To withdraw Digital Currency from your Xapo Wallet, simply click on the TRANSFER button after logging in.\nYou will be taken through a process that will display a quote of the value assigned by Xapo to one bitcoin in your selected fiat currency, allowing you to transfer such value to the selected account.\nAfter accepting the quote, we will display a message indicating that the transfer to the selected account is being processed.</p>\n<p>Please review carefully our current Exchange Transactions Rules here.\n</p>\n<p>When funding or withdrawing funds from your Xapo Wallet through wire transfer and/or any payment processor and/or payment method, incoming or withdrawn funds can be sent from or to an account in your own name or in the name of a third party.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information included in your transfer of funds, including account number, bank routing number, your Xapo-specific reference number and any other information requested by us.\nXapo cannot revoke or cancel a wire once it has been initiated by a bank.\nYou shall be solely responsible for all costs, losses, damages and liabilities arising from any reversal of funds initiated by Xapo as a result of your failing to comply with the provisions of this Section 11.\nXapo reserves the right to delay or not process incoming or withdrawing wires and/or other transfers or payment processor method for any reason, including to verify that the wire or other transfer was actually initiated by you or where required or recommended by applicable governmental, regulatory or law enforcement requirements.\nXapo is not liable for any act, omission, mistake, default, delay, negligence, misconduct or insolvency of any third party, including any bank, entity or person.</p>\nOTC Transactions\n<p>OTC Transactions shall be conducted by Xapo and you in accordance to industry custom and practice, which means industry standards, practices, methods and procedures conforming to the applicable laws and regulations, and the exercise of the degree of skill and care, diligence, prudence and foresight which would reasonably and ordinarily be expected from a skilled and experienced person or body engaged within the cryptocurrency industry and business sector.</p>\n<p>Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the OTC Transaction entered into thereunder, including any question regarding its existence, validity, invalidity or any breach or termination thereof, shall be settled in accordance with Section 22 of these Terms.\nThe Xapo address provided in these Terms shall be deemed to be the place of performance of all obligations arising under the Agreement and the OTC Transactions entered into hereunder.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.2.\nProcessing Fees.</strong> Please review carefully our current processing fees here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outgoing transactions.\nOutgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo Account to another Xapo Account are not subject to any processing fee.\nOutgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo Account to a bitcoin address outside of Xapo are subject to a processing fee that you can review here: Bitcoin Transaction Fees.</li>\n<li>Incoming transactions.\nIncoming bitcoin transactions to your Xapo Wallet and/or Vault equal to or below a certain amount are subject to a special processing fee so as to cover the transaction cost of the Bitcoin network.\nThis special processing fee shall be automatically deducted from the respective transaction.\nPlease review our current special processing fee here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Xapo reserves the right to charge additional fees or to change the amount of fees, and we will provide you at least 30 days advance notice of any such change.\nXapo reserves the right to waive and/or reduce any fee at any time, with or without notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.3.\nXapo Bitcoin Reserve.</strong> Xapo maintains a proprietary reserve of bitcoins (\u201cBitcoin Reserve\u201d) that is designed to ease the impact of bitcoin losses that are a direct consequence of certain incidents, as described below, and that are not related in any way with your own actions, omissions or errors.\nThe Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is provided to you at no charge.</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is designed to cover direct and effective losses suffered by users as a result of attacks of hackers to our systems, theft by any third party and/or Xapo employee from our systems or facilities, break-ins at a physical location of our vaults, and/or our bankruptcy, which are not due to or related to your acts, omissions or errors (\u201cQualifying Losses\u201d).</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve does not cover cases of hacking of individuals\u2019 and entities\u2019 systems, devices and personal accounts, such as phones, computers, email accounts, etc.\nFor example, a loss suffered as a result of your failure to maintain adequate security, control or confidentiality of your Xapo Account information, including any Account Credentials or other codes associated with your Xapo Account and any activity occurring within that Xapo Account, will not be considered a Qualifying Loss.</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is primarily designed to cover the loss of bitcoins stored by our users in the Xapo Vault, our deep cold storage service that incorporates multiple layers of cryptographic security to help secure your bitcoins.\nThese processes include multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation between others.</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is also designed to cover bitcoins held by Xapo in \u201cHot Storage\u201d (i.e., connected to a network in order to meet the liquidity needs of Xapo Wallet users) and it is intended to hold an equal or greater amount of bitcoins than the bitcoins held by Xapo in Hot Storage.</p>\n<p>WHILE WE HAVE DESIGNED THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE TO HELP LESSEN THE IMPACT OF BITCOIN LOSSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR USERS\u2019 CONTROL, WE DO NOT AND CANNOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE WILL HAVE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BITCOINS TO COVER ANY OR ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY OUR USERS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>\n<p>In the event of a Qualifying Loss, bitcoins stored by users in our Vault will have priority to be covered by the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve.\nQualifying Losses by Xapo Wallet users shall only be covered by the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve after the Qualifying Losses of Vault users have been covered, because bitcoins held in Xapo Wallets are subject to a higher propensity for cyber-attack, and we reward users that take their own security measures, including preferring our Vault Service.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve shall cover the Qualifying Losses in the following priority order:</p>\n<p>(i) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Vault of users.\nIf the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to cover 100% of Vault users\u2019 Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Vault users\u2019 losses on a pro rata basis, based upon the total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all Xapo users as a result of the incident.</p>\n<p>(ii) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Wallet of our users.\nIf the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to cover 100% of Wallet users\u2019 Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Xapo Wallet users\u2019 losses on a pro rata basis, based upon the total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all Xapo users as a result of the incident.</p>\n<p>For avoidance of doubt, each Entity user is counted only once in the above calculations, regardless of how many authorized persons use the Services on behalf of that Entity user.</p>\n<p>The use of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is optional for our users.\nAs a condition to receiving any bitcoins and/or funds from the coverage of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve, you agree to (i) timely cooperate with Xapo upon its request in connection with any coverage claim relating to your bitcoins, including by timely providing any information or documentation that Xapo reasonably requests, and (ii) sign any documents, including but not limited to a release of further claims against Xapo, that Xapo may require.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3.\nForks.</strong> If, as a consequence of a \u201cfork\u201d (as such term is commonly known in the bitcoin industry), bitcoin holders are granted an equivalent or proportional amount of a new Digital Currency or values that are not bitcoin, Xapo shall not have any obligation whatsoever in connection to such new Digital Currency or value, provided, however, that Xapo may grant you, at its sole discretion, a reasonable term to withdraw such Digital Currency or value and transfer it to a third party.\nIf you choose not to withdraw the total balance of the Digital Currency or value within such term, Xapo reserves the right to automatically convert the total balance of such Digital Currency into bitcoin and credit it to your Xapo Wallet.\nThe above does not mean and shall not be interpreted in any way as an obligation of Xapo to provide any support or withdraw option of any Digital Currency or value other than bitcoin.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.4.\nContinuity of Services.</strong> Our Services may evolve over time.\nThis means we may make changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice.\nIn this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services.\nIf, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with notice via our Website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.5.\nBitcoin Transactions.</strong> Xapo cannot and does not guarantee the value of bitcoins.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the value of bitcoins is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding bitcoins involves a high degree of risk.\nAdditionally, the bitcoin consensus network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and Xapo cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse wallet-to-wallet transactions, other than confirmation of the Bitcoin network\u2019s completion of a transaction.\nThe Bitcoin network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties.\nOnce a transaction request has been submitted to the Bitcoin network via the Services, the Bitcoin network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Xapo is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any bitcoin transaction initiated via the Services.\nThe Services help you submit your bitcoin transaction request for confirmation to the Bitcoin network.\nHowever, Xapo has no control over the Bitcoin network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be completed.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Bitcoin network.\nWhen you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Bitcoin network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.</p>\n<p>To increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo, Xapo has designed high-level security measures to the Services.\nFor that reason, Xapo bitcoin sending addresses are not designed to receive bitcoin for Xapo users.\nTherefore, Xapo cannot and does not guarantee that any bitcoin transaction reversed by a third party, and/or bitcoins sent directly to any Xapo sending address, shall be received by the Xapo user intended to receive such reversed transaction or bitcoins sent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.6.\nBitcoin Transactions.\nTransmission Delays.</strong> Xapo Services include several security measures and layers to increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo.\nFor this reason, transaction(s) to a bitcoin address outside Xapo for a significant amount of bitcoins, may take longer than a standard transaction(s) of bitcoin.\nYou acknowledge and agree that a transaction(s) to a bitcoin address outside of Xapo system for a significant amount of bitcoins may be delayed.</p>\n<p>Before processing any transaction(s), Xapo reserves the right to take necessary time for the purpose of verifying your identity, verifying your activity and conducting security and other internal procedures in relation to your Xapo Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.7.\nWallet Address and Private Key.</strong> When you create a Xapo Account as an individual or Entity, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive bitcoins via the Bitcoin network.\nThe public key generated by the Services serves as your bitcoin wallet address, and may be shared with the Bitcoin network and with others to complete bitcoin transactions.\nThe private key uniquely matches the wallet address and must be used in connection with the wallet address to authorize the transfer of bitcoin from or to that wallet address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.8.\nCustody of Bitcoins.</strong> Xapo is a custodian of any bitcoins transferred to a Xapo Wallet or Xapo Vault.\nXapo does not obtain any legal or beneficial right, title or interest in your bitcoins that you store in your Wallet and Vault.\nPlease note, however, that Xapo may give you a small amount of bits in connection with your creation of an account with Xapo (bits are a fractional amount of bitcoins equal to 0.000001 of one bitcoin), but unless and until you have verified your identity with Xapo, you will not have a legal or beneficial right to these bits from Xapo and may be restricted in your ability to utilize the Xapo Services.\nOnce you have verified your identity with Xapo and Xapo has determined that your use of the Xapo Services complies with applicable laws, these will become your bits and Xapo will no longer have any legal or beneficial right to these bits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.9.\nUnacceptable Use or Conduct.</strong> You will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>violate these terms or any law, regulation, contract, intellectual property or other third-party

permanently barred, which means that you and Xapo will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>\n<p>If any portion of this Section 22 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.\n(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 22 or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 22.\nand (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.\nFurther, if any part of this Section 22 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 22 will be enforceable.</p>\n#23.\nGOVERNING LAW AND

blockchain)\n(\u201cUnderlying Technology\u201d) used to administer, create, issue, transfer, cancel, use or transact in any Digital\nCurrency may be complex, technical or difficult to understand or

(\u201cAttacks\u201d), including Attacks using computing power\nsufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of a blockchain or other Underlying Technology.</p>\n<p>Any Digital Currency or Underlying Technology may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to a\nchange made to the Underlying Technology, a change made using features or functions built into the Underlying\nTechnology or a change resulting from an Attack.\nThese changes may include, without limitation, a \u201cfork\u201d or\n\u201crollback\u201d of a Digital Currency or blockchain.</p>\n<p>Any Digital Currency may be cancelled, lost or double spent, or otherwise lose all or most of their value,\ndue to forks, rollbacks, Attacks, or failure of the Digital Currency to operate as intended.</p>\n<p>Any Digital Currency may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including\ndiscovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to Digital Currency properties or perceived value\nof Digital Currency properties, Attacks, suspension or cessation of support for a Digital Currency by Xapo or\nother exchanges or service providers, and other factors outside the control of Xapo.</p>\n<p>Any Digital Currency may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to legislative or regulatory\nactivity, or other government action.\nGovernment regulation of Digital Currency is unsettled and rapidly\nevolving.</p>\n<p>Any Digital Currency may be lost if sent to the wrong address (for example but without limitation, if the\naddress is improperly formatted, contains errors, or is intended to be used for a different type of Digital\nCurrency).</p>\n<p>The risks described in this Section 9 may result in loss of Digital Currency, decrease in or loss of all\nvalue for Digital Currency, inability to access or transfer Digital Currency, inability to trade Digital\nCurrency, inability to receive financial benefits available to other Digital Currency holders, and other\nfinancial losses to you.\nYou hereby assume, and agree that Xapo will have no responsibility or liability for\nsuch risks.\nYou hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims,

irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid, and sublicensable\nlicense to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute,\npublicly perform and display your User Content and any name, username or likeness provided in connection with\nyour User Content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed without

SERVICE TERMS <p>\n<strong>11.1.\nSupport for Bitcoin Only.</strong> The only Digital Currency supported\nby Xapo is bitcoin.\nIf you want to store, transfer and/or use any Digital Currency other than bitcoin, you\ncannot do it through the Xapo Services.\nIf you send or transfer to your Xapo Wallet or Vault any Digital\nCurrency that is not bitcoin, Xapo shall not be responsible for receiving or storing it in any way and you may\nlose any right in connection to such Digital Currency or value without any right or claim to Xapo.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.\nThe Xapo Services.</strong> Xapo provides a way to receive, transfer, store, and manage bitcoins, using our wallet service, which we call Xapo Wallet, and the Xapo deep cold storage service, which we call Xapo Vault.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.1.\nBitcoin Management.</strong> To manage your bitcoins with Xapo, simply click on the respective transaction button after logging in.\nYou will be taken through a process that will display the relevant information to conduct the intended transaction.\nYou shall pay transactions with available funds in your Xapo Wallet and available payment methods provided by Xapo, depending on your location and some other factors.\nIt is personalized to each user and certain factors involved, so only specific payment options are shown for each order.\nAt the end of the process, the transaction shall be debited from or credited to the respective account of your Xapo Wallet.</p>\n<p>Xapo does not charge fees for adding or withdrawing funds, but processing fees may apply depending on the payment method.\nYour ability to fund or withdraw your Xapo Wallet may be subject to limits we may establish from time to time.</p>\n<p>When funding or withdrawing your Xapo Wallet through wire transfer and/or any payment processor and/or payment methods, incoming or withdrawn funds can be sent from or to an account in your own name or in the name of a third party.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information included in your transfer of funds, including account number, bank routing number, your Xapo-specific reference number and any other information requested by us.\nXapo cannot revoke or cancel a wire once it has been initiated by a bank.\nYou shall be solely responsible for all costs, losses, damages and liabilities arising from any reversal of funds initiated by Xapo as a result of your failing to comply with the provisions of this section.\nXapo reserves the right to delay or not process incoming or withdrawing wires and/or payment processor method for any reason, and where required by governmental, regulatory or law enforcement requirements.\nXapo is not liable for any act, omission, mistake, default, delay, negligence, misconduct or insolvency of any third party, including any bank, entity or person.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that when you instruct Xapo to transfer funds between wallets, Xapo does an equivalent finance transaction in accordance with your instructions, incurring in a hedge for the risk of adverse price movements of bitcoin and/or the default currency to be transferred.\nTherefore, you acknowledge and agree that the cancellation of a transfer of funds from one wallet to another is not neutral, and it may be subject to an adjustment equivalent to the difference between the prices involved in the entire transaction.\nXapo does not earn any profit from these eventual adjustments.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.2.\nBitcoin/Fiat Denomination Service.</strong> In case the E-Money Services rendered by Xapo Bank (Gibraltar) Limited are available in your jurisdiction, the following\nE-money Terms\nwill apply.\nIn case such E-money Services are not available in your jurisdiction, Xapo provides you our Bitcoin/Fiat Denomination Service.\nYou are solely responsible for determining whether the E- money Services rendered by Xapo Bank (Gibraltar) Limited are authorised in your jurisdiction according to local applicable laws and regulations and the E-money terms provided in the link above.\n</p>\n<p>The Bitcoin Fiat Denomination Service (\u201cFiat Accounts\u201d) is a wallet service that allows you to keep your Xapo Wallet balance in a default Fiat currency, locking the value of your bitcoins in the default Fiat currency, at a certain conversion rate agreed by you through the process of the relevant transaction.\nYour Fiat Account will always hold bitcoins, displayed in the equivalent amount of the default Fiat currency locked by you upon conversion.</p>\n<p>For the sake of clarity, Xapo will hold at all and any time in your Fiat Accounts bitcoins upon which you and Xapo agreed its value in the default Fiat currency.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.3.\nPaid Services.</strong> Xapo charges a recurring fee to allow you to access the Xapo Services.\nPlease review our current recurring fee here.\nXapo reserves the right to change the amount of fees, including but not limited to the amount of the recurring fee, and to charge additional fees, including but not limited to dormancy fees, services fees, maintenance fees, closing fees and penalty fees in connection with account inactivity and/or lack of response to Xapo notices when an action from you is required with reasonable prior notice, and we will provide you at least 30 days advance notice of any such changes and/or additional fees.\nXapo reserves the right to charge a reduced fee in case the available balance in your Xapo account is not enough to cover the entire applicable fee.\nXapo reserves the right to waive and/or reduce any fee at any time, with or without notice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.4.\nXapo Debit Card.</strong> Xapo currently is not offering Debit Card\nservices.\nThis section shall be duly updated as soon as the new Debit Card product is offered to our users.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.5.\nOther Fees.</strong> Please review carefully our\ncurrent processing fees here.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nOutgoing transactions.\nOutgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo Account to\nanother Xapo Account are not subject to any processing fee.\nOutgoing bitcoin transactions from your Xapo\nAccount to a bitcoin address outside of Xapo are subject to a processing fee that you can review here:\nBitcoin Transaction Fees.\n</li>\n<li>\nIncoming transactions.\nIncoming bitcoin transactions to your Xapo Wallet and/or\nVault equal to or below a certain amount are subject to a special processing fee so as to cover the\ntransaction cost of the Bitcoin network.\nThis special processing fee shall be automatically deducted from\nthe respective transaction.\nPlease review our\ncurrent special processing fee here\n.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.6.\nXapo Bitcoin Reserve.</strong> Xapo maintains a proprietary reserve\nof bitcoins (\u201cBitcoin Reserve\u201d) that is designed to ease the impact of bitcoin losses that are a direct\nconsequence of certain incidents, as described below, and that are not related in any way with your own\nactions, omissions or errors.\nThe Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is provided to you at no charge.\n</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is designed to cover direct and effective losses suffered by users as a result of\nattacks of hackers to our systems, theft by any third party and/or Xapo employee from our systems or\nfacilities, break-ins at a physical location of our vaults, and/or our bankruptcy, which are not due to or\nrelated to your acts, omissions or errors (\u201cQualifying Losses\u201d).</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve does not cover cases of hacking of individuals\u2019 and entities\u2019 systems, devices and\npersonal accounts, such as phones, computers, email accounts, etc.\nFor example, a loss suffered as a result of\nyour failure to maintain adequate security, control or confidentiality of your Xapo Account information,\nincluding any personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, API keys or other codes associated with your\nXapo Account and any activity occurring within that Xapo Account, will not be considered a Qualifying Loss.\n</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is primarily designed to cover the loss of bitcoins stored by our users in the Xapo\nVault, our deep cold storage service that incorporates multiple layers of cryptographic security to help\nsecure your bitcoins.\nThese processes include multi-factor authentication and private key segmentation between\nothers.</p>\n<p>The Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is also designed to cover bitcoins held by Xapo in \u201cHot Storage\u201d (i.e., connected to\na network in order to meet the liquidity needs of Xapo Wallet users) and it is intended to hold an equal or\ngreater amount of bitcoins than the bitcoins held by Xapo in Hot Storage.</p>\n<p>WHILE WE HAVE DESIGNED THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE TO HELP LESSEN THE IMPACT OF BITCOIN LOSSES THAT ARE OUTSIDE\nOF OUR USERS\u2019 CONTROL, WE DO NOT AND CANNOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE XAPO BITCOIN RESERVE WILL HAVE A\nSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF BITCOINS TO COVER ANY OR ALL LOSSES SUFFERED BY OUR USERS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.</p>\n<p>In the event of a Qualifying Loss, bitcoins stored by users in our Vault will have priority to be covered by\nthe Xapo Bitcoin Reserve.\nQualifying Losses by Xapo Wallet users shall only be covered by the Xapo Bitcoin\nReserve after the Qualifying Losses of Vault users have been covered, because bitcoins held in Xapo Wallets\nare subject to a higher propensity for cyber-attack, and we reward users that take their own security\nmeasures, including preferring our Vault Service.</p>\n<p>In these cases, the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve shall cover the Qualifying Losses in the following priority order:\n</p>\n<p>(i) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Vault of users.\nIf the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to cover\n100% of Vault users\u2019 Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Vault users\u2019 losses on a pro rata basis, based upon the\ntotal value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all Xapo users as a\nresult of the incident.</p>\n<p>(ii) Qualifying Losses stored in the Xapo Wallet of our users.\nIf the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is not enough to\ncover 100% of Wallet users\u2019 Qualifying Losses, it shall cover Xapo Wallet users\u2019 losses on a pro rata basis,\nbased upon the total value of their Qualifying Losses in proportion to the total value of bitcoin lost by all\nXapo users as a result of the incident.</p>\n<p>For avoidance of doubt, each Entity user is counted only once in the above calculations, regardless of how\nmany authorized persons use the Services on behalf of that Entity user.</p>\n<p>The use of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve is optional for our users.\nAs a condition to receiving any bitcoins\nand/or funds from the coverage of the Xapo Bitcoin Reserve, you agree to (i) timely cooperate with Xapo upon\nits request in connection with any coverage claim relating to your bitcoins, including by timely providing any\ninformation or documentation that Xapo reasonably requests, and (ii) sign any documents, including but not\nlimited to a release of further claims against Xapo, that Xapo may require.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.2.7.\nCommunications.</strong> All our communications with you will be in English.\nOther languages may be used for convenience purposes only, but we do not warrant that we will use other languages other than English to communicate with you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.3.\nForks.</strong> If, as a consequence of a \u201cfork\u201d (as such term is commonly known in the bitcoin industry), bitcoin holders are granted an equivalent or proportional amount of a new Digital Currency or values that are not bitcoin, Xapo shall not have any obligation whatsoever in connection to such new Digital Currency or value, provided, however, that Xapo may grant you, at its sole discretion, a reasonable term to withdraw such Digital Currency or value and transfer it to a third party.\nIf you choose not to withdraw the total balance of the Digital Currency or value within such term, Xapo reserves the right to automatically convert the total balance of such Digital Currency into bitcoin and credit it to your Xapo Wallet.\nThe above does not mean and shall not be interpreted in any way as an obligation of Xapo to provide any support or withdrawal option of any Digital Currency or value other than bitcoin.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.4.\nContinuity of Services.</strong> Our Services may evolve over time.\nThis means we may make changes, replace, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) our Services at any time for any reason with or without notice.\nIn this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services.\nIf, in our sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with notice via our website or mobile apps.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.5.\nBitcoin Transactions.</strong> Xapo cannot and does not guarantee the\nvalue of bitcoins.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the value of bitcoins is highly volatile and that buying,\nselling, and holding bitcoins involves a high degree of risk.\nAdditionally, the bitcoin consensus network is\nsolely responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and\nXapo cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse wallet-to- wallet transactions, other than confirmation\nof the Bitcoin network\u2019s completion of a transaction.\nThe Bitcoin network is operated by a decentralized\nnetwork of independent third parties.\nOnce a transaction request has been submitted to the Bitcoin network via\nthe Services, the Bitcoin network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able\nto cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Xapo is not responsible\nfor any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any bitcoin transaction initiated via the\nServices.\nThe Services help you submit your bitcoin transaction request for confirmation to the Bitcoin\nnetwork.\nHowever, Xapo has no control over the Bitcoin network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that\nany transaction request you submit via the Services will be completed.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the\ntransaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the\nBitcoin network.\nWhen you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your\ntransaction request to the Bitcoin network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.\n</p>\n<p>To increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo, Xapo has designed high-level security measures to\nthe Services.\nFor that reason, Xapo bitcoin sending addresses are not designed to receive bitcoin for Xapo\nusers.\nTherefore, Xapo cannot and does not guarantee that any bitcoin transaction reversed by a third party,\nand/or bitcoins sent directly to any Xapo sending address, shall be received by the Xapo user intended to\nreceive such reversed transaction or bitcoins sent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.6.\nBitcoin Transactions.\nTransmission Delays.</strong> Xapo Services\ninclude several security measures and layers to increase the security of your bitcoins storage at Xapo.\nFor\nthis reason, transaction(s) to a bitcoin address outside Xapo for a significant amount of bitcoins, may take\nlonger than a standard transaction(s) of bitcoin.\nYou acknowledge and agree that a transaction(s) to a bitcoin\naddress outside of Xapo system for a significant amount of bitcoins may be delayed.\n</p>\n<p>Before processing any transaction(s), Xapo reserves the right to take necessary time for the purpose of\nverifying your identity, verifying your activity and conducting security and other internal procedures in\nrelation to your Xapo Account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.7.\nWallet Address and Private Key.</strong> When you create an Xapo\nAccount as an individual or Entity, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key\npair that you may use to send and receive bitcoins via the Bitcoin network.\nThe public key generated by the\nServices serves as your bitcoin wallet address, and may be shared with the Bitcoin network and with others to\ncomplete bitcoin transactions.\nThe private key uniquely matches the wallet address and must be used in\nconnection with the wallet address to authorize the transfer of bitcoin from or to that wallet address.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.8.\nCustody of Bitcoins.</strong> Xapo is a custodian of any bitcoins\ntransferred to a Xapo Wallet or Xapo Vault.\nXapo does not obtain any legal or beneficial right, title or\ninterest in your bitcoins that you store in your Wallet and Vault.\nPlease note, however, that Xapo may give\nyou a small amount of bits in connection with your creation of an account with Xapo (bits are a fractional\namount of bitcoins equal to 0.000001 of one bitcoin), but unless and until you have verified your identity\nwith Xapo, you will not have a legal or beneficial right to these bits from Xapo and may be restricted in your\nability to utilize the Xapo Services.\nOnce you have verified your identity with Xapo and Xapo has determined\nthat your use of the Xapo Services complies with applicable laws, these will become your bits and Xapo will no\nlonger have any legal or beneficial right to these bits.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.9.\nUnacceptable Use or Conduct.</strong> You will not:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>violate any law, regulation, contract, intellectual property or other third-party right, or commit

Customer, also known as KYC) and profiling (Customer Due Diligence, also known as CDD) for the purposes of the execution of our Anti Money Laundering (also known as AML) and Counter Terrorism Financing (also known as CTF) customer identification and verification process obligations.</p>\n<p>When Xapo asks for CDD, what this refers to is proof of address and proof of identification.\nThis along with information gathered at the application stage paints a picture of any customer (KYC).\nWithout KYC, Xapo may unknowingly become involved with illicit activities and therefore subject to reputational, operational and legal risks, which can result in significant financial cost, or eventual winding up of the institution.\nKYC is most closely associated with the fight against money-laundering.</p>\n<p>Specific proof of address, proof of Identification, source of funds and/or AML-CTF questionnaires that aimed at to fulfil KYC and CDD obligations are compulsory to Xapo users and the failure to be replied might lead (in extreme cases) in the blocking of their accounts or the refusal of services.</p>\n<p>In response to the scale and effect of money laundering, the European Union has passed Directives designed to combat money laundering and terrorism.\nThese Directives, together with national regulations as read below, form the cornerstone of our AML/CTF obligations, establish the legal basis for us to process this data and outline the offenses and penalties for failing to comply.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Council Decision of 17 October 2000 concerning arrangements for cooperation between financial intelligence units of the Member States in respect of exchanging information (2000/642/JHA);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Crime Proceeds of Crime Act 2015;&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Terrorism Act

to prevent money laundering by meeting the European standards on combating money laundering and terrorism financing, including the need to have adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the firm being used to facilitate financial crime.\nOur AML policy sets out the minimum standards which must be complied with and includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Appointing a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) who has a sufficient level of seniority and independence, and who has responsibility for oversight of compliance with the relevant legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establishing and maintaining a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to the assessment and management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks faced by the firm.\nThe requirement to provide CDD related data throughout an RBA that will always take into account different factors such as the status of the client, the nature of the transactions, the financial product or the financial flows involved;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establishing and maintaining risk-based Customer Due Diligence (CDD), identification, verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, including enhanced due diligence for customers presenting a higher risk, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establishing and maintaining risk-based systems and procedures for the monitoring of on-going customer activity;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Establishing procedures for reporting suspicious activity internally and to the relevant law enforcement authorities as appropriate;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintaining appropriate records for the minimum prescribed periods;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing training for and raising awareness among all relevant employees.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a regulated financial institution, Xapo has specific requirements regarding AML systems and procedures.\nThis reflects senior management\u2019s desire to prevent money laundering.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sanctions Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Xapo is prohibited from transacting with individuals, companies and countries that are on prescribed sanctions lists.\nXapo will therefore screen against United Nations, European Union, UK Treasury and US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions lists in all jurisdictions in which we operate.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automated Decision Making</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use semi-automated processes which includes, but is not limited to, screening Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) data you provide to us in order to assess whether or not we are legally able to allow you to use our services.</p>\n<p>All automated screenings matches are manually reviewed by Xapo compliance analysts.\nThe analyst will review the triage cases to determine if they should be cleared or escalated to the MLRO.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties AML-KYC</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where processing of personal data is carried out on behalf of Xapo by a third party provider, we conclude a separate contract with the processor with respect to this processing.\nThis contract ensures compliance with European data protection regulations and defines sufficient guarantees for the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, which ensure the protection of your rights.</p>Categories of Providers<p>\n<strong>Category of Providers</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Service

computer, tablet or smartphone by websites that you visit.\nThey are generally used to make websites function, or function more efficiently.\nThey can allow you to access information that, perhaps, is limited to you as a registered user, or to remember your preferences, or record what you have put in your shopping basket.\nThey also provide information to those operating a website, for example counting the number of people looking at a website, where they come from, the type of browser/device they use.</p>\n<p>We use cookies and similar technologies on this Website to personalize content and to analyze our traffic.</p>\n<p>By using and browsing this Website, you consent to cookies being used in accordance with this Cookie Policy.\nIf you do not consent, you must turn off cookies or

these cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Both first-party and third-party cookies are used on this Website.</p>\n<p>First-party cookies are cookies set by us and which enable the Website to work as you might expect it to.\nThey are also used to give us anonymised data about how our Website is being used, the browser, the type of device accessing it and where, generally, the device is located.</p>\n<p>Third-party cookies are set by others, but may also enable us to learn more about our visitors/customers, allowing us to provide a more personalised service, or in connection with advertising.</p>\n<p>We will ask for your permission to place cookies or other similar on your device, except where it is essential for us to use them in order to provide you with a service that you have requested.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do we use cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies in a number of ways to improve your experience of using the Website.\nWhere applicable, these include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>learning how you use the Website;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>showing you content that is relevant to you;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>The cookies that we use fall into six distinct groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Essential: these cookies are necessary for the operation of this Website, or essential to the provision of the services you have requested.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Performance: these cookies measure how often you visit our sites and how you use them.\nThey also allow us to calculate the number of visitors to this Website, see what those visitors do on the Website, how long they spend on the Website, and which links they click.\nThese cookies help us to improve how this Website works, and enable us to make changes so that users stay longer or return more often.\nIf you block these cookies, we will not be able to improve our services as easily.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Targeting: similar to performance cookies, these cookies tell us which pages you visit, and the links you follow, so that we can make the Website more relevant to your interests.\nIf you block these cookies, we will be unable to improve the experience our users get from our website.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Advertising: these collect information about your visit to this Website, such as what you have looked at and the links you have followed, so that we can target our advertising at you, or exclude certain types of advertising that would not interest you.\nWe can also gather information about your browser, device and your IP address.\nIf you block these cookies, you may receive advertising that is not relevant to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Third party cookies: these are used where we use third-party applications on the Website to customise the services that we provide, or to provide an increased functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following sets out how we use cookies in more detail:</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies for measuring performance of the website</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By understanding how people use the Xapo website, we can make improvements to the navigation and content to make the site better and easier to access.</p>\n<p>We use cookies that allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it.\nThis helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</p>\n<p>We use Unbounce cookies to collect information about how visitors interact with our site and landing pages.\nWe use the information to compile reports and run A/B tests to determine which landing pages a visitor has visited and how they use our site.\nThe cookies collect information in an anonymous form.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: \"ubpv\"</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;Identifies which page variant the visitor was first routed to.\nThis way, the returning visitor will see the same variant, and will not be rerouted to a random one.</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;184 days.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:\"ubvs\" </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose: Provides the page visitor with a consistent experience upon returning to a landing page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;180 days</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: \"ubvt\" </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;Essential to external conversion tracking.</p>\n<p>This cookie identifies the visitor so conversions across subdomains can be recorded, primarily on pages where our external tracking script is installed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;72 hours</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:\"ubrs\" </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose: Identifies which variant will be selected for each visitor.\nPossible values include serving the visitor the same landing page that they initially requested on subsequent visits, or indicating visitor routing based on variant weights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;This cookie expires when the visitor's browser session is closed.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: \"ub_tracking_id\" </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose: Provides the page visitor with a consistent experience upon returning to an AMP page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;1 year</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: \"_sp_ses.\" </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose: Differentiates between different visits (i.e., how many times the user has visited the landing page).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;30 minutes</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: \"_sp_id.\" </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose: Identifies a visitor\u2019s activity on the domain between sessions.\nPossible values include the following: how many times the visitor accessed the domain, timestamp of the visitor\u2019s first, last, and current visit, and the ID of the visitor and their current session.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Expires: 2 years</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We also use Hotjar to gather data on where users are clicking on pages and how they are viewing single and multiple pages.\nWe use the information to compile reports and to help us improve the website.\nThe cookies collect information in an anonymous form.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: _hjid</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;Hotjar cookie.\nSet when the customer first lands on a page with the Hotjar script.\nIt is used to persist the Hotjar User ID, unique to that site on the browser.\nThis ensures that behavior in subsequent visits to the same site will be attributed to the same user ID.</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;365 days</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: _hjRecordingLastActivity</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;This should be found in Session storage (as opposed to cookies).\nThis gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;This cookie expires when the visitor's browser session is closed.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: _hjAbsoluteSessionInProgress</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;This cookie is used to detect the first pageview session of a user.\nThis is a True/False flag set by the cookie.</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;This cookie expires when the visitor's browser session is closed.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: _hjFirstSeen</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;This is set to identify a new user\u2019s first session.\nIt stores a true/false value, indicating whether this was the first time Hotjar saw this user.\nIt is used by Recording filters to identify new user sessions.</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;This cookie expires when the visitor's browser session is closed.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name: _hjRecordingEnabled</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Purpose:&nbsp;This is added when a Recording starts and is read when the recording module is initialized to see if the user is already in a recording in a particular session.</p>\n<p>Expires:&nbsp;This cookie expires when the visitor's browser session is closed.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For how long do our cookies last?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The cookies we use last for different lengths of time.\nThis depends upon the purpose for which they are used.</p>\n<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies which are stored only until you leave the Website, or you close your web browser.</p>\n<p>Persistent cookies last for a fixed period of time, defined within the cookie, and allow the Website to recognise the device again when the user returns to that website on that device.</p>\n<p>Last Updated: March 19th, 2021.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<strong>\u00a9 Xapo Holdings Limited 2021.\nAll Rights Reserved.</strong>\n</strong>\n</p> ", "created_at":
