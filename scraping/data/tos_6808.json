ensure that you do not include any personal information beyond what we have requested in any online inquiries or correspondence.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Images stored and processed.</em>\n</strong> When you capture images using a Matterport camera or other devices, or if you provide images from any other source and upload them to the Matterport Cloud (as described in the Matterport Cloud Subscription Agreement), we may collect personal information which is depicted within the imagery you submit.&nbsp;</p> Automatically collected information <p>\n<em>\n<strong>URL, IP addresses, Device Information and Frequency of Use.</strong>\n</em> Like many other online service providers, we collect and analyze information about our users\u2019 utilization and navigation of our Services.\nThis information helps us to design our Services to better suit our users\u2019 needs, and we also use this information to share aggregated, anonymous information on the effectiveness of our Services with content owners and creators.\nThis information is collected automatically and &nbsp;may include the URL you came from prior to using the Services, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) of your computer or mobile device, the type, and version of the internet browser you are using, the make, OS model and unique identifier of your computer or mobile device, and your usage patterns associated with the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Location data.</strong>\n</em> When you use a Matterport camera in conjunction with our mobile applications your current location may be

your IP address information to determine your approximate location.\nThe mobile device OS will always prompt you for permission to use location data and we do not bypass this OS provided permission functionality in our mobile applications.</p> Information from other sources <p>We may receive information about you, including personal information, from third parties, and may combine this information with other personal information we maintain about you.\nIf we do so, this Privacy Policy governs any combined information that we maintain in a personally-identifiable format.</p> Cookies and similar technologies <p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer or mobile devices by saving your information such as user ID and other preferences.\nCookies are either deleted from your computer or mobile device at the end of every session or are maintained for a longer period of time.\nAs a result, we use cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Service and this

to Matterport Cloud and to protect your account.\nWe also use cookies for analytical purposes to better understand how you use the Services and to deliver the best user experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also,

We use this information to facilitate transactions, detect and prevent fraud and keep a record of your purchases so we can provide you Customer Support and warranty services, and for financial purposes as required by law.\nWe do not process your credit card information directly, but rather this information is processed by one or more 3rd-party payment processors.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Online Inquiries and Correspondence.</strong>\n</em> We use the personal information you provide so we may communicate with you regarding your inquiry and to satisfy other requests.\nIf you provide your phone number, we may use that information to make direct dial calls, autodialed and prerecorded message calls, and to send text messages, from Matterport relating to our products and services.\nIf you correspond with us via email or by written mail, we may store the information you submit in a manner specific to you, for example in an electronic file

to.\nAdditionally, we use this information in an aggregated form for analytics and machine learning, but the results of these activities do not contain or disclose any personal information that is identifiable to you.\nIf you captured personal information in images that you have uploaded to Matterport Cloud this information may be publicly displayed if you choose to display the underlying imagery publicly through the Service.\nIf you do not wish to publicly display personal information depicted in the images you submit, you should either refrain from capturing such personal information in your images or designate the resulting 3D models as \u201cprivate\u201d in your Matterport Cloud account.\nFor additional information on designating your imagery as \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d, restricting third parties from editing or re-sharing your imagery, and the consequences of archiving your imagery, deleting your imagery and/or terminating your account, please

Service.\nWe also use location data to assist the processing of image data and to better understand how multiple scan locations are related to each other.\nWe also use location data to provide aggregated analytics to better understand how and where the Service is being used, to provide a customized and localized experience when using the Service, and to prevent access to the Services where required by law.&nbsp;</p> Legal basis for processing in the EU &nbsp.\n<p>If you are a resident in the EU, we need to tell you the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal

incentives related to the personal information you provide that can result in different prices, rates and quality levels.\nSuch financial incentives will be reasonably related to the value of the
