any ownership or licensed rights (including intellectual property rights) you may have in content posted to your hosted websites.\nGenerally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You shall be solely responsible for any and all of your User Content or User Content that is submitted through your Account, and the consequences of, and requirements for, distributing it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Respect to User Submissions.\nYou

anyone else for any intentional or unintentional use of your User Submissions.\n</li>\n<li>\nISODME may be working on the same or similar content, it may already know of such content from other sources, it may simply wish to develop this (or similar) content on its own, or it may have taken / will take some other action.\n</li>\n<li>\nISODME shall own exclusive rights (including all intellectual property and other proprietary rights) to any User Submissions posted to this Site, and shall be entitled to the unrestricted use and dissemination of any User Submissions posted to this

11.\nBACKUPS <p>While we do have weekly backups, these are solely for acts of god.\nFor instance, if our server goes down, we still have a backup from the week before.\nBeing a user, you cannot access these.\nWe do not warrant that we conduct these, as sometimes there are higher priorities and if our servers are in operational state, the backups will not be taken.\n<br>Thus, it is extremely important that you conduct weekly backups of your own data as well for your own use.\n</p> 12.\nMONITORING OF CONTENT AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION <p>ISODME generally does not pre-screen User Content (whether posted to a website hosted by ISODME or posted to this Site).\nHowever, ISODME reserves the right (but undertakes no duty) to do so and decide whether any item of User Content is appropriate and/or complies with this Agreement.\nISODME may remove any item of User Content (whether posted to a website hosted by ISODME or posted to this Site) and/or terminate a User\u2019s access to this Site or the Services found at this Site for posting or publishing any material in violation of this Agreement, or for otherwise violating this Agreement (as determined by ISODME in its sole and absolute discretion), at any time and without prior notice.\nISODME may also terminate a User\u2019s access to this Site or the Services found at this Site if ISODME has reason to believe the User is a repeat offender.\nIf ISODME terminates your access to this Site or the Services found at this Site, ISODME may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove and destroy any data and files stored by you on its servers.</p> 13.\nADDITIONAL RESERVATION OF RIGHTS <p>ISODME expressly reserves the right to deny, cancel, terminate, suspend, lock, or modify access to (or control of) any Account or
