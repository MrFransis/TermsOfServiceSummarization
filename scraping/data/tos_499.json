costs arising therefrom, including bank charges related to any debit entries or similar charges.\nRuntastic may deliver invoices and payment reminders to the user by email.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Automatic Renewal.</u> When your Subscription period expires, your credit card will be charged automatically with the standard subscription price which

least prior to the expiration of your current Subscription.\nThe standard subscription price can be viewed on the Platform and in the App Stores.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Cancellation.</u> You may

period.\nEach user can check the length of the current Subscription period by viewing such user\u2019s account information.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Contact.</u> Please contact us for any questions

device.\n<br> 2.\nRuntastic will not update the App during this period.\nThis means that if the operating system of your device is updated or if other relevant third party technical services change during this period, it may not be possible to use the App any longer.\nRuntastic assumes no liability for this.\n<br> If you have purchased your Premium Membership through an App that will be discontinued, your Subscription will not be automatically renewed and will expire at the end of your current Subscription.\nIf you have purchased your Premium Membership through another App - that will not be discontinued - automatic renewal as described in Section 6.4 shall still occur.\nSubject to the two limitations as described above, only if Runtastic cannot provide the possibility for you to use the App until your current Subscription period has ended, are you entitled to a pro rata refund of the payment for the current Subscription of your Premium Membership.\nIf this occurs, you can contact Runtastic (see Section 6.7) to claim your refund.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Notice.</u> Runtastic may give notice as mentioned under Section 7.1 by informing you either by email or through
