consultations between you and us, which consultations will be initiated upon written notice by any party to the other (the \"Consultation Notice\").\nThe Consultation Notice must describe the nature and basis of the Claim and set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf such Claim cannot be resolved within thirty (30) days after the Consultation Notice is received, any party to the consultations may initiate an arbitration proceeding upon written notice to the other party in accordance with this Section 2.\nAny notice to us under this Section 2 should be addressed to: compliance@everquote.com (\"Notice Address\").<strong>You agree to arbitrate all Claims between you and us, or any Provider, that cannot be amicably resolved in accordance with the foregoing paragraph.</strong> This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to: (a) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of your relationship with us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\nand (b) claims that could be alleged as class action Claims (and you agree to waive the right to participate in a class action in accordance with this Section 2).\nFor the avoidance of doubt, references in this Section 2 to \"Site operator,\" \"Provider,\" \"we\", \"Prospect\", \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the services, information or Site Content available through the use the Site.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing an individual action in small claims court if your claims qualify, and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.\nFurther, this arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission or the Federal Trade Commission.\nYou agree that, by entering into this arbitration agreement, you and we are each waiving our respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action, and that arbitration of disputes pursuant to this Section 2 shall be in your individual capacity.\nTHIS MEANS YOU ARE LIMITING YOUR RIGHT TO APPEAL AND ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A COURT ACTION.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE, COMBINE, OR JOIN THE CLAIMS OF OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY BE SIMILARLY SITUATED OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its then-prevailing rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by this Agreement (but expressly excluding the Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitration and any other AAA Rules that conflict with the waiver of class arbitration and representative proceedings below), and will be administered by one (1) arbitrator with relevant industry experience appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules.\nThe AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling (800) 778-7879.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement and shall apply Delaware law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, without limitation, issues relating to the applicability and enforceability of this arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties to the arbitration, any arbitration hearings under this Section 2 will take place in the county where you are domiciled.\nIf your Claim is for $5,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your Claim exceeds $5,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nExcept as otherwise provided for in this Section 2, in any arbitration between you and us under this Section 2, all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above where Claims for damages do not exceed $10,000 shall, at your written request, be paid by us.\nAny request for payment of fees by us shall be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your demand for arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other Users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same User to the extent required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>With the exception of the provision in the preceding paragraph prohibiting class arbitration or representative proceedings, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 2 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 2 shall still apply to the maximum extent possible.\nIn the event that the foregoing prohibition on class arbitration or representative proceedings is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 2 shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the Terms, including, without limitation, Section 16 (Choice of Law and Forum), will remain in force.</p>\n<p>You may opt-out of this arbitration provision only by written notice to us at the Notice Address (compliance@everquote.com) within thirty (30) days of your acceptance of this agreement, which notice shall include your name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration.</p>\n<p>If we make any change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the term of your relationship with us, that change shall not apply to any Claim against us initiated prior to the effective date of the change.\nThe change shall apply to all other Claims that have arisen or may arise between you and us.\nWe will notify you of changes to this arbitration provision by posting the amended terms on the Site or by email, in each case at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, Providers shall be third party beneficiaries of the rights to dispute resolution and arbitration set forth in this Section 2, and each Provider shall have the right to enforce this Section 2 against Users as if such Provider were a party to the agreement set forth in this Section 2 in the event of any dispute or claim between you and such Provider based on or relating to any transaction or interaction between you and such Provider that is enabled by or arises in connection with your use of the Site.</p>\n<p>DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISIONS.</p> 3.\nPersonal Use\n<p>We do not
