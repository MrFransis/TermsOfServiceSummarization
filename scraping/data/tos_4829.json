unless or until you cancel your\nmembership or your Brigit User Account is otherwise terminated.\nUpcoming\ndates upon which you will be charged for subsequent Membership Fees will\nalso be displayed

overdraft will not occur.</p>\n<p>The Membership Fee may be discounted from time to time by our customer\nservice team, or through partnerships with affiliates.\nIf you receive a\ndiscounted price on

credit your Payment Method to correct\nerroneous debits and credits.\nYou have the right to receive notice of\nany debit for the Membership Fee that would vary in amount from a\nprevious Membership Fee, but you agree that we only need to notify you\nin advance if a particular debit from your Payment Method would be more\nthan $9.99.\n(Our policy is that no single debit will exceed $9.99, so\nwe

debit\ntransaction from your Bank Account or debit card if any of the\ninformation relied upon in your request to stop payment is incorrect or\nincomplete.\nIf you have followed the instructions in this section to\nnotify Brigit of your desire to revoke your authorization at least three\n(3) business days before the scheduled debit date, Brigit will be liable\nfor your losses or damages directly

arising as initial claims,\ncounter\u2010claims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise.\nPlease note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims\ncourt, if your Claims qualify and

shall be determined in accordance with, the rules and\npolicies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the\nrules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any countervailing\nlaw.\nIf you have any questions concerning the AAA or would like to\nobtain a copy of the AAA arbitration rules, you may call&nbsp;1(800)\n778-7879 or visit the AAA's web site at: www.adr.org.\nIf you

to.</p>\n20.6.\nArbitration Fees.\n<p>If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all the\nadministrator's filing costs and administrative fees (other than\nhearing fees).\nIf you elect arbitration, filing costs and\nadministrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in\naccordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in\naccordance with countervailing law if contrary to the\nadministrator's rules.\nWe shall pay the administrator's hearing\nfees for one full day of arbitration hearings.\nFees for hearings\nthat exceed one day will be paid by the party requesting the\nhearing, unless the administrator's rules or applicable law require\notherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so.\nEach party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys' fees,\nexcept as otherwise provided by law.\nIf a statute gives you the\nright to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall\napply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the

according to the rules of the arbitrator\nadministrator.\nIn the event of such an appeal, any opposing party\nmay cross-appeal within&nbsp;30&nbsp;days after notice of the appeal.\nThe\npanel will

arbitration may join,\nconsolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or\nmore individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same\narbitration unless those persons are parties to a single\ntransaction.\nUnless consented to in writing by all parties to the\narbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and\nobligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the\nclaims in arbitration, and shall not (a)&nbsp;determine the rights,\nobligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or\nresolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party.\nnor (b)&nbsp;make\nan award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named\nparty.\nNo administrator or arbitrator shall have the power or\nauthority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this Section 20.8,\nand any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration\ndecision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable.\nAny\nchallenge to the validity of this Section 20.8&nbsp;shall be determined\nexclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any\narbitrator.</p>\n20.9.\nSurvival and Severability of Arbitration Provision.\n<p>This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of this\nAgreement.\nIf any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than\nsection&nbsp;20.8&nbsp;is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining\nportions of this Arbitration Provision shall nevertheless remain\nvalid and in force.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that\napplicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision's\nlimitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term,\nthen that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that\nterm) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be\nbrought in court.\nIf an arbitration is brought on a class,\nrepresentative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such\nproceedings in section&nbsp;20.8&nbsp;are finally adjudicated pursuant to the\nlast sentence of section&nbsp;20.8 to be unenforceable, then no\narbitration shall be had.\nIn no event shall any invalidation be\ndeemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards\nbeyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.</p>\n20.10.\nJudicial Forum for Claims.\n<p>Except as otherwise required by\napplicable law or governing loan agreement, in the event that this\nArbitration Provision is found not to apply to you or your Claim,\nyou and Brigit agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small\nclaims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of\nNew York, New York.\nBoth you and Brigit consent to venue and\npersonal jurisdiction there.\nWe both agree to waive our right to a\njury trial.</p>\n20.11.\nWAIVER OF RIGHT TO LITIGATE.\n<p>THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY\nHAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR\nJURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION\nPURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY\nAND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A\nCOURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY ANY\nPARTY.</p>\n21.\nGoverning Law and Venue\n<p>Except for Section 20 which is governed by the FAA, and the Credit\nBuilder, this Agreement and all Claims are governed by the laws of the\nState of

Disclosures\n<p>The below are disclosures related to information that we may collect, use, or disclose outside of the context of U.S.\nfinancial information laws.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Contact Information</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may collect your contact information, to the extent you provide it to us, such as by signing up for a blog post, emailing us, or otherwise submitting an inquiry to us via our Website or Services.\nWe use service providers to assist in our customer support and mailing communications, such as Zendesk and MailChimp, respectively.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Brigit uses \u201ccookies\u201d and similar technologies (e.g., pixel tags, SDKs) to track your use of the Website and Services.\nThese technologies collect information in relation to your experience on our Website and Services, such as pages clicked, navigation path, bounce rates, actions taken (typically called \u201cevents\u201d), and other metrics.</p>\n<p>We and our vendors use these technologies to optimize our Website and Services and understand user engagement in relation thereto.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What Are Cookies?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Essentially, cookies are small files that are stored within your browser and store data in relation to your visit to our Website or Services.</p>\n<p>Cookies serve a variety of purposes, such as securely maintaining your authenticated session and preferences (e.g., remembering log-in details or other settings), understanding your use of the Website or Services, and servings ads (whether our own ads on third-party websites or services or others\u2019 ads on our Website or Services) based on your interests or actions.\nEach cookie typically has a pseudonymous ID associated with them (a set of randomized characters, typically alphanumeric) and may also store information related to your device or browser, such as IP address, browser and Operating System type, device type, etc.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What Are \u201cPixel Tags\u201d?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Essentially, pixel tags are small pieces of JavaScript in a webpage or email used to (a) store the cookies mentioned above and (b) track when the page or email has been viewed.\nThe mobile app equivalent could be considered an \u201cSDK\u201d (software development kit).\nWe will refer to either as pixel tags for purposes of simplicity.</p>\n<p>With respect to (a) above, pixel tags often create the cookies that are stored on your browser.\nThen, when you revisit a site, the pixel tag will recognize such cookie and \u201cread\u201d the information stored within, typically sending it to the server (typically either Brigit\u2019s or a third-party vendors, depending on whose pixel it belongs to).</p>\n<p>Relatedly, with respect to (b) above, pixels will often send data to a server (again, typically depending on whose pixel it belongs to) when a set of user-initiated \u201cevents\u201d occur, such as clicking on an ad, a button on the Website, a link in an email (or the fact that you opened the email), or other information related to your browser or device, such as a device identifier or other information similar to what is described in the <em>\u201cWhat Are Cookies?\u201d</em> section above.\nWe may have access to this data via dashboards or APIs.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Opt-Out</em>\n</p>\n<p>Most Internet browsers are set up to accept cookies automatically.\nYou can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, allowing you to decide whether or not to accept those cookies, block all third-party cookies (cookies dropped by third-party vendors), or all cookies generally (both Brigit\u2019s and third-party vendors\u2019 cookies).\nUsers choosing not to accept any cookies or similar technologies may not be able to take full advantage of the Website or Services.</p>\n<p>Brigit uses services such as Google Analytics, Segment, Facebook Analytics, Hotjar, Bing Ads, and Snap Pixel to carry out the types of activities described above (e.g., advertising and analytics).\nTo opt out of interest-based advertising (IBA), you could visit one of the following websites, to the extent that a third-party partner participates in such industry self-regulatory frameworks: Ad Choices Opt-Out Page.\nFurther, you may want to visit the websites of our partners, which may provide an opt-out for any tracking over time and across third-party websites.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Server Logs</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Like most websites today, our servers may keep log files that record data each time a device accesses our Website or Services.\nThe log files may contain data about the nature of such access, including the device\u2019s IP address, user agent string (e.g., operating system and browser type/version), and referral URL (i.e., the external source by which you arrived at our Websites or Services, or the pages you\u2019ve clicked on while on our Websites or Services).\nWe may use these log files for purposes such as assisting in monitoring and troubleshooting errors and incidents, analyzing web traffic, or optimizing the user experience.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Marketing Communications</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You can manage your receipt of marketing communications by clicking on the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d (or similar) link located on the bottom of an applicable Brigit marketing email and following the instructions found on any page to which the link may take you.\nNote, however, that you cannot opt-out of transactional or administrative emails.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Retention</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Brigit retains your personal information for as long as it is deemed necessary and relevant by Brigit for Brigit\u2019s operations unless a longer or different retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Your California Privacy Rights</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cDo Not Track\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals or similar mechanisms at this time.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Other Disclosures</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the purposes described above, we may collect, use, or transfer your information (a) as part of, or during negotiations of, a merger, consolidation, sale of our assets, as well as equity financing, acquisition, strategic alliance or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of Brigit, (b) for purposes of responding to requests by law enforcement, regulators, and other government bodies, (c) in aggregated or anonymized fashion for further analysis and optimization of the Website or Services, (d) for our everyday businesses purposes, or (e) as otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<b>Got Questions?</b>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, or if you have any questions or suggestions, please contact
