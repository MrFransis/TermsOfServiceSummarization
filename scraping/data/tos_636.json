AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nAgreement to Arbitrate</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Use as the \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Y Combinator, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Use (including any alleged breach thereof), the Site, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\nYou agree that, by entering into this Terms of Use, you and Y Combinator are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nYour rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<strong>YOU AND Y COMBINATOR AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND Y COMBINATOR AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).</strong>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nPre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Y Combinator is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user\u2019s satisfaction by emailing us at yclegal@ycombinator.com.\nIf such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to Y Combinator should be sent to Y Combinator Management, LLC, 335 Pioneer Way, Mountain View, CA 94041 Attention General Counsel (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.\nIf Y Combinator and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Y Combinator may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Y Combinator or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Y Combinator is entitled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d.\nArbitration Procedures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (\u201cAAA\u201d) rules and procedures (collectively, the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nFor information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.\nIf there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.\nAlthough arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Use and applicable law.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>\n<p>Unless Y Combinator and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, Y Combinator agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e.\nCosts of Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>f.\nConfidentiality</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>g.\nSeverability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.\nIf a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the Terms of Use will continue to apply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>h.\nFuture Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Use to the contrary, Y Combinator agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Site, you may reject any such change by sending Y Combinator written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>Termination</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that Y Combinator, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Site and remove and discard any content within the Site, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Y Combinator believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use.\nAny suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Site, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nY Combinator may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Site, or any part thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that any termination of

will not terminate Y Combinator\u2019s rights to your User Content.\nFurther, you agree that Y Combinator will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Site.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>User Disputes</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Site and Y Combinator will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.\nY Combinator reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Site.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>\n<strong>General</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Y Combinator and govern your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements between you and Y Combinator with respect to the Site.\nThese Terms of Use will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
