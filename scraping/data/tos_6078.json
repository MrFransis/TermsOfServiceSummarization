any claims you may have for the applicable Reward.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, you expressly agree to release us and hold us harmless against any claim for any unpaid Rewards where the applicable Company has failed to provide the Reward to us.</li>\n<li>Where the applicable Company administers its own Reward program and provides Rewards directly to you, you agree that Company is solely responsible for such Reward and Company alone (and not ProductReportCard.com, LLC) is liable for any failure to pay such Reward or remit such reward in a timely manner.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, you expressly agree to release us and hold us harmless against any claim for any unpaid Rewards where the applicable Company fails to provide the Reward to you.<br> You must complete the survey in full to receive the Reward amount.\nFor Rewards administered by us, you must earn the minimum amount of Rewards required to make a redemption stated on the Website, as such may be amended from time to time.\nTo redeem your Rewards, you may access the \u2018Rewards\u2019 area of the Website.\nSelect the desired redemption option from those listed on the site and follow the instructions given to process your Reward.\nThe rewards represented in the \u2018Rewards\u2019 area of the Website and the minimum redemption amount are subject to change by ProductReportCard.com, LLC at any time without prior notice.\nRewards earned from participating in surveys are valid for one year from the award date.\nIf unused on the 366th day after being deposited into your Member Account, your reward will expire and be removed from your Member Account Balance.\nFor example, if you are awarded $5.00 on January 15, 2019 and by January 16, 2020, the expired $5.00 reward will be removed from your Member Account leaving a balance of $0.00.\nProductReportCard.com, LLC will redeem rewards from your Member Account based upon the award date.\nYour \u201coldest\u201d Reward funds will be deducted first, leaving your most recently earned Rewards in your Member Account.\n</li>\n</ol> 8.\nThird-Party Rewards Partners <p>Rewards are provided by third party Rewards Partners and are subject solely to rules and restrictions imposed by such Rewards Partners with respect to usage requirements, restrictions on use, inactivity fees or expiration dates.\nAll rewards are paid via Amazon.com gift cards and are issued as of the day upon which you redeem your Rewards and not the day you earn your Rewards.\nWe do not have control over Amazon\u2019s gift card management or services, and ProductReportCard.com, LLC assumes no liability, obligation or responsibility for, and makes no warranty with respect to, any restrictions, rules or policies that may be applicable to Amazon.com gift cards.\nFor example, if you earn Rewards on January 1, 2020 and redeem your Amazon.com gift card on May 1, 2020, then: (a) Amazon.com is solely responsible for the rules, policies and restrictions governing such gift card.\n(b) the applicable date for determining the issuance of the reward is May 1, 2020, with respect to calculating expiration dates.</p> 9.\nMember Conduct <p>You agree not to use
