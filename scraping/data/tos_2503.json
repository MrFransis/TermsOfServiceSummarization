We are committed to providing you the best online shopping and delivery experience possible.\nThis Privacy Policy explains what information we (Maplebear Inc.\nd/b/a Instacart) collect, how that information is used, under what circumstances we share information, and the choices you can make about that information.\nThis Privacy Policy applies whether you access the Instacart Services (as defined in the Terms of Service) through a browser, a mobile application, or any other method.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis Privacy Policy also describes how we collect, use and disclose your personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d), including personally identifiable health or medical information (\u201cPersonal Health Information\u201d or \u201cPHI\u201d).\nPII is information about you that may be used to identify you (such as your name, phone number, or address).\nPersonal Health Information is PII combined with information that relates to (a) your past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition, (b) the provision of health care to you, or (c) your past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care.\n</p>\n<em>Additional Disclosures:</em>\n<p>\nWe may provide different or additional disclosures relating to the processing of personal information about residents of certain countries, regions or states.\nListed below are additional disclosures that may be applicable to you.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you are a California resident, please see the additional privacy disclosures below in\nDisclosure For California Residents.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you are a Nevada resident, please see the additional privacy disclosures below in\nDisclosure For Nevada Residents.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you are a resident of Canada, please see the additional privacy disclosures in\nDisclosure For Canada Residents.\n</li>\n</ul> II.\nInformation we collect 1.\n<em>Information you provide to us or allow others to provide to us</em>\n<p>\nAt various points in the Instacart experience, you may provide us with information about yourself.\nFor example, when you create an account through the Services, you provide us with personal information like your name, email address, and zip or postal code.\nAnd if you place an order through the Services, we collect information including your address, phone number, birth date, driver\u2019s license expiration date (for alcohol orders or prescription delivery, where available), credit card information, vehicle license plate number(s) (for curbside pickup orders) and the details of your order.\nYour account information may be updated or corrected by accessing your account settings.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you use the Services for prescription delivery (where available), the third-party pharmacy processing your prescription will provide us with your name, address, email address, birth date, phone number, the total amount being charged to you for the prescription drug product(s), and sales tax information for the prescription drug product(s) (if applicable).\nThe third-party pharmacy will also share whether or not the prescription drug product you have ordered requires temperature control.\nIf a prescription drug product delivered to you through the Services has been recalled, the third-party pharmacy will share your name, email address, the date of the prescription drug product order, and the total amount to be refunded to you with Instacart.\nThe pharmacy will not disclose to us the name, quantity, manufacturer or distributor of the prescription drug you have ordered or any other PHI about you other than your status as a patient of the pharmacy.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe may also collect health information you provide directly to us regarding an experience with a retail partner that may require us to contact that retailer, or other retailer partners, for public health or safety reasons, or to facilitate a refund.\nWe do not share your identity with the retailers that we may contact in such a capacity, but may share date, time and location of a transaction, which may allow a retailer to independently identify you.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you log into the Services through a third-party service, both we and that third-party may receive some information about you and your use of the services.\nFor example, if you choose to log into the Services with your Facebook account, we may receive information from Facebook, such as your name, e-mail address, public profile information, and information about your contacts.\nWe may also offer social sharing tools (such as the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d button) that let you share actions on the Services with other websites and vice versa.\nIn those cases, the providers of those tools may receive information about you when you use those tools.\nYou should check the privacy policies of these third-party services and your settings there for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you wish to invite your friends and contacts to use the Services, we will give you the option of either entering in their contact information manually or, for United States residents, importing it from your address books on other third-party services.\nIn both cases, we will store this information for the sole purposes of allowing you to send your friends referral offers, for determining whether your friends use the Services after a referral is sent, and, for United States residents, to remind your friends of the referral sent on your behalf.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur partners may let us collect information about use of their sites/apps or share such information with us.\nFor example, if you use an Instacart button or widget on another site or app, we may receive information about your use of that button or widget and the third-party site/app.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nCommunity Affairs: Instacart is active in local communities as part of our mission to create a world where everyone has access to the food they love and more time to enjoy it together.\nYou may provide us your information in connection with our community affairs efforts.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nLocation Information: When you use the Services, we may collect precise location data.&nbsp;For instance, if&nbsp;you allow the Services to access location services through the permission system used by your device's mobile operating system&nbsp;or browser, we may&nbsp;collect the precise location of your device.\nWe use your location information to facilitate the prompt hand-off of pickup orders (where available), to assist you in finding nearby stores for which pickup or delivery are available,&nbsp;for other similar purposes and&nbsp;for analytics purposes.\nYou can choose whether or not to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on your device&nbsp;or browser,&nbsp;or when prompted by the Instacart mobile app.&nbsp;We may also infer your general location information, for example by using your internet protocol (IP) address.\n<p>\n</p> 2.\n<em>Technical information about usage of the Services</em>\n<p>\nWhen you use the Services, or browse our sites, either through a browser or mobile app, we automatically receive some technical information about the hardware and software that is being used.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nCookies, Pixels, and Other Tracking Technologies: We, our partners, our advertisers, and

may use these technologies to collect information about your online activity over time and across different websites or online services.\nBy using your browser settings, you may block cookies or adjust settings for notifications when a cookie is set.\nYour browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal to online services you visit.\nNote, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals.\nAccordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals.\nFor more information on \u201cDo Not Track,\u201d visit\nhttp://www.allaboutdnt.com\n.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe employ some third-party services to help us understand the usage of the Services and the performance of advertising, and these third parties may also deploy cookies, pixels, or other identifiers on the Services or collect information through our mobile applications.\nFor example, we use Google Analytics to understand, in a non-personally identifying way, how users interact with various portions of the Services -- you can&nbsp;learn more about information that Google may collect here.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Log information:\nWhen you use the Services, or browse our sites, our servers will record information about your usage of the Services and information that is sent by your browser or device.\nLog information can include things like the IP address of your device, information about the browser, operating system

are logged into the Services, this information is stored with your account information.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Interest-Based or Online Behavioral Advertising:\nInstacart may use third-party advertising companies to serve interest-based advertisements to you.\nThese companies compile information from various online sources (including mobile-enabled browsers and applications) to match you with ads that will be the most relevant, interesting, and timely for you.\nIf you would like to opt-out of interest-based advertising, please visit\nhttp://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/\n.\nPlease note that you will be opted out of all interest-based advertising from all business members of the Network Advertising Initiative for that specific browser on that specific device.\nIf you opt-out, you may continue to see Instacart\u2019s or our partners\u2019 online advertisements.\nhowever, these ads will not be as relevant to you.\n<p>\n</p> 3.\n<em>Children</em>\n<p>\nOur Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information (as defined by the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, or \u201cCOPPA\u201d) in a manner not permitted by COPPA.\nIf we obtain actual knowledge that any information we collect has been provided by a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information to the extent required by applicable laws.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe do not knowingly \u201csell,\u201d as that term is defined under the California Consumer Protect Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents.\n</p> III.\nHow we use your information <p>\nWe may use the information we collect for various purposes, including to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide the Services to you, improve the quality of the service, and develop new products and services</li>\n<li>Allow your Personal Shopper (which means those that shop for and/or deliver the order for you, including our

comprise a platform that presents you with a set of one or more retailer virtual storefronts from which you can select goods for picking, packing, and delivery by individual Personal Shopper(s) to your location or, if available, for you to pick up in-store.\nIn order to make this work, we need to share information about you and your order with the other parties who help enable the service.\nThis includes, for example, the Personal Shopper(s) who pick and deliver your order, the payment processing partner(s) that we use to validate and charge your credit card, and the retail partner(s) from which you are purchasing goods.\nTo be clear, only our payment processing partner(s) receive credit card information.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe also share information under the following principles:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>With your consent or at your direction</em>\n\u2014 We will share your information with entities outside of the Services when we have your consent to do so or it is done at your direction.\nFor example:\n<ul>\n<li>If you enter loyalty card information from a particular retailer, we share that information with the retailer you chose along with your order so that information can be added to your loyalty card account.</li>\n<li>If you share a recipe publicly on the Services, it is viewable by anyone along with your first name and last initial.</li>\n<li>If you invite friends to use the Services through our referral program or to share a shopping cart, we will share some information with the friends you invite like your name and picture.\nLikewise, if you choose to join someone else\u2019s cart, they will see some of your information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>With our retail partners</em>\n\u2014 We may share your information with our retail partners in order to provide and maintain the Services.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>For external processing or service provision</em>\n\u2014 We sometimes share information with third parties to process information on our behalf or to otherwise provide certain services (such as delivery services, advertising services, or information to better tailor our services to you).\nFor the purposes of this processing or provision of services, we may share your information with such third parties under appropriate confidentiality provisions.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>For legal purposes</em>\n\u2014 We may share your information when we believe that the disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or requests from law enforcement or regulatory authorities, (b) prevent, detect, or otherwise handle fraud, security, or technical issues, and (c) protect the safety, rights, or property of any person, the public, or Instacart.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>On a non-personal or aggregate basis</em>\n\u2014 We share information on both a non-personally identifying basis (including, but not limited to, order and delivery details but not including credit card information) or an aggregate basis.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>To enable purchase of alcohol&nbsp;(not available in all jurisdictions)</em>\n\u2014 When you buy alcohol using the Services, we may be required by law to share certain information with the retailer who makes the sale.\nThis information could include, among other things, the names and addresses of the purchaser and recipient, government issued ID information, the quantity, brand, price, proof, and volume of alcohol purchased, and a recipient signature.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>For business purposes</em>\n\u2014 We may share your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.\nWe may also share your information between and among Instacart, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.\n</li>\n</ul> V.\nPersonal Health Information <p>\nThis Section (Personal Health Information) governs our use and disclosure of your Personal Health Information.\nIf there is a conflict between the terms of this Section and any other terms of this Privacy Policy or the Instacart Terms of Services, the terms in this Section will govern.\nTo the extent we receive, create, maintain, use or disclose any of your PHI, we will maintain the privacy and security of such information as required by the federal patient privacy law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations promulgated under that Act (\"HIPAA\"), as well as any applicable state and other federal privacy policy laws.\n</p>\n<p>\nYour PHI is protected under HIPAA and under certain state laws.\nThose laws give you rights with respect to the access, use, and disclosure of PHI by your health care providers, such as pharmacies, and us.\nWhen you place a pharmacy order using our Services, the pharmacy responds as we have described above under the Section entitled \"Information we collect\" by disclosing to Instacart your status as a patient of the pharmacy.\nInformation concerning your status as a patient of the pharmacy is PHI and protected by HIPAA.\nAs discussed above, no other PHI will be disclosed to us by your pharmacy and no other PHI will be disclosed by Instacart to your personal shopper other than your status as a patient of the pharmacy.\nFor a more complete description of your rights under HIPAA and the uses and disclosures of your PHI, please refer to your pharmacy's Notice of Privacy Practices.\nWe will not disclose your PHI without your prior written consent with other people or non-affiliated companies unless: (i) it is needed to provide our Services, (ii) it has been \"de-identified\" so that it cannot identify you, (ii) we have your prior written consent, (iv) disclosure is required by law, or (v) we are acquired or file for bankruptcy.\n</p> VI.\nSecurity <p>\nWe employ and maintain reasonable administrative, physical, and technical measures designed to safeguard and protect information under our control from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.\nIn addition, when we collect, maintain, access, use, or disclose your PHI, we will do so using systems and processes consistent with information privacy and security requirements under applicable federal and state laws, including, without limitation, HIPAA.\nAll electronic PHI will be encrypted at rest and in transit.\nNevertheless, transmission via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information about you.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will make any legally required notifications of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your PHI or PII, including, without limitation, breaches of your stored PHI or PII (as breaches are defined under applicable state or federal statutes on security breach notification).\nTo the extent permitted by applicable laws, we will make such notifications to you without unreasonable delay, as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.\n</p> VII.\nChanges to this Policy <p>\nThis policy may change from time to time and any revised Privacy Policy will be posted at this page, so we encourage you to review it regularly.\nIf we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy and, in the case of materials changes to the Privacy Policy, we may provide you with additional notice (such as a notice in our user interface or sending you a notification by email).\n</p> VIII.\nDisclosures for Residents of California <p>\nThese additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201c\n<strong>\nCCPA\n</strong>\n\u201d) provides additional

you.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information on our collection practices, including the sources we receive information from, please review \u201c\n<strong>\nInformation We Collect\n</strong>\n\u201d (Section II above).\nWe collect and use these categories of personal information for the business purposes described in \u201c\n<strong>\nHow We Use Your

identity and process your request.\nIf we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests to know or delete.\n</p> C.\nRight to Opt-Out.\n<p>\nWe do not generally sell information as the term \u201csell\u201d is traditionally understood.\nHowever, if and to the extent \u201csale\u201d under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those implemented specifically for interest-based advertising, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.\n</p> D.\nAuthorized Agent.\n<p>\nYou can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf.\nHowever, we will require written proof of the agent\u2019s permission to do so and verify your identity directly.\n</p> E.\nRight to Non-Discrimination.\n<p>\nYou have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any your rights.\n</p> F.\nFinancial Incentives.\n<p>\nFinancial incentives are programs, benefits, or other offerings, including payments to

individual terms.\nFor a list and more details about our promotions and other incentives current at this time, please visit our \u201cTerms of Promos and Credits\u201d page which lists each promotion and links its respective terms here.\nYour intentional participation in any of the programs, benefits, or other offerings under this Section will be interpreted as affirmative consent to the terms of such incentive.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, we offer a referral rewards program to our users who recommend our services to their contacts as prospective customers, when those prospective customers sign up for, and make a purchase using our Services.\nWe generally do not treat consumers differently if they exercise a right under California law.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, discounted prices or rewards will require you to be part of the particular program.\nIn such circumstances, we may offer a price difference because the price is reasonably related to the value of your data.\n</p>

(\u201cInstacart\u201d).\nThis Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (each, hereafter, a \u201cuser\u201d).</p>\n<p>By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and acknowledge and agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with Instacart\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>SECTION 13 (\u201cDISPUTES &amp.\nARBITRATION\u201d) OF THESE TERMS (THE \u201cARBITRATION AGREEMENT\u201d) PROVIDES THAT ANY CLAIMS THAT YOU AND INSTACART HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION.\nUNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF AGAINST INSTACART ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, YOU ALSO WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON YOUR CLAIMS.\nPLEASE SEE SECTION 13 FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND HOW TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>The Services comprise a technology platform that presents you with a set of one or more retailer (each a \u201cRetailer\u201d) virtual storefronts from which you can select goods for picking and packing by one or more personal shoppers and delivery to your location or, if available, for you to pick up in-store.\nDepending on the Retailer from whom you purchase goods through the Services, picking and packing, and delivery services may be performed by third parties, which may include Retailer personnel, independent contractors, and third party logistics providers (collectively, \u201cThird Party Providers\u201d).</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that services provided by Third Party Providers are provided by third-party independent contractors who are not employed by Instacart.\nYou acknowledge that Instacart does not supervise, direct, or control the performance of services provided by Third Party Providers to you or for your benefit.</p>\n<p>When you use the Services to place an order for goods, you authorize the purchase of those goods from the Retailers you

Provider are collectively acting as your agents in the ordering, picking, packing, and/or delivery of goods purchased by you and the Retailer\u2014not the Third Party Provider and not

with Instacart to cover the cost of the goods you have purchased from the retailer and any separate Instacart fees, and your card will be charged for the goods purchased by you and any applicable fees, taxes and/or tips.</p>\n<p>Instacart may change the fees it charges for the Services, including but not limited to Delivery Fees, Service Fees, and Heavy Order Fees.\nYour card will be temporarily authorized for an amount greater than the total amount of the purchase appearing in the original check out.\nThis higher authorized amount will be disclosed during the purchase process and is a temporary authorization charge on your order, to deal with situations where your total purchase amount turns out to be higher than the original amount due to special requests, added items, replacement items or weight adjustments.\nRetailers set the prices of the goods on the Services, and some Retailers may set prices for goods on the Services that are different than in-store prices.\nYou can view each Retailer\u2019s pricing policies on their storefront on both the website and in the Instacart app.</p>\n<p>You also acknowledge and agree that, except as expressly provided

information on the Services that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions that may relate to pricing, product descriptions, promotional offers, and product availability.\nInstacart reserves the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or refuse or cancel orders if any information on the Services is inaccurate at any time without

other electronic notifications.</p> 3.\nInstacart Express <p>Instacart Express is a membership program that waives the delivery fee and reduces certain service fees for scheduled deliveries on orders over $35 with each Retailer placed through the Services for a monthly or yearly subscription fee.\nGenerally, Instacart gift cards and/or credits cannot be used to pay for the Instacart Express subscription fee.\nDeliveries made by Third Party Providers via Instacart Express are subject to availability.\nYou acknowledge that your Instacart Express membership does not entitle you to faster delivery times or priority time slots.\nService fees, special handling fees, and/or taxes may still apply.\nFor combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply.</p>\n<p>UNLESS YOU CANCEL, BY DEFAULT (AND WITH PRIOR NOTICE TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW), YOUR INSTACART EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW, AND THE APPLICABLE MEMBERSHIP FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED TO

period has expired, Instacart will not charge you for the subsequent Instacart Express membership term.\nInstacart may change the monthly or annual fee charged for Instacart Express membership at any time, but any such fee change will not apply to current Instacart Express members until such time as their current memberships expire and their memberships are renewed for another term.</p>\n<p>We may change other terms or conditions applicable to Instacart Express from time to time.\nAny new or renewed Instacart Express memberships will be subject to the terms of service active at that time and displayed when you sign up for Instacart Express.\nInstacart may also make such changes with respect to current Instacart Express memberships.\nIn that case, Instacart will provide you with notice at

membership.</p>\n<p>Your Instacart Express membership cannot be transferred or assigned.\nInstacart reserves the right to accept, refuse, or cancel your Instacart Express membership at any time in its

your relationship or transactions with Instacart as a consumer.</p>\n<p>Before initiating proceedings against Instacart, you agree to contact Instacart first and attempt to work out any such dispute amicably.</p>\n<p>\n<b>For residents of the United States, you agree to the following mandatory arbitration provisions:</b>\n</p>\n<p>Mandatory Arbitration: If we\u2019re unable to work out a solution amicably, both you and Instacart agree to resolve through binding arbitration, rather than in court, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising at any time out of or relating to: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof.\n(ii) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications.\n(iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Services, including any goods or services purchased or sold through, by, or using the Services.\nor (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with Instacart as a consumer.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding this mandatory arbitration provision, (a) you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and (b) you and Instacart each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement of a party\u2019s intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the Effective Date of these Terms.</p>\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(the \u201cFAA\u201d), governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to this Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of the claimant\u2019s state of residence.</p>\n<p>\n<b>TRIAL BY JURY WAIVER:</b> BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND INSTACART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>\n<p>\n<b>CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WAIVER:</b> BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND INSTACART ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO BRING, JOIN, OR PARTICIPATE IN, EITHER AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER, IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nYOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, UNLESS YOU AND INSTACART OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, ANY ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM(S) WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nYOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN YOUR FAVOR AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY YOUR INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), AND ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER INSTACART USERS.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS OR ENGAGE IN ANY CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION.</p>\n<p>Opt-out of Mandatory Arbitration: You can reject and opt-out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by emailing Instacart at arbitration-opt-out@instacart.com with your first and last name and the email address associated with your account and stating your intent to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement.\nNote that opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or in which courts any disputes must be brought.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Except as described below for California residents,</b> the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cRules\u201d) in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made.\nThe Rules are available at www.adr.org.\nIn the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply.</p>\n<p>The Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d) selected in accordance with the Rules.\nThe Arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Instacart.\nThe Arbitrator will have the authority to award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law can award to an individual.\nThe Arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.\nThe Arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding on you and Instacart.</p>\n<p>You and Instacart agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or use the Services, or a location you and Instacart mutually agree upon in writing.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Instacart submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Rules.</p>\n<p>The Rules will govern the payment of all filing, administrative or arbitrator fees (\u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) and each party will be responsible for their own Arbitration Fees under those Rules or to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>For California residents,</b> the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc.\n(\u201cADR Services\u201d) under its Arbitration Rules (the \u201cADR Services Rules\u201d) in effect at the time the arbitration demand is made.\nThe ADR Services Rules are available at: https://www.adrservices.com/services/arbitration-rules/.\nIn the event of any conflict between the ADR Services Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall apply.</p>\n<p>For California residents, the Parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the ADR Services Rules (the \u201cADR Arbitrator\u201d).\nThe ADR Arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Instacart.\nThe ADR Arbitrator will have the authority to award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law can award to an individual.\nThe ADR Arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.\nThe ADR Arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding on you and Instacart.</p>\n<p>For California residents, you and Instacart agree that the ADR Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe ADR Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, or estoppel.</p>\n<p>For California residents, the arbitration will be held in the California county where you live or use the Services, San Francisco, California, or any other location you and Instacart mutually agree upon in writing.</p>\n<p>For California residents, the ADR Services Rules will govern the payment of all filing, administrative or arbitrator fees (\u201cADR Services Arbitration Fees\u201d), but in no event will you be responsible for any portion of those fees in excess of the initial filing fee.\nAfter you pay your portion of any initial filing fee, Instacart shall pay any remaining costs and expenses unique to arbitration, including, without limitation, the arbitrator\u2019s fees and any ADR Services administrative or case management expenses.</p>\n<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall be severed.\nSeverance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, shall have no impact on the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, which shall remain in force, or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class, Collective, Representative Action Waiver above is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction.\nAll other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement shall be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p> 14.\nTermination <p>You can stop using the Services at any time and without notice to us.\nSimilarly, Instacart may terminate access to the Services to you or any other users or stop offering the all or part of the Services at any time without notice.\nIn the event of Termination, Section 1 and Sections 4-17 survive and continue to apply to you.</p> 15.\nControlling Law <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware for residents of the United States and by the laws of the Province of Ontario for residents of Canada (except Quebec), without respect to its conflicts of laws principles, except the Arbitration Agreement, which is governed by the laws outlined in Section 13 of these Terms.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 13 (Disputes &amp.\nArbitration) of these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of New Castle County, Delaware, USA, for the residents of the United States, and the courts of competent jurisdiction in the City of Toronto for residents of Canada (except Quebec), and you and Instacart consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.</p>\n<p>For Quebec residents only, to the extent permitted by law, these Terms will be governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec without respect to its conflicts of laws principles.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of the Services that are not subject to Section 13 (Disputes &amp.\nArbitration) of these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the courts of competent jurisdiction in the City of Montreal, and you and Instacart consent to the personal jurisdiction of those courts.</p> 16.\nEntire Agreement &amp.\nSeverability <p>These Terms, subject to any amendments, modifications, or additional agreements you enter into with Instacart, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Instacart with respect to the Services and any use of the Services.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid by a court competent jurisdiction, that provision only will be limited to the minimum extent necessary and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p> 17.\nNo Waiver <p>Instacart\u2019s failure to monitor or enforce a provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of its right to do so in the future with respect to that provision, any other provision, or these Terms as a whole.</p> 18.\nAssignment <p>You may not assign any of your rights, licenses, or obligations under these Terms.\nAny such attempt at assignment by you shall be void.\nInstacart may assign its rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without limitation.</p> 19.\nChanges to the Terms <p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time.\nWhen Instacart does so, Instacart will post the most current version of the Terms on
