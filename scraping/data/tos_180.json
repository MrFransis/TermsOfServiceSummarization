13.\nSteam is not intended for children under 13 and Valve will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>\n<p>A.\nContracting Party</p>\n<p>For any interaction with Steam your contractual relationship is with Valve.\nExcept as otherwise indicated at the time of the transaction (such as in the case of purchases from another Subscriber in a Subscription Marketplace), any transactions for Subscriptions (as defined below) you make on Steam are being made from Valve.</p>\n<p>B.\nSubscriptions.\nContent and Services</p>\n<p>As a Subscriber you may obtain access to certain services, software and content available to Subscribers.\nThe Steam client software and any other software, content, and updates you download or access via Steam, including but not limited to Valve or third-party video games and in-game content, software associated with Hardware and any virtual items you trade, sell or purchase in a Steam Subscription Marketplace are referred to in this Agreement as \"Content and Services;\" the rights to access and/or use any Content and Services accessible through Steam are referred to in this Agreement as \"Subscriptions.\"</p>\n<p>Each Subscription allows you to access particular Content and Services.\nSome Subscriptions may impose additional terms specific to that Subscription (\"Subscription Terms\") (for example, an end user license agreement specific to a particular game, or terms of use specific to a particular product or feature of Steam).\nAlso, additional terms (for example, payment and billing procedures) may be posted on http://www.steampowered.com or within the Steam service (\"Rules of Use\").\nRules of Use include the Steam Online Conduct Rules http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct and the

your login and/or password may have been compromised, you must notify Valve via the support form (https://support.steampowered.com/newticket.php) without any delay.</p>\n<p>Your Account, including any information pertaining to it (e.g.: contact information, billing information, Account history and Subscriptions, etc.), is strictly personal.\nYou may therefore not sell or charge others for the right to use your Account, or otherwise transfer your Account, nor may you sell, charge others for the right to use, or transfer any Subscriptions other than if and as expressly permitted by this Agreement

final, except as described in Sections 3.I and 7 below.</p>\n<p>A.\nPayment Authorization</p>\n<p>When you provide payment information to Valve or to one of its payment processors, you represent to Valve that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment, and you authorize Valve to charge your credit card or to process your payment with the chosen third-party payment processor for any Subscription, Steam Wallet funds, Hardware or other fees incurred by you.\nValve may require you to provide your address or other information in order to meet its obligations under applicable tax law.\n</p>\n<p>For Subscriptions purchased based on an agreed usage period, where recurring payments are made in exchange for continued use (\"Recurring Payment Subscriptions\"), by continuing to use the Recurring Payment Subscription you agree and reaffirm that Valve is authorized to charge your credit card (or your Steam Wallet, if funded), or to process your payment with any other applicable third-party payment processor, for any applicable recurring payment amounts.\nIf you have purchased any Recurring Payment Subscriptions, you agree to notify Valve promptly of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, or your PayPal or other payment account number, and you agree to notify Valve promptly if your credit card or PayPal or other payment account expires or is cancelled for any reason.</p>\n<p>If your use of Steam is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Valve may also charge you for those taxes, in addition to the Subscription or other fees published in the Rules of Use.\nThe European Union VAT (\"VAT\") tax amounts collected by Valve reflect VAT due on the value of any Content and Services, Hardware or Subscription.</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose.\nIf you do this, Valve may terminate your access to your Account.</p>\n<p>B.\nResponsibility for Charges Associated With Your Account</p>\n<p>As the Account holder, you are responsible for all charges incurred, including applicable taxes, and all purchases made by you or anyone that uses your Account, including your family or friends.\nIf you cancel your Account, Valve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred before cancellation.\nAny delinquent or unpaid Accounts must be settled before Valve will allow you to register again.</p>\n<p>C.\nSteam Wallet</p>\n<p>Steam may make available an account balance associated with your Account (the \"Steam Wallet\").\nThe Steam Wallet is neither a bank account nor any kind of payment instrument.\nIt functions as a prepaid balance to purchase Content and Services.\nYou may place funds in your Steam Wallet up to a maximum amount determined by Valve, by credit card, prepaid card, promotional code, or any other payment method accepted by Steam.\nWithin any twenty-four (24) hour period, the total amount stored in your Steam Wallet plus the total amount spent out of your Steam Wallet, in the aggregate, may not exceed US$2,000 or its equivalent in your applicable local currency -- attempted deposits into your Steam Wallet that exceed this threshold may not be credited to your Steam Wallet until your activity falls below this threshold.\nValve may change or impose different Steam Wallet balance and usage limits from time to time.</p>\n<p>You will be notified by e-mail of any change to the Steam Wallet balance and usage limits within sixty (60) days before the entry into force of the change.\nYour continued use of your Steam Account more than thirty (30) days after the entry into force of the changes will constitute your acceptance of the changes.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to the changes, your only remedy is to terminate your Steam Account or to cease use of your Steam Wallet.\nValve shall not have any obligation to refund any credits remaining on your Steam Wallet in this case.</p>\n<p>You may use Steam Wallet funds to purchase Subscriptions, including by making in-game purchases where Steam Wallet transactions are enabled, and Hardware.\nSubject to Section 3.I, funds added to the Steam Wallet are non-refundable and non-transferable.\nSteam Wallet funds do not constitute a personal property right, have no value outside Steam and can only be used to purchase Subscriptions and related content via Steam (including but not limited to games and other applications offered through the Steam Store, or in a Steam Subscription Marketplace) and Hardware.\nSteam Wallet funds have no cash value and are not exchangeable for cash.\nSteam Wallet funds that are deemed unclaimed property may be turned over to the applicable authority.</p>\n<p>D.\nTrading and Sales of Subscriptions Between Subscribers</p>\n<p>Steam may include one or more features or sites that allow Subscribers to trade, sell or purchase certain types of Subscriptions (for example, license rights to virtual items) with, to or from other Subscribers (\"Subscription Marketplaces\").\nAn example of a Subscription Marketplace is the Steam Community Market.\nBy using or participating in Subscription Marketplaces, you authorize Valve, on its own behalf or as an agent or licensee of any third-party creator or publisher of the applicable Subscriptions in your Account, to transfer those Subscriptions from your Account in order to give effect to any trade or sale you make.</p>\n<p>Valve may charge a fee for trades or sales in a Subscription Marketplace.\nAny fees will be disclosed to you prior to the completion of the trade or sale.</p>\n<p>If you complete a trade, sale or purchase in a Subscription Marketplace, you acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for taxes, if any, which may be due with respect to your transactions, including sales or use taxes, and for compliance with applicable tax laws.\nProceeds from sales you make in a Subscription Marketplace may be considered income to you for income tax purposes.\nYou should consult with a tax specialist to determine your tax liability in connection with your activities in any Subscription Marketplace.</p>\n<p>You understand and acknowledge that Valve may decide to cease operation of any Subscription Marketplace, change the fees that it charges or change the terms or features of the Steam Subscription Marketplace.\nValve shall have no liability to you because of any inability to trade Subscriptions in the Steam Trading Marketplace, including because of discontinuation or changes in the terms, features or eligibility requirements of any Subscription Marketplace.</p>\n<p>You also understand and acknowledge that Subscriptions traded, sold or purchased in any Subscription Marketplace are license rights, that you have no ownership interest in such Subscriptions, and that Valve does not recognize any transfers of Subscriptions (including transfers by operation of law) that are made outside of Steam.</p>\n<p>E.\nRetail Purchase</p>\n<p>Valve may offer or require a Subscription for purchasers of retail packaged product versions or OEM versions of Valve products.\nThe \"CD-Key\" or \"Product Key\" accompanying such versions is used to activate your Subscription.</p>\n<p>F.\nSteam Authorized Resellers</p>\n<p>You may purchase a Subscription through an authorized reseller of Valve.\nThe \"Product Key\" accompanying such purchase will be used to activate your Subscription.\nIf you purchase a Subscription from an authorized reseller of Valve, you agree to direct all questions regarding the Product Key to that reseller.</p>\n<p>G.\nFree Subscriptions</p>\n<p>In some cases, Valve may offer a free Subscription to certain services, software and content.\nAs with all Subscriptions, you are always responsible for any Internet service provider, telephone, and other connection fees that you may incur when using Steam, even when Valve offers a free Subscription.</p>\n<p>H.\nThird-Party Sites</p>\n<p>Steam may provide links to other third-party sites.\nSome of these sites may charge separate fees, which are not included in and are in addition to any Subscription or other fees that you may pay to Valve.\nSteam may also provide access to third-party vendors, who provide content, goods and/or services on Steam or the Internet.\nAny separate charges or obligations you incur in your dealings with these third parties are your responsibility.\nValve makes no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding any third party site.\nIn particular, Valve makes no representation or warranty that any service or subscription offered via third-party vendors will not change or be suspended or terminated.</p>\n<p>I.\nRefunds and Right of Withdrawal</p>\n<p>Without prejudice to any statutory rights you may have, you can request a refund for your purchases on Steam in accordance with the terms of Valve\u2019s Refund Policy http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/.</p>\n<p>For European Union consumers:</p>\n<p>EU law provides a statutory right to withdraw from certain contracts for physical merchandise and for the purchase of digital content.\nYou can find more information about the extent of your statutory right to withdraw and the ways you can exercise it on this page: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=8620-QYAL-4516.</p>\n<p>4.\nONLINE CONDUCT, CHEATING AND PROCESS TAMPERING<small> \u23f6</small>\n</p>\n<p>Your online conduct and interaction with other Subscribers should be guided by common sense and basic etiquette.\nThey must notably comply with the Steam Online Conduct Rules, to be found at http://steampowered.com/index.php?area=online_conduct.\nDepending on terms of use imposed by third parties who host particular games or other services, additional requirements may also be provided in the Subscription Terms applicable to a particular Subscription.</p>\n<p>Steam and the Content and Services may include functionality designed to identify software or hardware processes or functionality that may give a player an unfair competitive advantage when playing multiplayer versions of any Content and Services or modifications of Content and Services (\"Cheats\").\nYou agree that you will not create Cheats or assist third parties in any way to create or use Cheats.\nYou agree that you will not directly or indirectly disable, circumvent, or otherwise interfere with the operation of software designed to prevent or report the use of Cheats.</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not tamper with the execution of Steam or Content and Services unless otherwise authorized by Valve.\nYou acknowledge and agree that either Valve or any host of an online multiplayer game distributed through Steam (\"External Host\") may refuse to allow you to participate in certain online multiplayer games if you use Cheats or tamper with the execution of Steam or the Content and Services.</p>\n<p>Further, you acknowledge and agree that External Hosts may report your use of Cheats or unauthorized process tampering to Valve, and Valve may communicate your history of use thereof to External Hosts within the boundaries of the Steam Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Valve may terminate your Account or a particular Subscription for any conduct or activity that is illegal, constitutes a Cheat, or otherwise negatively affects the enjoyment of Steam by other Subscribers.\nYou acknowledge that Valve is not required to provide you notice before terminating your Subscription(s) and/or Account.</p>\n<p>You may not use Cheats, automation software (bots), mods, hacks, or any other unauthorized third-party software, to modify or automate any Subscription Marketplace process or the process of Steam account creation.</p>\n<p>5.\nTHIRD-PARTY CONTENT<small> \u23f6</small>\n</p>\n<p>In regard to all Subscriptions, Content and Services that are not authored by Valve, Valve does not screen such third-party content available on Steam or through other sources.\nValve assumes no responsibility or liability for such third party content.\nSome third-party application software is capable of being used by businesses for business purposes - however, you may only acquire such software via Steam for private personal use.</p>\n<p>6.\nUSER GENERATED CONTENT<small> \u23f6</small>\n</p>\n<p>A.\nGeneral Provisions </p>\n<p>Steam provides interfaces and tools for you to be able to generate content and make it available to other users and/or to Valve at your sole discretion.\n\"User Generated Content\" means any content you make available to other users through your use of multi-user features of Steam, or to Valve or its affiliates through your use of the Content and Services or otherwise.</p>\n<p>When you upload your content to Steam to make it available to other users and/or to Valve, you grant Valve and its affiliates the worldwide, non-exclusive right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, transcode, translate, broadcast, and otherwise communicate, and publicly display and publicly perform, your User Generated Content, and derivative works of your User Generated Content, for the purpose of the operation, distribution, incorporation as part of and promotion of the Steam service, Steam games or other Steam offerings, including Subscriptions.\nThis license is granted to Valve as the content is uploaded on Steam for the entire duration of the intellectual property rights.\nIt may be terminated if Valve is in breach of the license and has not cured such breach within fourteen (14) days from receiving notice from you sent to the attention of the Valve Legal Department at the applicable Valve address noted on this Privacy Policy page.\nThe termination of said license does not affect the rights of any sub-licensees pursuant to any sub-license granted by Valve prior to termination of the license.\nValve is the sole owner of the derivative works created by Valve from your User Generated Content, and is therefore entitled to grant licenses on these derivative works.\nIf you use Valve cloud storage, you grant us a license to store your information as part of that service.\nValve may place limits on the amount of storage you may use.</p>\n<p>If you provide Valve with any feedback or suggestions about Steam, the Content and Services, or any Valve products, Hardware or services, Valve is free to use the feedback or suggestions however it chooses, without any obligation to account to you.</p>\n<p>B.\nContent Uploaded to the Steam Workshop</p>\n<p>Some games or applications available on Steam (\"Workshop-Enabled Apps\") allow you to create User Generated Content based on or using the Workshop-Enabled App, and to submit that User Generated Content (a \u201cWorkshop Contribution\u201d) to one or more Steam Workshop web pages.\nWorkshop Contributions can be viewed by the Steam community, and for some categories of Workshop Contributions users may be able to interact with, download or purchase the Workshop Contribution.\nIn some cases, Workshop Contributions may be considered for incorporation by Valve or a third-party developer into a game or into a Subscription Marketplace.</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that Valve is not obligated to use, distribute, or continue to distribute copies of any Workshop Contribution and reserves the right, but not the obligation, to restrict or remove Workshop Contributions for any reason.</p>\n<p>Specific Workshop-Enabled Apps or Workshop web pages may contain special terms (\u201cApp-Specific Terms\u201d) that supplement or change the terms set out in this Section.\nIn particular, where Workshop Contributions are distributed for a fee, App-Specific Terms will address how revenue may be shared.\nUnless otherwise specified in App-Specific Terms (if any), the following general rules apply to Workshop Contributions.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Workshop Contributions are Subscriptions, and therefore you agree that any Subscriber receiving distribution of your Workshop Contribution will have the same rights to use your Workshop Contribution (and will be subject to the same restrictions) as are set out in this Agreement for any other Subscriptions.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the license described in Section 6.A., Valve will only have the right to modify or create derivative works from your Workshop Contribution in the following cases: (a) Valve may make modifications necessary to make your Contribution compatible with Steam and the Workshop functionality or user interface, and (b) Valve or the applicable developer may make modifications to Workshop Contributions that are accepted for in-Application distribution as it deems necessary or desirable to enhance gameplay.\n</li>\n<li>You may, in your sole discretion, choose to remove a Workshop Contribution from the applicable Workshop pages.\nIf you do so, Valve will no longer have the right to use, distribute, transmit, communicate, publicly display or publicly perform the Workshop Contribution, except that (a) Valve may continue to exercise these rights for any Workshop Contribution that is accepted for distribution in-game or distributed in a manner that allows it to be used in-game, and (b) your removal will not affect the rights of any Subscriber who has already obtained access to a copy of the Workshop Contribution.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Except where otherwise provided in App-Specific Terms, you agree that Valve\u2019s consideration of your Workshop Contribution is your full compensation, and you are not entitled to any other rights or compensation in connection with the rights granted to Valve and to other Subscribers.</p>\n<p>C.\nPromotions and Endorsements</p>\n<p>If you use Steam services (e.g.\nthe Steam Curators\u2019 Lists or the Steam Broadcasting service) to promote or endorse a product, service or event in return for any kind of consideration from a third party (including non-monetary rewards such as free games), you must clearly indicate the source of such consideration to your audience.</p>\n<p>D.\nRepresentations and Warranties</p>\n<p>You represent and warrant to us that you have sufficient rights in all User Generated Content to grant Valve and other affected parties the licenses described under A.\nand B.\nabove or in any license terms specific to the applicable Workshop-Enabled App or Workshop page.\nThis includes, without limitation, any kind of intellectual property rights or other proprietary or personal rights affected by or included in the User Generated Content.\nIn particular, with respect to Workshop Contributions, you represent and warrant that the Workshop Contribution was originally created by you (or, with respect to a Workshop Contribution to which others contributed besides you, by you and the other contributors, and in such case that you have the right to submit such Workshop

or, if you choose, you may request that Valve terminate your access to a Subscription.\nHowever, Subscriptions are not transferable, and even if your access to a Subscription for a particular game or application is terminated, the original activation key will not be able to be registered to any other account, even if the Subscription was obtained in a retail store.\nAccess to Subscriptions purchased as a part of a pack or bundle cannot be terminated individually, termination of access to one game within the bundle will result in termination of access to all games purchased in the pack.\nYour cancellation of an Account, or your cessation of use of any Subscription or request that access to a Subscription be terminated, will not entitle you to any refund, including of any Subscription fees.\nValve reserves the right to collect fees, surcharges or costs incurred prior to the cancellation of your Account or termination of your access to a particular Subscription.\nIn

\u23f6</small>\n</p>\n<p>For All Customers Outside the European Union:</p>\n<p>You and Valve agree that this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made and executed in the State of Washington, U.S.A., and Washington law, excluding conflict of laws principles and the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, governs all claims arising out of or relating to: (i) any aspect of the relationship between us.\n(ii) this Agreement.\nor (iii) your use of Steam, your Account or the Content and Services.\nexcept that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs arbitration as far as your country\u2019s laws permit.\nSubject to Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) below, you and Valve agree that any claim asserted in any legal proceeding shall be commenced and maintained exclusively in any state or federal court located in King County, Washington, having subject matter jurisdiction.\nYou and Valve hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.\nIn any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, your use of Steam, your account, or the Content and Services, the prevailing party will be entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses (except arbitration -- see Section 11.C.)</p>\n<p>For EU Customers:</p>\n<p>In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, the performance or the validity of the Subscriber Agreement, an amicable solution will be sought before any legal action.\nYou can file your complaint at http://help.steampowered.com.\nIn case of failure, you may, within one year of the failed request, have recourse to an Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure by filing an online complaint on the European Commission\u2019s Online Dispute Resolution website: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage.</p>\n<p>In the event that out-of-court dispute resolutions fail, the dispute may be brought before the competent courts.</p>\n<p>11.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION/BINDING ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER<small> \u23f6</small>\n</p>\n<p>This Section 11 shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nIN PARTICULAR, IF YOU LIVE IN THE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC (CANADA) OR THE EUROPEAN UNION, THIS SECTION 11 DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>Most user concerns can be resolved by use of our Steam support site at https://support.steampowered.com/.\nIf Valve is unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Valve, this Section explains how the parties have agreed to resolve it.</p>\n<p>A.\nMust Arbitrate All Claims Except IP, Unauthorized Use, Piracy, or Theft</p>\n<p>YOU AND VALVE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION.\nTHAT INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO: (i) ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US.\n(ii) THIS AGREEMENT.\nOR (iii) YOUR USE OF STEAM, YOUR ACCOUNT, HARDWARE OR THE CONTENT AND SERVICES.\nIT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND INCLUDES ALL CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF ANOTHER PARTY.</p>\n<p>However, this Section 11 does not apply to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or Valve may bring in any court with jurisdiction: (i) claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief.\nand (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy, or theft.</p>\n<p>This Section 11 does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.</p>\n<p>An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery.\nIt follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nThe arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</p>\n<p>B.\nTry to Resolve Dispute Informally First</p>\n<p>You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.\nIf you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration.\nWritten notice to Valve must be sent via postal mail to: ATTN: Arbitration Notice, Valve Corporation, P.O.\nBox 1688, Bellevue, WA 98004.\n</p>\n<p>C.\nArbitration Rules and Fees</p>\n<p>The U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act applies to this Section 11 as far as your country\u2019s laws permit.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (or the Commercial Arbitration Rules, if the Consumer Arbitration rules are inapplicable) of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") as modified by this Agreement.\nRules are available at http://www.adr.org.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>The AAA will administer the arbitration.\nOutside the U.S., Valve will select a neutral arbitration provider that uses these or similar rules.\nIt may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>If you seek $10,000 or less, Valve agrees to promptly reimburse your filing fee and your share if any of AAA\u2019s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment.\nValve agrees not to seek its attorneys\u2019 fees or costs unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment.\nIf you seek more than $10,000 and the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules do not apply, the AAA\u2019s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Valve according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.</p>\n<p>D.\nIndividual Binding Arbitration Only</p>\n<p>YOU AND VALVE AGREE NOT TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, WHISTLE BLOWER ACTION, OR CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, EVEN IF AAA\u2019s RULES WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW ONE.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.\nYou and Valve also agree not to seek to combine any action or arbitration with any other action or arbitration without the consent of all parties to this Agreement and all other actions or arbitrations.</p>\n<p>This Agreement does not permit class, collective, or representative arbitration.\nA court has exclusive authority to rule on any assertion that it does.</p>\n<p>E.\nWhat Happens if Part of Section 11 Is Found Illegal or Unenforceable</p>\n<p>If any part of Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class, collective, or representative arbitration, all of Section 11 will be unenforceable and the claim or dispute will be resolved in court.</p>\n<p>12.\nMISCELLANEOUS<small> \u23f6</small>\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, in the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be held by an arbitrator, court, or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\nSection 11.E.\ngoverns if some parts of Section 11 (Dispute Resolution/Binding Arbitration/Class Action Waiver) are held to be illegal or unenforceable.\nThis Agreement, including any Subscription Terms, Rules of Use, the Valve Privacy Policy, and the Valve Hardware Limited Warranty Policy, constitutes and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior oral or written agreements.\nYou agree that this Agreement is not intended to confer and does not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Valve\u2019s obligations are subject to existing laws and legal process and Valve may comply with law enforcement or regulatory requests or requirements notwithstanding any contrary term.</p>\n<p>You agree to comply with all applicable import/export laws and regulations.\nYou agree not to export the Content and Services or Hardware or allow use of your Account by individuals of any terrorist supporting countries to which encryption exports are at the time of exportation restricted by the U.S.\nBureau of Export Administration.\nYou represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country.</p>\n<p>This Agreement was last updated on August 28th, 2020 (\"Revision Date\").\nIf you were a Subscriber

bought a game by mistake.\nmaybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.</p>\n<p>It doesn't matter.\nValve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within the required return period, and, in the case of games, if the title has been played for less than two hours.\nThere are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we\u2019ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we\u2019ll take a look.</p>\n<p>You will be issued a full refund of your purchase within a week of approval.\nYou will receive the refund in Steam Wallet funds or through the same payment method you used to make the purchase.\nIf, for any reason, Steam is unable to issue a refund via your initial payment method, your Steam Wallet will be credited the full amount.\n(Some payment methods available through Steam in your country may not support refunding a purchase back to the original payment method.\nClick here for a full list.)</p> Where Refunds Apply <p>The Steam refund offer, within two weeks of purchase and with less than two hours of playtime, applies to games and software applications on the Steam store.\nHere is an overview of how refunds work with other types of purchases.</p> Refunds on Downloadable Content<br>(Steam store content usable within another game or software application, \"DLC\") <p>DLC purchased from the Steam store is refundable within fourteen days of purchase, and if the underlying title has been played for less than two hours since the DLC was purchased, so long as the DLC has not been consumed, modified or transferred.\nPlease note that in some cases, Steam will be unable to give refunds for some third party DLC (for example, if the DLC irreversibly levels up a game character).\nThese exceptions will be clearly marked as nonrefundable on the Store page prior to purchase.</p> Refunds on In-game Purchases <p>Steam will offer refund for in-game purchases within any Valve-developed games within forty-eight hours of purchase, so long as the in-game item has not been consumed, modified or transferred.\nThird-party developers will have the option to enable refunds for in-game items on these terms.\nSteam will tell you at the time of purchase if the game developer has opted to offer refunds on the in-game item you are buying.\nOtherwise, in-game purchases in non-Valve games are not refundable through Steam.</p> Refunds on Pre-Purchased Titles <p>When you pre-purchase a title on Steam (and have paid for the title in advance), you can request a refund at any time prior to release of that title.\nThe standard 14-day/two-hour refund period also applies, starting on the game\u2019s release date.</p> Steam Wallet Refunds <p>You may request a refund for Steam Wallet funds within fourteen days of purchase if they were purchased on Steam and if you have not used any of those funds.</p> Renewable Subscriptions <p>For some content and services, Steam offers periodic (e.g.\nmonthly, yearly) access that you pay for on a recurring basis.\nIf a renewable subscription has not been used during the current billing cycle, you may request a refund within 48 hours of the initial purchase or within 48 hours of any automatic renewal.\nContent is considered used if any games within the subscription have been played during the current billing cycle or if any benefits or discounts included with the subscription have been used, consumed, modified or transferred.</p>\n<p>Please note that you can cancel an active subscription at any time by going to your account details.\nOnce cancelled, your subscription will no longer automatically renew but you will retain access to the content and benefits of the subscription through the end of your current billing cycle.</p> Steam Hardware <p>Within the applicable time frame identified in the Hardware Refund Policy, you may request a refund for Steam hardware and accessories purchased via Steam for any reason.\nYou must ship the hardware back to us within fourteen (14) days after requesting the refund, following the instructions we provide you.\nPlease see the Hardware Refund Policy for detailed guidelines on the return and cancellation process for Steam hardware and accessories.</p> Refunds on Bundles <p>You can receive a full refund for any bundle purchased on the Steam Store, so long as none of the items in the bundle have been transferred, and if the combined usage time for all items in the bundle is less than two hours.\nIf a bundle includes an in-game item or DLC that is not refundable, Steam will tell you if the whole bundle is refundable during check-out.</p> Purchases Made Outside of Steam <p>Valve cannot provide refunds for purchases made outside of Steam (for example, CD keys or Steam wallet cards purchased from third parties).</p> VAC Bans <p>If you have been banned by VAC (the Valve Anti-Cheat system) on a game, you lose the right to refund that game.</p> Video Content <p>We are unable to offer refunds for video content on Steam (e.g.\nmovies, shorts, series, episodes, and tutorials), unless the video is in a bundle with other (non-video) refundable content.</p> Refunds on Gifts <p>Unredeemed gifts may be refunded within the standard 14-day/two-hour refund period.\nRedeemed gifts may be refunded under the same conditions if the gift recipient initiates the refund.\nFunds used to purchase the gift will be returned to the original purchaser.</p> EU Right of Withdrawal <p>For an explanation of how the EU right of withdrawal works for Steam customers, click here.</p> Abuse <p>Refunds are designed to remove the risk from purchasing titles on Steam\u2014not as a way to get free games.\nIf it appears to us that you are abusing refunds, we may stop offering them to you.\nWe do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately rebuying that title for the sale price.</p> How to Request a Refund <p>You can request a refund or get other assistance with your Steam purchases at help.steampowered.com.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Last updated 10 November, 2020</p> ",

certain rights in relation to their Personal Data.\nWhile other jurisdictions may provide fewer statutory rights, we make the tools designed to exercise such rights available to our customers worldwide.<br>\n<br> To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we are providing a dedicated section on the Steam support page (the \"Privacy Dashboard\").\nThis gives you access to your Personal Data, allows you to rectify and delete it where necessary and to object to its use where you feel necessary.\nTo access it, log into the Steam support page at http://help.steampowered.com and choose the menu items <i>My Account -&gt.\nData Related to Your Steam Account.</i> In most cases, you can access, manage, or delete Personal Data in the Privacy Dashboard, but you may also contact Valve with questions or requests via the contact processes described in sections 8 and 10 below.<br>\n<br> As a resident of the European Economic Area you have the following rights in relation to your Personal Data: <br>\n<br> 6.1 Right of Access.\n<br> You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e.\nthe right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained.\nYou can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the Privacy Dashboard.\nIf the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request.\n<br>\n<br> 6.2 Right to Rectification.\n<br> If we process your Personal Data, we shall endeavor to ensure by implementing suitable measures that your Personal Data is accurate and up-to-date for the purposes for which it was collected.\nIf your Personal Data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can change the information you provided via the Privacy Dashboard.<br>\n<br> 6.3.\nRight to Erasure.\n<br> You have the right to obtain deletion of Personal Data concerning you if the reason why we could collect it (see section 2.\nabove) does not exist anymore or if there is another legal ground for its deletion.\nFor individual items of Personal Data please edit them through the Privacy Dashboard or request the deletion via the Steam support page.\nYou can also request the deletion of your Steam user account via the Steam support page.<br>\n<br> As a result of deleting your Steam User Account, you will lose access to Steam services, including the Steam User Account, Subscriptions and game-related information linked to the Steam User Account and the possibility to access other services you are using the Steam User Account for.\n<br>\n<br> We allow you to restore your Steam User Account during a grace period of 30 (thirty) days from the moment you request deletion of your Steam User Account.\nThis functionality allows you not to lose your account by mistake, because of your loss of your account credentials or due to hacking.\nDuring the suspension period, we will be able to finalize financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Steam User Account deletion request.\nAfter the grace period, Personal Data associated with your account will be deleted subject to section 4.\nabove.\n<br>\n<br> In some cases, deletion of your Steam User Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated.\nNamely, if your account has a business relationship with Valve, such as due to your work for a game developer, you will only be able to delete your Steam User Account after you have transferred this role to another user or have dissolved the business relationship.\nIn some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.<br>\n<br> 6.4 Right to Object.\n<br> When our processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR / section 2.c) of this Privacy Policy, you have the right to object to this processing.\nIf you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing as described in Article 21 of the GDPR.\nin particular if the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.<br>\n<br> 6.5 Right to restriction of processing of your Personal Data<br> You have the right to obtain restriction of processing of your Personal Data under the conditions set out in article 18 of the GDPR.<br>\n<br> 6.6 Right to Personal Data portability<br> You have the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured, commonly

you, you have the right to establish guidelines for the preservation, the deletion and the transmission of Personal Data after your death in accordance with article 40-1 of the Act No 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Information, Technology, Data Files and Civil Liberties.<br>\n<br>\n<b>7.\nChildren</b>\n<br>\n<br> The minimum age to create a Steam User Account is 13.\nValve will not knowingly
