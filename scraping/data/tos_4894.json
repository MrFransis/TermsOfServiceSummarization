recorded with the Personal Data in question.\n</p>4.2.3 Children\u2019s Data<p> Children are unable to Consent to the Processing of Personal Data for information society services.\nConsent must be sought from the person who holds parental responsibility over the child.\nHowever, it should be noted that where Processing is lawful under other grounds, as mentioned above in section 4.4.2, Consent need not be obtained from the child or the holder of parental responsibility.\n</p>\n<p> Should iSchoolConnect foresee a business need for obtaining parental consent for information society services offered directly to a child, guidance and approval must be obtained from the Privacy Officer before any Processing of a child\u2019s Personal Data may commence.\n</p>4.2.4 Data Quality<p> iSchoolConnect will adopt all necessary measures to ensure that the Personal Data it collects and Processes is complete and accurate in the first instance, and is updated to reflect the current situation of the Data Subject.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The measures adopted by iSchoolConnect to ensure data quality include: Correcting Personal Data known to be incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, misleading or outdated, even if the Data Subject does not request rectification.\n</li>\n<li>Keeping Personal Data only for the period necessary to satisfy the permitted uses or applicable statutory retention period.</li>\n<li>The removal of Personal Data if in violation of any of the Data Protection principles or if the Personal Data is no longer required.</li>\n<li> Restriction, rather than deletion of Personal Data, insofar as: <ul>\n<li>A law prohibits erasure.</li>\n<li>Erasure would impair legitimate interests of the Data Subject.</li>\n<li>The Data Subject disputes that their Personal Data is correct and it cannot be clearly ascertained whether their information is correct or incorrect.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>4.2.5 Digital Marketing<p> As a rule, iSchoolConnect will not send promotional or direct marketing material to an iSchoolConnect Data Subject through digital channels such as mobile phones, email and the Internet, without first obtaining their Consent.\niSchoolConnect wishing to carry out a digital marketing campaign without obtaining prior Consent from the Data Subject must first have it approved by the Privacy Officer.\n</p>\n<p> Where Personal Data Processing is approved for digital marketing purposes, the Data Subject must be informed at the point of first Data Subject that they have the right to object, at any stage, to having their data Processed for such purposes.\nIf the Data Subject puts forward an objection, digital marketing related Processing of their Personal Data must cease immediately and their details should be kept on a suppression list with a record of their opt-out decision, rather than being completely deleted.\n</p>\n<p> It should be noted that where digital marketing is carried out in a \u2018business to business\u2019 context, there is no legal requirement to obtain an indication of Consent to carry out digital marketing to individuals provided that they are given the opportunity to opt-out.\n</p>4.2.6 Data Retention<p> To ensure fair Processing, Personal Data will not be retained by iSchoolConnect for longer than necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was originally collected, or for which it was further processed.\n</p>\n<p> The length of time for which iSchoolConnect needs to retain Personal Data will be determined and set out in the Backup and Data Retention policy.\nThis takes into account the legal and contractual requirements, both minimum and maximum, that influence the retention periods set forth in the schedule.\nAll Personal Data should be deleted or destroyed as soon as possible where it has been confirmed that there is no longer a need to retain it.\n</p>4.2.7 Data Protection<p> iSchoolConnect will adopt physical, technical, and organisational measures to ensure the security of Personal Data.\nThis includes the prevention of loss or damage, unauthorised alteration, access or Processing, and other risks to which it may be exposed by virtue of human action or the physical or natural environment.\n</p>\n<p> The minimum set of security measures to be adopted by iSchoolConnect should conform to the standards mentioned in the \u2018Information Security Management System\u2019.\nA summary of the Personal Data related security measures is provided below: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent unauthorised persons from gaining access to data processing systems in which Personal Data are processed.</li>\n<li>Prevent persons entitled to use a data processing system from accessing Personal Data beyond their needs and authorisations.</li>\n<li>Ensure that Personal Data in the course of electronic transmission during transport cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorisation.</li>\n<li> Ensure access to Personal Data is governed through appropriate logical and physical access controls.\nEnsure that Personal Data is protected against undesired destruction or loss.\n</li>\n<li>Ensure that Personal Data is not kept longer than necessary.</li>\n</ul>4.2.8 Data Subject Requests<p>The Privacy Officer will establish a system to enable and facilitate the exercise of Data Subject rights related to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information access.</li>\n<li>Restriction of Processing.</li>\n<li>Data rectification.</li>\n<li>Data erasure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If an individual makes a request relating to any of the rights listed above, iSchoolConnect will consider each such request in accordance with all applicable Data Protection laws and regulations.\nNo administration fee will be charged for

Data.</li>\n<li>Request restriction of Processing of their Personal Data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> All requests received for access to or rectification of Personal Data must be directed to the Privacy Officer, who will log each request as it is received.\nA response to each request will be provided within 30 days of the receipt of the written request from the Data Subject.\nAppropriate

arise where providing the information requested by a Data Subject would disclose Personal Data about another individual.\nIn such cases, information must be redacted or withheld as may be necessary or appropriate to protect that person\u2019s rights.\n</p>4.2.9 Law Enforcement Requests &amp.\nDisclosures<p> In certain circumstances, it is permitted that Personal Data be shared without the knowledge or Consent of a Data Subject.\nThis is the case where the disclosure of the Personal Data is necessary for any of the following purposes: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The prevention or detection of crime.</li>\n<li>The apprehension or prosecution of offenders.</li>\n<li>The assessment or collection of a tax or duty.</li>\n<li>By the order of a court or by any rule of law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If iSchoolConnect processes Personal Data for one of these purposes, then it may apply an exception to the Processing rules outlined in this policy but only to the extent that not doing so would be likely to prejudice the case in question.\n</p>4.2.10 Data Protection Training<p> All iSchoolConnect employees that have access to Personal Data will have their responsibilities under this policy

to allow access to the Personal Data from an overseas location.\nShould this occur, the iSchoolConnect entities sending the Personal Data remains responsible for ensuring protection for that Personal Data.\n</p>4.2.12 Transfers to Third Parties<p> iSchoolConnect will only transfer Personal Data to, or allow access by, third parties when it is assured that the information will be processed legitimately and protected appropriately by the recipient.\nWhere third party Processing takes place, iSchoolConnect will first identify if, under applicable law, the third party is considered a Data Controller or a Data Processor of the Personal Data being transferred.\n</p>\n<p> Where the third party is deemed to be a Data Controller, iSchoolConnect will enter into, in cooperation with the Privacy Officer, an appropriate agreement with the Controller to clarify each party\u2019s responsibilities in respect to the Personal Data transferred.\n</p>\n<p> Where the third party is deemed to
