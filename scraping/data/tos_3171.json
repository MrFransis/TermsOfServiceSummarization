Inc.\nand its group companies (\"Manscaped\",\n\"we\", \"us\" and \"our\") use cookies and similar technologies when you visit our website\nlocated at&nbsp;manscaped.com (collectively, the \u201cSite\u201d), or when you interact with\nManscaped online advertisements or marketing emails (collectively the \"Services\").\nIt\nexplains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control\nour use of them.\nIn some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect\npersonal information, or information that becomes personal information if we combine it with\nother information.</p>What are cookies?<p>Cookies are small files, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded onto your computer or mobile device when you visit certain websites.\nWhen you return to these websites, or visit other websites that use the same cookies, the websites recognize these cookies and your browsing device.\nA cookie cannot read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other websites.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website operator are called \"first party cookies\".\nCookies set by parties other than the website operator are called \"third party cookies\".\nThe parties that set third party cookies can recognize your web browser both when it visits the Manscaped website and when it visits certain other websites where the third party\u2019s cookies are also present.</p>\n<p>More information on cookies and their use can be found at aboutcookies.org or allaboutcookies.org.</p>Why do we use cookies?<p>When you access our Services, we or companies we work with may place cookies on your computer or other device.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, and inform us about which parts of our websites people have visited.</p>\n<p>We use first party and third party cookies to recognize you as a Manscaped customer, customize Manscaped Services, content, and advertising, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk, help prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety.</p>\n<p>We may place cookies from third-party service providers who may use information about your visits to other websites to target advertisements for products and services available from Manscaped.\nWe do not control the types of information collected and stored by these third-party cookies.\nYou should check the third-party's website for more information on how they use cookies.</p>\n<p>The following are some examples of information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our Services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our Services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP address.</li>\n<li>We may collect information such as your language, inferred zip code or area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and time zone so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our Services.</li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our websites and platforms, which is used to understand which parts of our Services are of most interest.\nThis data is aggregated, and thus is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Cookie Policy and our Global Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ul>WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE?<p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>Strictly Necessary Cookies<p>These cookies are necessary for the Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.\nThey are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.</p>\n<p>These also include cookies we may rely on for fraud prevention.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.</p>Performance/Analytics Cookies<p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our Sites.\nThey help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site.\nAll information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.\nIf you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>Functionality Cookies<p>These cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor our Services so we can provide relevant content to you.\nFor example, a functionality cookie can remember your preferences (e.g., country or language selection), or your username.</p>Targeting/Advertising Cookies<p>Manscaped uses third party service providers to display advertising on our Services and serve advertising on other third party sites that may be relevant to you or your interests.\nThese cookies are also used to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.\nThey remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers.\nThis means that after you have been to our Site, you may see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet.\nThe information collected through this process by the third party service providers does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these.\nSuch advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less advertising tailored to your inferred interests on our Sites and will not receive targeted Manscaped advertisements on third party websites.</p>HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE?<p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will only stay on your device until you close your browser.\nPersistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.</p>WHAT OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DOES MANSCAPED USE?<p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies, like web beacons to track users of our Sites and Services.\nWeb beacons, or \"clear gifs,\" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.\nThey are used to track the online movements of web users.</p>\n<p>In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive or device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nWe and our third-party service provider employ web beacons for the reasons stated above (under \"Cookies\"), but primarily to help us better manage content on our Services by informing us which content is effective.</p>\n<p>We may also use so-called \"Flash Cookies\" (also known as \"Local Shared Objects or \"LSOs\") to collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</p>HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND TARGETED ONLINE MOBILE ADVERTISING<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept cookies.\nYou can exercise your preferences in relation to cookies served on our Sites by taking the steps outlined below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies.</strong> You can enable or disable categories of cookies by visiting the Privacy Settings.\nThis includes both first party and third party cookies.\nYou can also use the browser with which you are viewing this website to enable, disable or delete cookies.\nTo do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the \"Help\", \"Tools\" or \"Edit\" settings), or review the instructions provided by the browsers listed here: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari Desktop, Safari Mobile, and Android browser.\nPlease note, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of the Sites and Services.\nAlso, if you disable cookies other parts of the Services may not work properly.\nYou can find more information about how to change your browser cookie settings at allaboutcookies.org.</p>\n<p>There are also additional tools available to manage third party cookies.\nMany advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), both of which maintain websites where individuals can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members.\nTo opt-out of website interest-based advertising provided by each organization\u2019s respective participating companies, visit the DAA\u2019s opt-out portal available at optout.aboutads.info/, the DAA of Canada\u2019s opt-out portal available at youradchoices.ca/en/tools, or visit the NAI\u2019s opt-out portal available at optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1.\nResidents of the European Union may opt-out of online behavioural advertising served by the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s participating member organizations by visiting youronlinechoices.eu/.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Advertising:</strong> You can opt out of having your mobile advertising identifiers used for certain types of advertising by accessing the appropriate settings in your mobile device and following the instructions.\nIf you opt-out, we will remove all data about you and will not collect any further data.\nThe random ID previously assigned to you will be removed.\nThus, if at a later stage, you decide to opt-in, we will be unable to continue and track you using the prior ID and you will for all practical purposes be a new user.\nFor iOS devices, to limit interest-based ad tracking, go to Settings &gt.\nPrivacy &gt.\nAdvertising &gt.\nTurn on \u201cLimit Ad Tracking.\u201d For Android devices, go to Settings &gt.\nGoogle services &gt.\nAds &gt.\nTurn on \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization.\" For iOS and Android, you can also reset the advertising identifier that is currently assigned to you.</p>\n<p>To opt-out of data collection for interest-based advertising across mobile applications by participating companies, download the DAA\u2019s AppChoices mobile application opt-out offering here: youradchoices.com/appchoices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit \"Do Not Track\" or \"DNT\" signals.\nSince uniform standards for \"DNT\" signals have not been adopted, our Sites do not currently process or respond to \"DNT\" signals.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the website storage settings panel, available here: macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.\nYou can also control Flash Cookies by going to the global storage settings panel and following the instructions.\nSetting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.</p>WILL THIS COOKIE POLICY BE UPDATED?<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.\nIf we do, you will be notified when you first visit our website after the change.\nYou can also revisit this page if you wish to keep yourself informed.</p>APPENDIX A: Cookie Table<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory

List A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website \u2013 when visited by a user \u2013 asks your browser to store on your device in order to remember information about you, such as

Agreement, or (e) your violation of any rights of a third party, including intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nGoverning Law.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, the Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the substantive laws of the state of California, U.S.A., without regard to its choice of law provisions, and not by the 1980 U.N.\nConvention on contracts for the international sale of goods.\nIf the arbitration clause below is inapplicable then you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal or state courts in San Diego County, California for purposes of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms, including the purchase of any products from the Site.\nAny cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Site, including the purchase of MANSCAPED products must be commenced within one year after the claim or cause of action arises.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nArbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A.\nInitial Dispute Resolution.\nWe are available at support@manscaped.com to address any concerns you may have regarding the Site or any purchases you make of our products.\nMost concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.\nYou and we agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>\n<p>B.\nAgreement to Binding Arbitration.\nIf we do not reach a solution within 30 days from the time we begin informal dispute resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration.\nAll claims arising out of or relating to the Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties\u2019 relationship with each other and/or your use of the Site shall be finally settled by binding individual arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class arbitration.\nEach party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense.\nThe parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of the Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Terms is void or voidable.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe interpretation and enforcement of the Terms shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures.\nIf you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S.\nDollars ($250.00), we will pay the additional cost.\nIf we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.\nWe will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration.\nYou will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by MANSCAPED if you do not prevail in arbitration.</p>\n<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>\n<p>C.\nClass Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.\nYou and MANSCAPED further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and MANSCAPED each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver in this paragraph is void or unenforceable or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision in this section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>D.\nException - Small Claims Court Claims.\nNotwithstanding the parties\u2019 agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>E.\n30 Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 15(B), 15(C), and 15(D) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email:

with the terms of those sections.\nIf you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>\n<p>NO CLASS ACTIONS </p>\n<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CONSOLIDATED OR CLASSWIDE BASIS.\nTHAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
