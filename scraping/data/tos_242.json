the below provisions of Section 25, (a) you and Daybreak agree that any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Daybreak Terms of Service or any aspect of the relationship between you and Daybreak (each, a \u201c<strong>Dispute</strong>\u201d) asserted by you against Daybreak or by Daybreak against you shall be exclusively brought in a state or federal court in the District of Delaware or Southern District of California, and (b) you and Daybreak each submit and consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts located in the District of Delaware or Southern District of California.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nDispute Resolution.\nArbitration.\nClass Action Waiver\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>25.1.\nIntroduction.</strong> Any Dispute, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, shall be settled through Negotiation (as defined below in this Section 25) or Arbitration (as defined below in this Section 25).\nprovided, however, with respect to Excluded Disputes (as defined below in this Section 25) that you and Daybreak are unable to settle through Negotiation, you or Daybreak may apply to the applicable court in the District of Delaware or Southern District of California to bring any such Excluded Disputes in lieu of Arbitration.</p>\n<p>If a Dispute arises, you and Daybreak first shall attempt in good faith to resolve it promptly by Negotiation as set forth below in this Section 25, and neither you nor Daybreak may commence Arbitration with respect to any Dispute unless you and Daybreak first have unsuccessfully pursued Negotiation as provided in this Section 25 (i.e., the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute in writing within the below thirty (30) day period or if either party refuses to comply with the provisions of any written Negotiation settlement).\nAll communications, whether oral, written or electronic, in any Negotiation or Arbitration (including, without limitation, any written Negotiation settlement or Arbitration award) pursuant to this Section 25 shall be treated as confidential, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the Arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application in accordance with the above provisions of Section 24, or except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law.\nNotwithstanding the above provisions set forth in Section 24, (i) the Federal Arbitration Act applies to and governs the enforceability of this Section 25, and (ii) all communications, whether oral, written or electronic, in Negotiations shall also be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>25.2.\nNegotiation.</strong> At any time after a Dispute arises, either you or Daybreak may initiate negotiation by providing written notice (the \u201c<strong>Dispute Notice</strong>\u201d) to the other party as follows (\u201c<strong>Negotiation</strong>\u201d): (a) you shall email Dispute Notices to Daybreak to disputenotice@daybreakgames.com and (b) Daybreak shall email Dispute Notices to you to the email address that Daybreak has on file for you.\nThe Dispute Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the Dispute and sets forth the relief sought.\nYou and a Daybreak representative shall speak by phone and/or communicate via email at a mutually acceptable time and thereafter as often as reasonable necessary, to attempt to resolve the Dispute.\nNo party shall be obligated to continue to participate in Negotiation if the parties have not resolved the Dispute in writing within thirty (30) days after the non-complaining party\u2019s receipt of the Dispute Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>25.3.\nArbitration.</strong> If you and Daybreak are unable to resolve any Dispute through Negotiation or if either you or Daybreak refuses to comply with the provisions of any written Negotiation settlement, then, except for any Excluded Disputes (as hereinafter defined), SUCH DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR (\u201c<strong>Arbitration</strong>\u201d) INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOU AND Daybreak AGREE THAT YOU AND Daybreak ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY.\nAs used in this Daybreak Terms of Service, \u201c<strong>Excluded Dispute</strong>\u201d collectively means: (a) any Dispute relating to the infringement, misappropriation and/or other misuse of intellectual property rights other than patent rights (including, without limitation, claims seeking injunctive relief).\n(b) any Dispute relating to the violation, misappropriation and/or other misuse of confidential information (including, without limitation, claims seeking injunctive relief).\n(c) any Dispute relating to the enforcement of an Arbitration award.\nand/or (d) any Dispute that qualifies for small claims court.</p>\n<p>An Arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery.\nIt follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nThe arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.</p>\n<p>The Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, as amended by this Daybreak Terms of Service.\nThe Consumer Arbitration Rules are available online at <strong>https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/rules/searchrules/rulesdetail?_afrWindowId=pay9lxinm_1&amp;_afrLoop=691540015434269&amp;doc=ADRSTAGE2021424&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=hf27f5iaa_4#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dpay9lxinm_1%26_afrLoop%3D691540015434269%26doc%3DADRSTAGE2021424%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dpay9lxinm_79</strong> .\nAdditionally, the arbitrator shall follow applicable state and federal law.</p>\n<p>If you seek $10,000 or less in any Arbitration initiated by you, Daybreak agrees to reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator.\nIf you seek more than $10,000 in any Arbitration initiated by you, the Arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Daybreak according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules and the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures.</p>\n<p>YOU AND DAYBREAK AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS DAYBREAK TERMS OF SERVICE WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU AND DAYBREAK ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or Daybreak that an in-person hearing is appropriate.\nAny in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination shall be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will follow the terms of this Daybreak Terms of Service and will be final and binding.\nThe arbitrator will have authority to award temporary, interim or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of this Daybreak Terms of Service, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator.\nThe award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in this Daybreak Terms of Service will preclude you or Daybreak from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you or against you for us, as applicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\nGeneral

about you from other sources, such as our affiliates, public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms, from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, and from other third parties.\nFor example, if you elect to connect your social media account to your Services account, certain Personal Information from your social media account may be

registration procedures and the security of your account is set out in the Daybreak Terms of Service.</p>\nC.\nE-mail Newsletters and Friend to Friend Promotions\n<p>Typically you need to have an
