features, those products or features may not be available or function correctly.</p>\n<p>We may also combine information users provide with data we collect automatically (as further described below).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Information We Collect Automatically</b>\n</p>\n<p>When you use our products, we collect some information automatically.\nFor example:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<b>Identifiers and device

(\u201cCCPA\u201d) requires us to disclose categories of personal information sold to third parties and how to opt-out of sale.\nThe CCPA defines personal information to include online identifiers, including IP address, cookies IDs, and mobile IDs.\nThe law also defines a \u201csale\u201d to include simply making data available to third parties.&nbsp.\nBecause we let advertising and analytics providers collect IP addresses, cookie IDs, mobile IDs through our sites and apps when you use our online services, but do not \u201csell\u201d any other types of personal information, we provide our \u201cDo Not Sell My Info\u201d disclosures in this section.\nOther information related to your rights under the CCPA is contained in the California Rights section of this statement.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Site Data</i>\n<br>We may collect information automatically about users when they visit our site.\nThis may include details about the user\u2019s browser type and installed extensions, operating system, access times, language, IP address, and referring URLs, along with other similar data.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Web Browser Cookies and Related Technologies</i>\n<br>Our site uses cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to provide features such as account logins and shopping carts, to remember user preferences, to engage in advertising and retargeting, as well as to analyze user behavior.\nCookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie.\nThe text in a cookie often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your device, but it can contain other information as well.\nWe use web beacons (also called single-pixel gifs), for example, to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage of our site and tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Third Party Sites and Services</i>\n</p>\n<p>Our site employs a variety of third-party services.\nThese include payment gateways, shipping providers, content-distribution networks, advertisers, analytics, and monitoring tools.\nSome of these services store information about users, and may track individuals across sites, applications, and services.\nThese services may collect information in a similar manner as described above, including, for example, IP address, access times, browser type, language, device type, and device identifiers.\nThey can also create inferences about you from this information.\nBy interacting with our services, certain information about user devices may be exposed to third party advertising and analytics using cookies and other tracking mechanism, these third parties include the entities in the charts below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The analytics

remove many cookies.\nPlease note also that choosing to reject or remove cookies may prevent certain features or services of our site from working properly.\nSince cookie opt-out preferences are also stored in a cookie in a browser, please also note that deleting cookies, using a different browser, or buying a new computer, may require renewal of opt-out choices.</p>\n<p>Do Not Track.\nDo Not Track&nbsp;(DNT) is a technology which allows users to tell sites they visit that they don\u2019t want to be tracked.\nIt does this by including a special header with each request the browser sends.\nWhere possible without breaking the functionality of our site, we try to honor Do Not Track headers by attempting to serve only third-party services which themselves promise to honor Do Not Track.\nHowever, because not all our necessary third-party service providers honor Do Not Track and because implementations may change from time to time, we cannot guarantee that we will always be successful in all cases.</p>\n<p>While we and others give users the choices described in this policy, there are many ways through which web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate user choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of nor honor every such mechanism.</p>\n<p>Mobile advertising ID controls.\niOS and Android operating systems provide options to limit tracking and/or reset the advertising IDs.</p>\n<p>Email web beacons.\nMost email clients have settings which allow you prevent the automatic downloading of images, which will disable web beacons in the email messages you read.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How We Use Collected Information</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use the personal data we collect for purposes described in this privacy statement or as otherwise disclosed to you,
