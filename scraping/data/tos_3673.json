the privacy of you and your students is very important to us.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell any personal information to advertisers or third parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We only share data with third parties when necessary to provide and improve the service - never for advertising or to monetize that data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As stated in our terms and conditions, Wakelet does use your personal information for certain stated purposes, such as providing and improving the service and communicating with Registered Users (but not anonymous users).\n</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy below describes what information we collect from you, how we use that information, and the legal basis we have to process your information.\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy governs how Wakelet Limited (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) a limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales with company number 07483296 and with its registered office and main trading address at Wakelet, Bright Building, Manchester Science Park, Pencroft Way, Manchester M15 6GZ, United Kingdom uses and shares personal information collected by our website at Wakelet.com, the Wakelet mobile app, and any associated services and content (the \u201cService\u201d).\nWe are the data controller in respect of any information we collect about you on or through Wakelet.</p>\n<p>This policy only applies to us and to our Agents and how we will use your personal information.\nPlease be aware that once personal information has been posted on Wakelet this will be visible to the public (unless you tell us that you do not want it to be publicly available) and we cannot control what other Wakelet users do with any information you share on or through Wakelet.\nBe careful with your own information and what you are willing to share.\n</p>\n<p>The Definitions at the end of this Policy set out the meaning of any capitalised words used in this Policy.\n</p> 1.\nWakelet is a Public Platform.\n<p>Wakelet is for both public and private use.\nWhenever you add Content through Wakelet that is not created as a private display it will be public, and when you provide us with User Content or make User Comments on a non-private collection it is published so that anyone can view it.</p>\n<p>Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that Content.\nIn addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through features native to Wakelet Services, such as commenting and embedding.\nIf you are a teacher or parent who is using Wakelet with or for children under the age of 13, then you should ensure that you have selected the privacy controls available to you.\nIf we become aware that children are posting content on Wakelet that is publicly accessible, then we can require verifiable parent or teacher consent as a condition to continue public access or, in the absence of such consent, convert the postings to private use.</p> 2.\nInformation Wakelet Collects and how it is used <p>Wakelet may collect personal information from Registered Users as described below.\n</p> 2.1 Registered User Account Information <p>When a Registered User creates an account on the Service, we ask you to provide your email address and password, or to authenticate yourself through a third-party service, like Facebook.\nWhen you authenticate through another site, that account is linked to your Wakelet account.\nOnce linked, we may collect and store personally identifying information that you have provided to that third-party service, and consented to having shared with services like us (please see section 4.2).\nInformation gathered includes your name, email address, avatar, and public data.</p>\n<p>We will store the email address and password that you provided to create your Wakelet Account and any information you or we add to your Wakelet account, including your name, handle, bio, profile image and any links you choose to add to your Wakelet account.\nWhere you use a third-party site to authenticate your Wakelet account, we do not receive or store passwords for your linked accounts.</p>\n<p>Occasionally, we might need to use your email address to send you important information about our Services.\nWe might need to send you some administrative information, tell you something important about your account or changes to our Services, or update you on new policies or terms.\nThese administrative communications are considered part of our Services and your Wakelet account.</p> 2.2 Third Party Site Information <p>When you link your Wakelet account to a third-party service account, we may receive your biographical information (birthday, education and similar information particular to you) or your geographic location from that third-party service (if you have provided that information to the service and made it available for Wakelet to access).</p>\n<p>We may store and use this information to improve and personalise Wakelet and make suggestions to you about Content and Users that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>You should take care when linking with a third-party service account that you have checked (using that service\u2019s settings) that you are comfortable with the information that they will share with us.\nAs a general practice, we strongly urge you to make careful judgements about any personal information you disclose to Internet services, including Wakelet and any third-party services you link to us.\n</p> 2.3 Communications with Us <p>If you contact us, or we contact you, with any query or comment about Wakelet or your use of Wakelet, we may keep a record of that correspondence.\n</p> 2.4 Surveys and Market Research <p>We may ask you to complete surveys in connection with your Wakelet Account where we may receive your name, email address, account use information and opinions.\nWe use this personal information for research purposes.\nWe anonymise the data and answered questions so that it is no longer personal information and use this for our own purposes.</p> 2.5 Technical Information <p>We may also keep details of your visits to Wakelet including, but not limited to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Traffic data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Location data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Web logs and other communication data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The resources that you access when you use Wakelet </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with Wakelet.\nThis information may include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Browser type and version</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Operating system and version

make</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Screen display information </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may collect information about your device, including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration.\n</p>\n<p>We use this information to fight spam, malware and identity theft.\nWe may also use it to create a profile of your use of Wakelet, to personalise Wakelet for you, and to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how people use Wakelet.</p>\n<p>We also collect your IP address when you navigate to a third-party website, which has established a Wakelet frame on its website.\nWe use your IP address only for the purpose of displaying the relevant collection to you.\n</p> 2.6 Information relating to User Content <p>In some cases, we may collect information by analysing your User Content.\nWe may do this where you upload a link to Wakelet, by analysing the content of any such link and determining its broad subject matter (for example, sports, music, technology, science etc.) This allows us to improve our Services by enhancing your ability to organise content, search topics of interest, and generally provide additional features and functionality.\n</p> 2.7 Information Relating to Your Use of Wakelet <p>We collect information about how you use Wakelet, whether you are a Registered User or User.\nThis includes general usage information such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The number and frequency of visits</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The pages or features of Wakelet people have visited</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The links on Wakelet they have clicked on </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The length of visits </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Users you have followed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The collections you have liked </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The comments you make </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Users you interact with </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of this information may be associated with the IP address used to access Wakelet and some may be associated with your Wakelet account, such as the topics you search for and the help pages that you visit.\n</p>\n<p>We will use this information to help improve the Service.\nWe will also use this information to identify Content that you are likely to be interested in or to suggest Content and Users that we think may be of interest to you (both on Wakelet and by email).\n</p> 2.8 Location Information <p>In some cases, we collect and store information about where you are located by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation.\nWe may use location information to improve and personalise the Service for you by finding and presenting Content to you that we think will be of interest to you based on your location, for example news stories or topics of interest similar to those you post.\n</p> 2.9 Information Collected through Email Tracking <p>To measure the deliverability and interest of our emails for Registered Users, we may embed information, such as a web beacon or tag, in them.\nThis allows us to see which of our emails you have read and clicked-through from so that we can analyse the effectiveness of our communications and seek to make them more relevant for you in the future.</p> 2.10 Cookies and Similar Technologies <p>Wakelet uses cookies (small text files placed on your device\u2019s hard disk) and similar technologies to provide the Service, to better understand how you interact with Wakelet, to monitor aggregate usage by our Users and Registered Users and web traffic routing on Wakelet, and to customise and improve Wakelet.\nOur cookies, both session cookies and persistent cookies, do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you.\n</p>\n<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.\nYou can instruct your browser \u2013 by changing its settings \u2013 to stop accepting cookies, or to prompt you before accepting cookies from the websites you visit.\nHowever, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts of Wakelet.\nUnless you have adjusted your browser settings so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as soon as you visit Wakelet.\n</p> 3.\nInformation We Share <p>Wakelet does <strong>not</strong> sell User personal information.\n</p>\n<p>We never share information we receive from you unless: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We have your permission to share that information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That information is aggregate information or other information that does not identify you</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 3.1 Third-Party Services <p>This Privacy Policy only covers information we collect, it does not cover information collected by other services.\nIf you access or otherwise share information with third-party services through Wakelet Services, you are responsible for reading and understanding those other services\u2019 privacy policies (and we recommend you do this before sharing the information).\n</p>\n<p>You can access third-party services through Wakelet, for example, Users can embed externally-pointing links in their content and Users can click on those links to reach other sites and services.\nWe also allow Users to share information that you provide to us or embed a collection into a third-party site, like posts and comments, with other services, for example, Users may share posts on Twitter and Facebook.\n</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, we might share your stored information, such as IP addresses, with our third-party

servers.\nWhere we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access certain parts of Wakelet, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and not sharing it with anyone.\nIt\u2019s important for you to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by choosing and protecting a strong third-party service password and by limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished using Wakelet.\nWe will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information.\nif you receive such an email, send it to us so that we can investigate and take any appropriate action.\n</p>\n<p>We have put appropriate security measures in place to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.\nIn addition, we limit access to your personal data to only those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.\nThey will only process your personal information under our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>While we use reasonable efforts to protect your

processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>Where we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is given to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will only transfer your personal information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal information by the European Commission </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission that give personal information the same protection it has in Europe </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer information to them if they have agreed to the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 6.\nData Retention <p>We store the information we collect only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.\n</p>\n<p>We store the information we collect from Registered Users for as long as you have an Account and for 14 days thereafter.\nAfter this time, it will be purged from our data store and caches.\nLogs may contain some user information and are retained for up to 30 days.\nThe incremental back-up system of the AWS Dynamo data store can roll back tables over a time period of up to 35 days.\nTherefore, data is completely erased after 49 days.\nAnonymous aggregated analytic data is held in Google Analytics indefinitely.\n</p>\n<p>We store the information we collect from Users (without a Wakelet account) for 30 days, until logs are cleared.\nAnonymous aggregated analytic data is held in Google Analytics indefinitely.\n</p>\n<p>We periodically cleanse all information stored and will delete your IP address 30 days after collection.\n</p> 7.\nGDPR <p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you have the right to access, rectify, port and erase your data.\n</p>\n<p>You also have the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Request access to your personal information and receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you to check we are processing this lawfully</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request that the personal information we hold about you is corrected or updated </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request that personal information we hold about you is erased.\nYou can exercise this right where we have no good reason for continuing to process your personal data (subject to any legal reasons for needing to continue holding the personal data).\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Object to our processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest or are processing for direct marketing purposes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Restrict our processing of your personal data</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or a third party in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).\nWe would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us before escalating your complaint.\n</p> 8.\nMarketing <p>We will only send you marketing emails about collections, Users and Content we think may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>Wakelet does not send you marketing communications about third-party products or services.\nUsers may display any content, including advertising, so long as it does not conflict with our Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>You can ask us to stop sending you these emails at any time by using the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link in each email.</p>\n<p> If you do unsubscribe, we will still use your information to present Content on Wakelet, which we think will be of interest to you, but will not send you messages about these.</p> 9.\nInformation Choices and Changes <p>Registered Users may access or modify the personal information you have provided to us and that is associated with your account at any time.\nYou can log in to Wakelet and visit your account settings page or email us at admin@wakelet.com to exercise your rights at any time.\n</p>\n<p>We cannot delete your personal information without deleting your user account.\nWe may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.\n</p>\n<p>If you delete your User Content from Wakelet or request we do so, please note that User Content might have been copied or stored by other users.\n</p>\n<p>If you want to delete your user account, you can do this in your account settings page.\nGiven the sharing, commenting, and dialogue that takes place on Wakelet, some of the public activity on your account prior to deletion may have been copied to third-party servers outside of our control and so may remain accessible to the public indefinitely.\n</p> 10.\nCOPPA and Students <p>You must be over the age of 13 to be a Registered User of Wakelet.\n</p>\n<p>Children under 13 years of age may only use Wakelet under the supervision of a responsible adult (over the age of 18) who has agreed to our Terms and the provisions in respect of their responsibilities as a \u2018Group Registered User\u2019.\nWe do not send any marketing messages or advertising targeting children under the age of 13.\nIn order to create an account in Wakelet we require every user to verify that they are not under 13 years of age, and we do not permit children under the age of 13 to create an account.</p>\n<p>Teachers can invite students under the age of 13 to contribute to their collections through our \u2018Collaboration\u2019 feature.\nThese students can identify themselves by their first or given name or a nickname only visible to their teacher and other contributors to the collection.\nThe use of a surname or family name is not required for registration.\nWe do not require contributors using \u2018Collaboration\u2019 to provide their name, address or other contact information.\nWe hold no personal information on these Users other than what is necessary to provide the service.\nIf we have verifiable parental consent a family name will be permitted.</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.\nIf you are a student under the age of 13 you may use the interactive or public comment features of Wakelet, or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address or username only if we have verifiable parental or teacher consent.\nWe do not monitor or review content created by any user and we do not control the actions of third parties with whom a child may share information.\nA parent or teacher may request us to delete a child\u2019s PII of which he or she becomes aware.\n</p>\n<p>We expect that use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.\nFurther, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in our Rules, Terms and this Privacy Policy.\nWe encourage parents to educate their children about safety online and to carefully monitor their children's use of social features to ensure they do not disclose their personal information through them.\n</p>\n<p>In the United States, if you are a Group Registered User, including a School that is using Wakelet, that includes children under the age of 13, you (or your school) assumes the responsibility for complying with the United States Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d).\nThis means that the Group Registered User must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before using the Service with students.\nSchools may, under appropriate circumstances, provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians.\nFor more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy.coppafaqs.shtm</p>\n<p>If you are outside of the United States, please ensure that you are complying with any laws applicable to you before using Wakelet with students.\n</p>\n<p>If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at privacy@wakelet.com If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child\u2019s account.\nTo protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any information or make corrections.</p> Spaces <p>Spaces is an additional built-in feature of Wakelet which provides a streamlined way to organize a collection, Learning Project, Research Project or create any Spaces for the purpose of formulating rich content in an online environment.</p>\n<p>A teacher may create Spaces for a Classroom and would invite Students to participate in the Wakelet Spaces feature.\nStudents would be able to create their own collections for the classroom with the supervision of the Teacher.</p>\n<p>Students may be invited to join as a member of a Spaces Classroom by the teacher in one of the two methods described below:</p>\n<p> 1) The Teacher can provide a link to join by sharing this with the Student through a Student/Parent email

Wakelet as a Registered User on behalf of multiple potential users (whether adults or children), you will be referred to in these Terms as a \u201cRegistered Group User\u201d or collectively

so please check the Terms periodically for updates.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Privacy <p>Your privacy is very important to us.\nAny information that you provide to Wakelet and which we collect about you is subject to our Privacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information.\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge through your use of Wakelet that you have read and understood the terms of our Privacy Policy and agree with how we will use your information to provide Wakelet to you.\n</p> Changes to Service <p>We have the right to withdraw or revise Wakelet, and any service or material we provide on Wakelet, in our sole discretion and without notice, this will usually be to reflect our Registered Users\u2019 and Users\u2019 needs, our business priorities and developments of Wakelet.\n</p>\n<p>We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of Wakelet is unavailable at any time or for any period.\nAt any time we may restrict access to some parts of the site, or the entire site, to Users and Registered Users.</p> Accessing Wakelet And Account Security <p>You are responsible for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to Wakelet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensuring that all persons who access Wakelet through your Internet connection are aware of these Terms and comply with them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By using Wakelet, whether as a Registered User or as a User, you represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit as part of the Wakelet registration process is truthful and accurate.\n(b) you will maintain the accuracy of this information.\n(c) unless you are part of a Sponsored Group, you are thirteen (13) years of age or older if a User or Registered Individual and you are eighteen (18) years of age or older if you are a Group Registered user.\nand (d) your use of Wakelet does not violate any applicable law or regulation.\nYour Wakelet account may be deleted without notification if we have reason to believe that you do not meet these eligibility requirements.</p>\n<p>When you sign up to become a Registered User of Wakelet, you will be asked to choose a username and a password for your account, or Wakelet may assign a password to you that you may change.\nAlternatively we may allow you to use a third-party account and authorisation service (for example, Facebook and Google) in order to use Wakelet, and by using a third-party authorization service you are agreeing to that third party\u2019s terms of use, privacy policy and any other agreement between you and them.</p>\n<p>You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, you must treat such information as confidential, and you should not disclose it to any other person or entity.\n</p>\n<p>Unless you are a Group Registered User and have agreed to and comply with these Terms in full, you also acknowledge that your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other person with access to Wakelet or portions of it using your user name, password or other security information.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where you are a Group Registered User you should not share your username or password with any other person but we may permit you to allow other individuals access to Wakelet using your account, strictly in accordance with these Terms.\nWe encourage you to use \"strong\" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account.\nWakelet cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above.</p>\n<p>You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other breach of security.\nYou also agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.\nSubject to the foregoing, you should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.</p>\n<p>We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have violated any provision of these Terms.\nIf we do disable your account, you shall not create another account without our permission.</p> Can children use Wakelet? <p>Of course, but Wakelet is not currently directed to children and we expect that use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.\nFurther, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.\nIn the United States, if you are the sponsor of a Sponsored Group (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), including a School that is using Wakelet, that includes children under the age of 13, you (or your school) assumes the responsibility for complying with the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d).\nThis means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Service the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Service.\nSchools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians.\nFor more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.\nIf you are outside of the United States, please ensure that you are complying with any laws applicable to you before submitting any child\u2019s personal information or permitting any child to submit personal information to us.\nIf a school outside the United States wants to enable its students to use Wakelet, Wakelet will work with such schools on case by case basis to ensure compliance with any applicable laws regarding the collection of information from minors.</p> Wakelet Ownership and Licensing of Intellectual
