RESOLUTION</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND DISCOVERY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.&nbsp.\n</strong>This Section is deemed to be a \u201cwritten agreement to arbitrate\u201d pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.\nYou and Discovery agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the \u201cwriting\u201d requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.\nThis Section can only be amended by mutual agreement.</p>\n<p>We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us.\nTherefore, pursuant to this Visitor Agreement, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Discovery Sites, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with Discovery, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to Discovery or that Discovery may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, \u201cDiscovery Transactions or Relationships\u201d), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration.\nBy using or interacting with the Discovery Sites, or engaging in any other Discovery Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.</p>\n<p>We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us.\nIf those efforts fail, by using the Discovery Sites, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against Discovery, and any claim that Discovery may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Visitor Agreement, our Privacy Notice, or any Discovery Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) administered by JAMS or its successor (\u201cJAMS\u201d) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d).\nThe Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com.\nIf JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the \u201cAAA\u201d) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the \u201cApplicable Rules\u201d in such circumstances).\nIf JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, Discovery agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below.\nFurthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>You further agree that:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Visitor Agreement and/or these arbitration provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Visitor Agreement is void or voidable;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Location of Arbitration</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business).\nor (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and Discovery.\nor (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Governing Law</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of New York consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles.\n(ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with New York or federal rules of procedure, as applicable.\n(iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law.\nand (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>No Class Relief</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or Discovery\u2019s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Written Award</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator\u2019s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an \u201cAward\u201d).\nJudgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Arbitration Costs</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Discovery will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Reasonable Attorney\u2019s Fees</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> In the event you recover an Award greater than Discovery\u2019s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award Discovery\u2019s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys\u2019 fees associated with the Arbitration, but Discovery shall in all events bear its own attorneys\u2019 fees;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> With the exception of \u201cNo Class Relief\u201d above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, \u201cNo Class Relief\u201d is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Discovery shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Modification of Arbitration Clause With Notice</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.</strong> Discovery may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty (30) days after Discovery has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from Discovery Transactions and Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.\nand</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Small Claims Matters are Excluded.\nNo Class Relief or Joinder of Claims</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.\n</strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against Discovery in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court\u2019s jurisdictional limit.\nprovided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CHOICE OF LAW<br>\n</strong>This Agreement has been made in and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.</p>\n<p>The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nNotwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CHOICE OF FORUM<br>\n</strong>By using the Discovery Sites, you agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any dispute not subject to the arbitration provision discussed above shall be the state and federal courts located in Maryland.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INDEMNITY<br>\n</strong>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Discovery Communications, LLC, its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors and suppliers, from and against any and all losses, expenses, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) resulting from any violation of this Visitor Agreement or any activity related to your account (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing any Discovery Site using your account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SEVERABILITY<br>\n</strong>In the event that any portion of this Visitor Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other portion of this Visitor Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect and be construed as if the
