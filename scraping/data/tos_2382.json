convey what Telehealth communication is, Patient rights, and obligations for each party.\nDoxy.me provides a template form or, depending on Your Account type, You may upload Your own form.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After the Patient signs the form, it should be downloaded by both You and Your Patient as it is not stored by the Service and will be permanently deleted.</p>\n<b>Session Privacy</b>\n<p>At any time during the Session, You may disable the audio, video, or both.\nDoing so may prevent effective communication with the Patient.\nHowever, there may be times when You wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons.</p>\n<p>You may terminate the Session at any time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<b>If You are a Patient</b>\n<p>This section only applies if You have received a unique web link (such as https://yourclinic.doxy.me/DrSmith) by a Provider and wish to communicate with the Provider by video conference using the Service.\nSome features are not activated automatically and require explicit authorization by You.</p>\n<b>Types of Data Processed</b>\n<b>Name to Enter Waiting Room&nbsp;</b>\n<p>A Patient does not need an account or register with doxy.me in order to use the Service.</p>\n<p>A Provider will email or text You a Provider Website link in order to enter the Waiting room.\nWhen You click on that link, it will take You to the welcome screen and You will be asked to enter Your name and click a \u201cCheck In\u201d button.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your name is only seen by the Provider and used for an initial identification.\nThere is no verification of the entry, nor is there a requirement that You use Your full name.\nYour name is used only for the current session and is not stored or otherwise used by the Service.</p>\n<b>Session Privacy</b>\n<p>At any time during the Session, You may disable the audio, video, or both.\nDoing so may prevent effective communication with the Provider.\nHowever, there may be times when You wish to disable the audio or video for personal reasons.</p>\n<p>You may also terminate the Session at any time.</p>\n<b>Protected Health Information (PHI)</b>\n<p>Although the Doxy.me Service is targeted to the healthcare community, no PHI is collected during the Session between Patient and Provider.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Any health or other sensitive information You discuss or send the Provider is sent over a secure channel using the SSL Internet protocol.</p>\n<b>File Transfer</b>\n<p>If You choose to send a file to the Provider, that file will be sent securely and then destroyed after 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>\n<b>Photo Capture</b>\n<p>If Your Provider chooses to capture a photo of You, that image will be sent securely and then destroyed after 15 minutes.</p>\n<b>Chats</b>\n<p>Any chats between You and the Provider are temporarily stored in computer memory, not on doxy.me services.\nOnce the browser is closed, the chat history is permanently deleted.</p>\n<b>Payment Information</b>\n<p>If You choose to pay the Provider during the Session, a credit card authorization screen will pop-up asking You to provide Your name and credit card details.\nAll credit card transactions are handled by Stripe, a third-party.\nDoxy.me does not capture or utilize any information You enter in the payment pop-up screen.\nFor more information, please visit https://stripe.com/</p>\n<b>Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form</b>\n<p>Your Provider may ask You to sign a Teleconsent Appointment Consent Form.\nThe purpose of the form is to inform You of what Telehealth communication is, and Your rights and obligations.\nYou should read the form completely and not hesitate to ask Your Provider for any clarifications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If You are required to sign the form, Your signature will be electronically captured by using Your mouse and be embedded in the form.\nThe form may be downloaded by both You and Your Provider and is not stored by the Service.</p>\n<b>Screenshare</b>\n<p>The Service provides a feature whereby You may share all or part of Your computer screen with the Provider.\nYou will be sent a message to confirm that You wish to share Your screen or a specific window.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are obvious privacy issues associated with sharing one\u2019s screen.\nIt is up to You to ensure that no sensitive or confidential information (other than that which You wish to show the Provider) be viewable during the screensharing session.</p>\n<p>For instance, if You do not wish the Provider to see Your email system or other open windows, it would be best to terminate those applications prior to the screenshare.</p>\n<b>If You are browsing this website as a guest</b>\n<p>When perusing this doxy.me website as a

business purpose</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose the personal information We collect about You to a third party for business purposes.\nIn this case, We enter a written agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the agreement.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose Your personal information to third parties when You explicitly ask or authorize us to do so, in order to provide You with our Service.</p>\n<p>To find out more about the purposes of processing, please refer to the relevant section of this document.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sale of Your personal information</b>\n</p>\n<p>For our purposes, the word \u201csale\u201d means any \u201cselling,

business to&nbsp;<b>another business or a third party, for monetary or other valuable consideration</b>\u201d.</p>\n<p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</b>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of Your personal information.\nThis means that whenever You request us to stop selling Your data, We will abide by Your request.</p>\n<p>Such requests can be made freely, at any time, without submitting any verifiable request, simply by following the instructions below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Instructions to opt out of the sale of personal information</b>\n</p>\n<p>If You\u2019d like to know more or exercise Your right to opt out in regard to all the sales carried out by doxy.me, both online and offline, You can contact us for further information using the contact details provided in this document.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What are the purposes for which We use Your personal information?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may use Your personal

proportionate to the business purpose for which it was collected, and strictly within the limits of compatible operational purposes.</p>\n<p>We may also use Your personal information for other reasons such as for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section \u201cDetailed information on the processing of Personal Data\u201d within this document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or We suffer an actual damage.</p>\n<p>We will not use Your personal information for different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without notifying You.</p>\n<b>Your California privacy rights and how to exercise them</b>\n<p>\n<b>The right to know and to portability</b>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that We disclose to You:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the categories and sources of the personal information that We collect about You, the purposes for which We use Your information and with whom such information is shared;</li>\n<li>in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where We disclose:\n<ul>\n<li>for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient.\nand</li>\n<li>for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>If We deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be \u201cportable\u201d, i.e.\ndelivered in an easily usable format to enable You to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance \u2013 provided that this is technically feasible.</p>\n<p>\n<b>The right to request the deletion of Your personal information</b>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that We delete any of Your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on doxy.me, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>\n<p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising Your right, We will delete Your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How to exercise Your rights</b>\n</p>\n<p>To exercise the rights described above, You need to submit Your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>\n<p>For us to respond to Your request, it\u2019s necessary that We know who You are.\nTherefore, You can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>\n<li>describe Your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not respond to any request if We are unable to verify Your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to You.</p>\n<p>If You cannot personally submit a verifiable request, You can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on Your behalf.</p>\n<p>If You are an adult, You can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under Your parental authority.</p>\n<p>You can submit a maximum number of two (2) requests over a period of 12 months.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How and when We are expected to handle Your request</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will

We need more time, We will explain to You the reasons why, and how much more time We need.\nIn this regard, please note that We may take up to 90 days to fulfill Your request.</p>\n<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12-month period.</p>\n<p>Should We deny Your request, We will explain You the reasons behind our denial.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to Your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nIn such cases, We may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request.\nIn either case, We will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p>\n<b>Third-Parties used by Doxy.me</b>\n<p>Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us.\nIf You click on a third-party
