to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers, or distributors.&nbsp;<b>REFUND POLICY</b>Unless otherwise stated in this Terms of Service, all fees for domain name registrations and related domain name Service(s) are refundable, for a full refund of the purchase price, within 14 days of purchase, with the exception of those domain name registrations and related domain name Service(s) purchased with crypto, which must have a refund request within 5 days of purchase.\nAll refunds will be processed with the same payment method used to purchase the domain, at the then-current spot rates for the USD value of your purchase at the time the refund is issued.&nbsp;<strong>Only the purchase price of your domain will be refunded.\nany claim fees, blockchain fees or other related fees paid by you will not be refunded.</strong>&nbsp;Unstoppable Domains strongly advises against purchasing any domain that is associated with a trademark, public figure, or with a known brand.\nHowever, in the event that you purchase a domain associated with a trademark, public figure, or a known brand, and wish to return such domain, Unstoppable Domains will refund the full purchase price of the domain regardless of the timing of the refund.&nbsp;Unstoppable Domains reserves the right to refuse, at its sole discretion, to sell a domain name to you for any reason (or to complete such sale once initiated).&nbsp;Domain fees from new domain name registrations may be refundable, at the sole discretion of Unstoppable Domains, in the event of issues arising from actual or prospective trademark infringement or other abuses, \u201cphishing\u201d (the fraudulent practice of sending emails purporting to be from reputable companies or individuals in order to induce individuals to reveal personal information), technical limitations on name resolutions, mispriced sales (i.e., where the price should have been higher), and legal exigencies (i.e., court-ordered blocking or takeover of domain names, law enforcement-related reasons, etc.).&nbsp;All refunds shall be made to your profile on our website in the original payment method used, or in store credit.&nbsp;All payments made by card and Paypal will be refunded and processed in US dollars: you are solely responsible for any fluctuations in the exchange rate between other national currencies or cryptocurrencies between the time period of the original payment and the time that the subsequent refund is issued.&nbsp;All payments made with cryptocurrency will be refunded and processed in the equivalent amount of USD that was received: you are solely responsible for any fluctuations in the exchange rate between other national currencies or cryptocurrencies between the time period of the original payment and the time that the subsequent refund is issued.&nbsp;Once a domain goes live on the blockchain and is transferred to your control (that is, to your crypto-wallet, alterable or transferrable only via a private key you personally hold), it is 100% under your own ownership and custody.\nUnstoppable Domains will not be able to refund your purchase funds or repossess the domain name.\nHowever, if you agree to cover the fees associated with transferring the domain back to Unstoppable Domains, we can refund the original purchase once the domain is received, provided the refund is requested within the timelines above.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, <strong>refunds to the original payment method will only be available on claimed domains if you return the domain to the Unstoppable Domains corporate account, and pay any blockchain fees or gas fees necessary to transfer it back.</strong> Unstoppable Domains will not refund any such fees.&nbsp;If you have received any store credit or promotional credit or items in connection with your purchase of a domain and wish to receive a refund for the original purchase, you must transfer the purchased domain back to our corporate account, and must forfeit any additional promotional items or credits granted in connection with the purchase, including additional domains bought with promotional credit granted by the original purchase.\nIf you have minted any domains bought with promotional credit granted by the original purchase, you must also return these domains to our corporate account in order to receive a refund.&nbsp;All purchases made with promotional credits are NON-REFUNDABLE, and are not eligible for exchanges under any circumstances.\nDomains purchased with promotion credits cannot be exchanged for alternative or equivalent products, even when a typo is made.&nbsp;Any additional fees paid for preorders, \u201csunrise\u201d registration, or any other early access programs, spent domain minting and twitter verification credits are non-refundable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES</b>You may not access or use the Site for any purpose other than
