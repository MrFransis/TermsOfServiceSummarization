pandemic.\n<strong>Learn more.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Last Updated: June 17, 2019</p>Information for Law Enforcement Authorities<p>sp0n, Inc (d/b/a Citizen) is a mobile phone application available through the Apple App Store and Google Play.\nThe application provides a new way to monitor incidents that occur in real time.\nUsers receive information from the app about an incident, then can take a video using their camera phone or send chat messages in real time.\nThe purpose of this guide is to familiarize U.S.\nlaw enforcement agencies with the categories of information available from Citizen and the specific legal process necessary to compel that information.</p>Review Process<p>When Citizen receives a legal request from a law enforcement agency, another government agency, a lawyer representing a criminal defendant, or a civil litigant, the first step is for our team to review the request to determine if it meets relevant legal requirements, including both statutory requirements and the Constitutional interests of Citizen and its users, specifically including freedom of speech, expression, assembly, and association as well as freedom of the press.\nIf the request meets all relevant legal requirements, our team then checks that the information is still available and has not already been deleted, either as part of our regular data-retention practices or by the user.\nAs part of its review for legal sufficiency, Citizen may ask the requester for additional information or context before making any responsive disclosure or may reject the request in its entirety due to legal insufficiency or defects (e.g.\nthe request is overly broad, the request is technically deficient due to failure to provide required information, the request seeks content with insufficient legal process, or the request appears impermissibly to burden the Constitutional rights of Citizen or its users).\nFor valid and properly scoped requests to which Citizen does not object, our team will assemble the required records and produce them to the requester.\nOnce the records have been produced, the case is considered completed and closed.</p>Contact Information<p>Citizen accepts service via email and mail:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email: lawenforcement@citizen.com.</li>\n<li>Mailing Address: PO Box 55071 #92726 Boston, Massachusetts 02205-5071</li>\n</ul>Form of Requests<p>We will be unable to process overly broad or vague requests.\nAll requests must identify requested records with particularity, including the specific data categories requested and date limitations for the request, as well as include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The name of the law enforcement agency and issuing agent, email address from a law-enforcement domain, and direct contact phone number.</li>\n<li>The username of the account.\nIf you are unable to locate a username, Citizen will make a reasonable attempt to locate the account with a phone number or email address.</li>\n</ul>U.S.\nLegal Process Requirements<p>We disclose user information solely in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law, including the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (\u201cECPA\u201d), 18 U.S.C.\nSections 2701-2712.\nUnder U.S.\nlaw:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A valid subpoena issued in connection with an official criminal investigation is required to compel the disclosure of basic subscriber records (defined in 18 U.S.C.\nSection 2703(c)(2)), which may include: username, email address(es), phone number(s), account creation date, and a recent login/logout IP address(es), if available.</li>\n<li>A court order issued under 18 U.S.C.\nSection 2703(d) is required to compel the disclosure of certain records or other information pertaining to the account, not including contents of communications, which may include video and chat metadata and IP addresses associated with account activity, in addition to the basic subscriber records identified above.</li>\n<li>A search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause is required to compel the disclosure of the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, photos, videos, chat messages, and location information.</li>\n<li>We interpret the national security letter provision as applied to Citizen to require the production of only 2 categories of information: name and length of service.</li>\n</ul>International Legal Process Requirements<p>International governmental and law enforcement agencies must use Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (\u201cMLAT\u201d) or letters rogatory processes to compel the disclosure of information.\nInternational law enforcement agencies may use this guide to help them understand how Citizen works, but the legal process and emergency disclosure provisions described in this guide apply only to U.S.\nagencies.</p>Preservation Requests<p>We will take steps to preserve account information in connection with official criminal investigations for 90 days pending our receipt of formal legal process in accordance with 18 U.S.C.\nSection 2703(f).\nWe will extend the preservation for an additional 90 days upon receipt of a renewed request.</p>Data Retention and Availability<p>We will search for and disclose data that is specified with particularity in an appropriate form of legal process and which we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.\nWe do not retain data for law enforcement purposes unless we receive a valid preservation request before a user has deleted that content from our service.</p>\n<p>The basic identity information entered by a user in creating an account is maintained as long as the user has not edited the data or removed the information from the account.\nOnce the user makes a change, the previously existing information is overwritten.\nUpon receipt of a preservation request, however, Citizen can capture the user data available at that time, and future actions by the user will not affect the preserved data.</p>Emergency Requests<p>In responding to a matter involving imminent harm to a child or risk of death or serious physical injury to any person and requiring disclosure of information without delay in accordance with 18 U.S.C.\nSections 2702(b)(8) and 2702(c)(4), a law enforcement official may submit a request to lawenforcement@citizen.com.\nNote: We will not review or respond to requests submitted by non-law enforcement officials.\nUsers aware of an emergency situation should immediately and directly contact local law enforcement officials.</p>Child Safety Matters<p>We report all apparent instances of child exploitation appearing on our site from anywhere in the world to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), including content drawn to our attention by government requests.\nNCMEC coordinates with the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children and law enforcement authorities from around the world.\nIf a request relates to a child exploitation or safety matter, please specify those circumstances (and include relevant NCMEC report identifiers) in the request to ensure that we are able to address these matters expeditiously and effectively.</p>Testimony<p>Citizen does not provide expert testimony support.\nIn addition, Citizen records are self-authenticating pursuant to law and should not require the testimony of a records custodian.\nIf a special form of certification is required, please attach it to your records request.</p>Cost Reimbursement<p>We may seek reimbursement for costs in responding to requests for information as provided by law.\nThese fees apply on a per account basis.\nWe may also charge additional fees for costs incurred in responding to unusual or burdensome requests.</p>\n<p>We may waive these fees in matters investigating potential harm to children, Citizen, and our users, and emergency requests.</p>Legal Advice<p>Citizen cannot provide legal advice to law enforcement officials.\nAs such, should you seek further clarification about ECPA\u2019s restrictions on providers like Citizen, we suggest you contact the Department of Justice\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) at 202- 514-1026 and ask to speak to the Duty Attorney.</p>Company<ul>\n<li>Careers</li>\n<li>Mission</li>\n<li>Explore</li>\n</ul>Support<ul>\n<li>Support</li>\n<li>Privacy</li>\n<li>Terms</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n</ul>\u00a9

2020</p>Data Privacy at Citizen<p>Citizen\u2019s mission is to keep you safe and informed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>At Citizen (as in sp0n, Inc the company that operates the Citizen mobile app and www.citizen.com), our stance is that we will only use and share your data for the limited purposes described in this privacy policy.\nWe do not and will not serve advertisements in the app.</strong>\n</p>Citizen Privacy PracticesOur principles for protecting your data<ul>\n<li>We record the information we need to provide our services: Informing you of incidents happening around you, and helping you get emergency assistance when you\u2019re in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The personal information we do collect we store for as short a duration as possible.\nAnd, where possible, we store only de-identified or aggregate data that is not tied to you.</li>\n<li>We involve as few third-party service providers as possible when touching your data.\nThe third parties we work with have contracts in place to prohibit reuse or sale of your data.</li>\n<li>We generally limit access to your data to a subset of the engineering team.\nWe have specific systems to control data access, and all access is logged and regularly audited.\nWe perform a privacy review for all new features.</li>\n<li>We take protecting your location data seriously.\nWe need accurate real-time location data to alert you of any emergencies and to help you get emergency assistance, but we lower the resolution of historical location data where possible.</li>\n<li>We test the stability and security of our infrastructure, including annual penetration testing and review of our security systems and their configuration.\nWe use an information security firm to provide these services under a strict non-disclosure agreement.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Our services are designed to provide real-time notifications of incidents occurring near you, and to help you get assistance in the case of an emergency.\nWe can only provide those services in certain areas, so if you are located outside of one of those areas, the services may not work for you.\nWe only provide our service in the United States, so we apply U.S.\nlaw to our privacy practices.</li>\n</ul>Public data<ul>\n<li>Content visible to any other user on the Citizen platform is considered public data (for example, publicly posted comments and videos).\nYou have control over public data on Citizen tied to your account, and can delete comments and videos you have posted.\nFurthermore, you can email support@citizen.com to request to delete your account and coordinated information.</li>\n</ul>Private data&nbsp;<p>Content not publicly accessible to other users on the platform is considered private data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Contact information:</strong>&nbsp;We use your email address and phone number to set up and validate your user account and to prevent abuse of the platform.&nbsp.\nIf you subscribe to Citizen Protect, we will also collect your name.\nWe may also send you emails about Citizen \u2013 you can choose to opt out of any marketing emails by following the instructions at the bottom of the email, but we may still send you some important emails, such as to respond to a question, feedback, or request you send us.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment information:</strong>&nbsp;We will request your payment card details and billing address if you subscribe to paid features of the app, such as Citizen Protect.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Health information:</strong>&nbsp;If you elect to use Citizen Protect\u2019s Watch My Back feature, you may connect your phone or activity-tracking device, such as your Fitbit or Apple Watch, to share your walking pace and heart rate with the family members and friends you choose to watch over you in unsafe situations (your \u201cWatchers\u201d).&nbsp.\nIf you use Citizen Protect\u2019s SOS feature, you may also provide us with your medical history and other information that may be helpful to our staff and first responders to assist you in case of an emergency.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audio and video feed</strong>: If you use Citizen Protect, you may share an audio and video feed from your device with your Watchers and emergency contacts as well as with our agents when you\u2019re feeling unsafe.&nbsp.\nWe may record your audio conversations with our agents for quality assurance and legal purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User locations:</strong>&nbsp;We use your geolocation data to send you safety notifications for incidents reported near you and, if you sign up for Citizen Protect, to notify your Watchers, your emergency contacts, our agents, and first responders of your whereabouts.\nYou choose whether to share your location, and can always revoke Citizen\u2019s access to your location data in your device settings, but the app will not properly function if the app can\u2019t access location data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User activity:</strong>&nbsp;We aggregate user activity data (like how you interact with Citizen, what times you use Citizen, what kind of device you have, etc.) for analysis to improve Citizen\u2019s user experience.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User contacts:</strong>&nbsp;You can choose to share your contacts with us to connect with them through the app, to suggest you as a connection to other users, to inform your family and friends of incidents near you if you use Citizen\u2019s Inner Circle feature, or if you sign up for Citizen Protect, to invite family and friends to your subscription plan or designate them as Watchers or emergency contacts.\nIf another Citizen user shares their contacts with us, and you are one of those contacts, we may recommend to you that user and the user\u2019s contacts as friends to connect with on Citizen.\nJust as you can provide contact information about other users, they may share your information with us for the same purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content you capture through Citizen:</strong>&nbsp;If you use Citizen to capture a video or other content you wish to make publicly available, we collect and store that content and additional information about the content and device you used (like the metadata associated with the content, unique device identifier, wireless network, etc.).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;Like many online services, Citizen uses cookies to collect information on its website.\nWe may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to tailor your experience with Citizen, and advertise Citizen on third-party websites and apps.\nWe also work with Facebook and Google ads integrations.\nThese integrations allow us to track the efficacy of our own advertising campaigns across the web.\nWe do not use these integrations to provide any manner of advertising on the platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>How we share your information<p>We may share your data with service providers, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Branch:</strong>&nbsp;Branch allows us to attribute when content is shared from Citizen to the platform and source.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Twilio:</strong>&nbsp;Twilio allows us to send you an SMS message to validate your account, or to enable you to invite your contacts to the platform.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Google Cloud Services:</strong>&nbsp;We use Google to host our infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We only partner with service providers that commit to use the information only to provide services to or on behalf of Citizen.</p>\n<p>We may share videos posted publicly on the Citizen platform with news outlets in select circumstances.</p>\n<p>If you decide to provide us with your contact list, we may share some of your personal information, including your use of the Citizen app, with others to invite them to connect with you in the app or to suggest you as a connection to other users.</p>\n<p>If you use Citizen Protect\u2019s Watch My Back feature, we will share some of your personal information with the family members and friends you choose to be your Watchers to allow them to monitor your whereabouts and wellbeing.</p>\n<p>If you use Citizen Protect\u2019s SOS feature, we may share some of your personal information with first responders and your emergency contacts in the event that you are experiencing an emergency and request assistance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may share some or all of your personal information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction involving the sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of Citizen\u2019s business or assets.\nIn the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, personal information may also be transferred as a business asset.\nIf&nbsp;<strong>sp0n, Inc</strong>&nbsp;business or assets are acquired by another company, that company will possess the personal information collected by Citizen and the company will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We may share personal information (a) with law enforcement as we\u2019ve explained in the Information for Law Enforcement Authorities, (b) as otherwise required by law, (c) to enforce the terms and conditions that govern the platform and protection our rights, (d) and protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical or illegal activity.</p>How long we retain your data<p>We retain personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law, or an individual requests that we delete information about them.</p>How we protect your data<p>Citizen uses reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, misuse, loss, disclosure, alteration and destruction of personal information we maintain.\nUnfortunately, data transmission over the Internet cannot be guaranteed as completely secure.\nTherefore, while Citizen strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information.\nIn the event that Citizen is required to notify you about a situation involving your data, we may do so by email or telephone to the extent permitted by law.</p>What choices you have regarding your data<p>You can make the following choices regarding your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp;If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from Citizen for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.\nConsult your browser\u2019s technical information.\nIf you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all or portions of Citizen or all functionality of Citizen.\nIf you have any questions about how to disable or modify cookies, please let Citizen know at the contact information provided below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Application.</strong>&nbsp;You can stop all collection of information by the Citizen application by uninstalling the application.\nYou may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do-Not-Track.</strong>&nbsp;Some web browsers transmit \u201cdo not track\u201d signals to the websites and other online services with which your web browser communications.\nThere is currently no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.\nCitizen currently does not take action in response to these signals.\nIf and when a standard is established, Citizen may revise its policy on responding to these signals.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access or correct your information.</strong>&nbsp;You may request to review and update the information Citizen maintains about you by submitting a request to support@citizen.com.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opting Out of location tracking.</strong>&nbsp;If you initially consented to the collection of geo-location information through Citizen, you can subsequently

information, you may no longer be able to use some features of the app.</li>\n</ul>Notice to California users<p>We are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) to

to or on behalf of Citizen.</p>\n<p>We will alert users who were within nearby proximity of an affected user during the preceding 30 days.\nThese users will see a location on the map where the contact
