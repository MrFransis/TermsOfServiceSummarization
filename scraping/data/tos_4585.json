'Nir' and the prefix of the word 'Software'.\nHowever, there is another reason for choosing this name: My full name is 'Nir Sofer', so removing the 'er' letters and\nadding the 't' letter instead, also gives the same result - NirSoft.\n</p>\n<p> A Little History...\nNirSoft Web site was originally in created in 2001 as a personal Web site which provided a few utilities that I developed for my own use.\nIn the beginning, NirSoft was hosted in some \"free\" Web hosting services like Tripod and multiservers.com\n<br>\nUnfortunately, these \"free\" Web sites produced a fair amount of annoying popup ads and some of them even tried to install unwanted Spywares on the computer of the site visitors.\nAlso, after my site became pretty popular, they disabled my hosting account because I used too much resources on their server.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn August 2004, after suffering from all these free services, I decided to purchase a domain for my site (nirsoft.net) and host it in a non-free hosting service, in order make my Web site more reliable, friendly and secured.\nIn the days that I started with nirsoft.net domain, my site was already popular more than an average Web site, with more than\n90,000 unique visitors and 1.5 million hits in a month.\nThe most popular utilities in these days were IPNetInfo, Volumouse,\nMessenPass, and Protected Storage PassView.\nAll these utilities are still very popular even today.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the last 4 years, I added more and more utilities to my Web site, and today it contains more than 100 utilities.\nAs I added more utilities, the Web site traffic was also gradually increased, and today (May 2008) NirSoft Web site have more\nthan 850,000 unique visitors and 13.5 million hits in a month.\n<br>\nDuring these years, I also made some changes in the utilities according the users requests.\nFor example - In the beginning, all utilities saved the settings into a Registry key under\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\NirSoft.\nBut after many users complained about the keys that I added to the Registry,\nI decided to save the settings into a file, and today most of the utilities save the settings into a .cfg file\nlocated in the same folder of the .exe file.\nThis means that my utilities can be used directly from a USB Flash Drive, without leaving any traces in the computer itself.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring these years, I also developed a unique translation system that automatically allows any simple user to easily\ntranslate my tools to another language.\nToday, the most popular utilities have translations to more than 20 languages,\nall of them were created by volunteers from around the world.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the last year, I also added a 64-bit (x64) build for some of my utilities, and for some other utilities I added separated Unicode download (For good multilingual support) and Non-Unicode download (for Windows 98/ME users).\nI also fixed most of my utilities to work properly under Windows Vista.\n</p>\n<p> \"False Positive\" Issues As my Web site became more popular, a very annoying problem started to appear frequently: \"False Positive\" alerts in AntiVirus software.\nThis means that AntiVirus/AntiSpyware programs detect my utilities as infected with Virus/Trojan/Spyware while my utilities are clean from any malicious code.\nEach time that a popular AntiVirus software begins to detect one of my utilities as Virus or Trojan,\nmy email is flooded with messages from worried people that think my Web site is infected with Viruses.\nSome of them even blame me that I spread Viruses through my Web site.\nBut the truth is that I have never had any Virus/Trojan/Spyware in my tools.\nAll the alerts and warnings displayed by the AntiVirus programs regarding my utilities are simply wrong, and cause a widespread panic without a reason.\n</p>\n<p>\nDue to the large amount of \"False Positive\" alerts, I created a special Web page that displays the major \"False Positive\" problems with NirSoft utilities: False Positive Reports\n</p>\n<p>\nThis Web page is also message to all Antivirus companies that they must improve the quality and the\nreliability of their Virus detection mechanism.\n</p>\n<p> Advantages of NirSoft utilities For almost every utility that you can find here, there is probably others alternative tools with similar functionality.\nHowever, NirSoft utilities have some unique advantages over many other freeware and commercial products: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of the utilities in this site were developed in C++, which make them fast, small and effective.\n</li>\n<li>My utilities are portable and mostly don't require any installation.\nWhile many software companies create a bloated installation package with size of 1 - 3 MB, the size of single utility in NirSoft is usually less than 100KB.\n</li>\n<li>All my utilities (except of a few very old tools) don't write anything to the Registry or to your profile folder.\nThis means that you can use them from a USB Flash drive, without leaving traces in the computer that you use.\n</li>\n<li>Most of my utilities can be used from command-line, without displaying any user interface.\n</li>\n<li>You don't have to register or give your email in order to download from NirSoft.\n</li>\n<li>My utilities don't collect any personal information from your computer and they will never send any information to anyone.\n</li>\n<li>My utilities are completely freeware, without any catch.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Privacy Policy of NirSoft Web site </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal Information Collected on this Website:\nNo personally-identifiable information is collected on this website from persons that browse this Web site or from persons that run and use my utilities.\nThe only personally-identifiable information collected on this website is gathered on my \"Contact NirSoft\" page, where fields are provided so that you can provide your name and email address contact information.\nThis information is sent directly to my email and it only used to respond your comments.\nYou user name/email information is not saved in any database.\n</li>\n<li>Anonymous Information Collected on this Website:\nAnonymous data is recorded on this Web site.\nMost of the information collected from this website is anonymous information, such as the pages you visit.\nOther anonymous data I may collect might include the name of your internet service provider, the website that you used to link to my site, the websites that you visit from our site, and your IP address.\nThe data is only used for statistical purposes, but you, as the individual user, remain anonymous.\n</li>\n<li>Cookies:\nCookies are used on this website by Google and other third party advertising companies.\nYou can get more information about how cookies are used in Google advertising system in the following Web pages:\n<br>\nHow Google uses cookies in advertising\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul> &nbsp.\n<p>\n</p> &nbsp;&nbsp.\n<p>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-07-06 17:59:20.449406", "updated_at": "2021-07-07 12:16:54.203345"}], "points": [], "urls": ["nirsoft.net"]}}
