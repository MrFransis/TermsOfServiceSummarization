Commission for agreements governing the transfer of personal data outside the EU.\nThey may also be used to transfer data to the US.\nWhile Switzerland is not bound by any CJEU judgment, we will no longer rely on the Swiss-US Privacy Shield alone.</p>\n<p>Getty Images will continue to comply with its commitments under its\u202fPrivacy Shield certification\u202fdespite the CJEU ruling.\nCustomers can continue to use Getty Images' services in compliance with EU data\u202fprivacy\u202flaw.\nTo the extent a transfer of EU customer\u202fdata to the US is required for Getty Images to perform services for its EU customers, Getty Images has intracompany SCCs in place to validate the transfer.\nAs the SCCs remain a valid method of transfer under the CJEU ruling, customers can continue to rely on these SCCs as a compliant method to transfer customer data from the EU to the U.S.</p>\n<p>Your data may be shared with the following US-based Getty Images affiliates: (a) Getty Images (Seattle), Inc..\n(b) Getty Images (US), Inc..\n(c) Getty Images News Services (PRC), Inc..\nand (d) Getty Images, Inc.\nAlthough Getty Images no longer relies on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data, but instead the SCCs, we maintain our adherence to the Privacy Shield principles based on Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.</p>\n<p>We are still subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nIf third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of Privacy Shield, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield principles, the Privacy Shield principles shall govern.</p>\n<p>If you have a question or complaint related to our data privacy processes, we encourage you to contact us as indicated at the bottom of this privacy statement.\nFor any complaints that cannot be resolved with us directly, you may refer the matter to JAMS by going to https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.\nJAMS provides an independent third-party dispute resolution body based in the United States.\nJAMS has committed to respond to complaints and to provide appropriate recourse at no cost to you.\nWe will cooperate with JAMS pursuant to the JAMS International Mediation Rules, which are accessible on the JAMS website at\u202fhttp://www.jamsadr.com.\n\u202fGiven that JAMS' affiliated Regional Center outside of the United States is based in the United Kingdom, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has jurisdiction if you are located in the UK for any cross-border processing activity, or if you are resident in an EU country, under the GDPR you may contact the supervisory authority in your country.\nIf neither Getty Images nor JAMS resolves your complaint, you may have the possibility to engage in binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel or otherwise seek a resolution as set out in the SCCs.\nWe are committed to protecting the\u202fprivacy\u202fof our customers' data.\u202fWe will continue to monitor and evaluate new guidance as it emerges.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing of Your Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, Getty Images does not share your personal data with any outside parties.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We share personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete your transactions or provide the products or services you have requested or authorized.\nWe may also share your personal data within our corporate group, including with our subsidiaries, affiliates, and divisions, all of whom may use your data for the purposes disclosed herein.\nIn addition, we may share your personal data with our approved and appointed distributor network.</p>\n<p>We may share your personal data with service providers who perform services on our behalf.\nFor example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in direct marketing, analyze your interests and preferences and to conduct audits, etc.\nThose companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal data they need to provide the service.\nThey are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.\nGetty Images maintains contracts with these third parties requiring their treatment (access, use and disclosure) of personal data to be consistent with our obligations under the law.</p>\n<p>Information about our customers, including personal data, may be disclosed as part of any merger, transfer, divestiture, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of the company and/or its assets, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which personal data would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company.\nWe will notify you of such an occurrence as described in the \"Changes to This Privacy Policy\" section below.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal data if we have a good faith understanding we are required to do so by law (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or in the good-faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or protect the rights, property or safety of our company, employees, customers, or the public.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retention of Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary significantly based on criteria such as user expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable users to delete data, and our legal or contractual obligations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>\n</p>\n<p>On some pages, we allow you to share personal data with third parties, such as social networks like Facebook.\nIn these instances, you are agreeing to the data being shared and the shared data is subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.\nWe may combine information we receive from those platforms (e.g., profile information, likes, pageviews) with other information we collect from you or other sources and use and disclose it as described in this privacy policy.\nExcept where required by applicable law or regulation, we do not control and do not assume any responsibility for the use of personal data by such third parties.\nFor more information about the third party's purpose and scope of their use of personal data in connection with sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of these third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Accessing Your Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you would like to review or revise information that you previously provided to us, you may access your information in the \"My Account\" section of the website.\nYour Account Executive can also assist you in making any changes, as well as in exercising your right to have your personal data deleted.\nIf you need additional assistance, please contact us at privacy@gettyimages.com.\nYou can expect a response from us within 30 days.\nPlease be advised that you cannot change your username without re-registering.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Getty Images uses \"cookies\" and other technologies like pixel tags, web beacons and similar technologies (\"Cookies\") to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize and improve your online experience.\nA cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive or device.\nCookies contain information, including personal data that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the Cookie to you.\nThe information that Cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, and your navigational and purchase history.\nPixel tags, also called web beacons, are clear image (i.e., non-visible) files that may be placed on a website, in an email or newsletter, and request information from your device such as your browser type and may assist us in determining your engagement with the content of the website and emails we send, how many users have visited certain pages, or how users have otherwise engaged with our messages or newsletters.\nWe may use web beacons to help deliver cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies offer you many conveniences:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>We use cookies for a variety of legitimate purposes, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access Boards and shopping carts and view their previous invoices.</li>\n<li>Cookies save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information.</li>\n<li>Cookies enable us to see what actions you take on this site and other websites.\nThis allows us to deliver personalized content to you and other users, including search results and interest-based targeted advertising on our site and other websites.</li>\n<li>Cookies help to protect your security by checking your login details and may help prevent fraud.</li>\n<li>Cookies remember your preferences when using the site.</li>\n<li>Cookies also identify particular customers in the event such customer would like assistance from a live, online customer service representative.</li>\n</ol>\nWe strive to make this site and our family of sites, user-friendly and relevant.\nOur goal is to deliver more personalized products and services to you.<br>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br>Analytics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our websites may include Cookies from third-party service providers.\nIn some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide services on our behalf, such as site analytics.\nFor this purpose, Getty Images works with various third-party partners like Amazon, Facebook and Google to see what actions you take on third party websites to deliver our personalized ads to you via third party websites.\nWe use Demographics and Interest reporting features in Google Analytics to inform our requests to our service providers.</p>\n<p>Our third-party partners like Google use Cookies on our site to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Measure and analyze aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our users on our site.\nInformation gathered may include, but is not limited to the following: activity of the user browser when the user is visiting the site, the site path of users, general information regarding the visitor's internet service provider and host, and the time users come to the site.</li>\n<li>Remember our users' previous search of products and services, and dynamically display more relevant content to them.</li>\n<li>Record users' behavior on our site, such as pages visited, emails clicked, forms completed and products and services purchased to create customized advertisements and communications that better meet your needs.</li>\n<li>Evaluate user traffic and behavior on the site to compile activity reports.</li>\n<li>Conduct research and diagnostics to improve our products and services.</li>\n<li>Identify users arriving at the site via a referral from an affiliate website or sponsored link.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.\nLearn more about privacy at Google here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Advertising</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In other cases, we allow third parties to use Cookies for advertising purposes.\nSometimes our web pages contain content or ads from third parties, such as videos, news content, or ads delivered by other ad networks.\nBecause your browser connects to those third parties' web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your device and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.\nWe also work with third party partners to show their advertisements to you on our and third- party websites.\nOur partners may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising to be targeted to the users for whom they are most pertinent.\nThis means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads.</p>\n<p>Third-party advertising partners who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) are listed at the sites below.\nThese sites provide a simple way to opt out of ad targeting from those participating companies, which you can access

authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates.</li>\n<li>\nMarketing Emails: If you do not wish to receive marketing emails, you will have the option of opting out and/or unsubscribing from

prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after you opt-out.</li>\n<li>\nMobile Devices: Use your mobile device settings to stop or limit interest-based advertising on that device.\nFor instructions for using the advertising choice mechanisms provided by the most popular mobile operating systems, visit the NAI's Mobile Choices page at:

you do not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our websites do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.\nInstead, you can use the range of other tools to control data collection and use, including the cookie controls and advertising controls described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>European Data Protection
