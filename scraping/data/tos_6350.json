\u2013 June 30, 2021</p>\n<p>Appcast, Inc.\n(\u201cAppcast\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a job advertising technology service.\nWe also own and operate several websites (e.g., www.appcast.io).</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes (i) the types of information we collect when you use our websites (the \u201cwebsites\u201d), interact with our products, services, or applications (the \u201cService\u201d) in any manner.\n(ii) how we use the information we collect.\n(iii) with whom and why we share it.\nand (iv) the choices we offer regarding our use of the information.\nWe also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how to contact us about our privacy practices.</p>What Information Do We Collect?<p>We gather various types of information, including information that identifies or may identify you as an individual (\u201cpersonal information\u201d) as explained in more detail below.</p>\n<strong>Information You Provide Us</strong>\n<p>We receive and store personal information you submit directly to us.\nFor example, when you register as a user of the Service, you submit basic personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, and physical address, and we collect and maintain your user ID and password, which you create and provide to us.\nWhen you fill out a hosted job application or submit your interest in certain job vacancies using a version of the Service where we host that submission process, we collect the personal information that you submit as part of that form in order to process that application, including your name, email address, physical address, and phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also ask for your responses to employment-related questions, such as whether you know how to use certain software products, are available to work at night or have sufficient work-related permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also enable you to upload a copy of your resume or CV.\nWe do not control what information is included in your resume or CV, but we encourage you to refrain from including sensitive personal information such as your Social Security Number, identification numbers, or financial account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we may collect additional information related to your job application and prospective employment.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Information&nbsp;Collected Through Technology</strong>\n<strong>Through the Service</strong>\n<p>To provide the Service, we collect certain information from job applicants using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, when they click on an Appcast-sponsored job ad at third party websites, and when job applicants start and complete a job application at your website or a website operated by your applicant tracking system, and when certain points of the recruitment process (for example an interview or hire) have been completed.\nThe information we collect in this manner may include IP address, browser type, device type, operating system, referring URLs, dates and times of site visits, and predictive demographic information that does not identify you individually.\nWe anonymize IP addresses by hashing or truncating them.&nbsp.\nA cookie is a text file that websites send to a user\u2019s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the device and browser or to store information or settings in a browser.\nA web beacon, also known as an Internet tag or pixel tag, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.\nID syncing is a methodology for securely and privately making associations between two or more web servers about certain actions for attribution and ad optimization purposes.\nWe may also enable third parties to use cookies, web beacons, and ID syncing to collect information when you click on an Appcast-powered job ad at third party websites, when job applicants start and complete a job application for a job vacancy, and when certain points of the recruitment process (for example an interview or hire) have been completed.</p>\n<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but browser settings can be changed to prevent these cookies from collecting information.\nDisabling cookies does not necessarily disable the use of pixel tags, web beacons and other technologies that collect information.</p>\n<p>Unless you include it in your resume or CV, we do not collect the following information, and we urge you to exclude this information from your resume:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social Security Number, Driver\u2019s License Number, or other personally identifying numbers</li>\n<li>Payment card information or other financial information.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Through the Websites</strong>\n<p>Our websites collect certain information related to your

RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Ownership of Intellectual Property</u>.\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement conveys a limited right to use the Service and the Appcast Software and does not convey title or ownership of the Service or the Appcast Software, to Customer.\nThe Service and Appcast Software and related source code, web beacons, pixels, and any and all materials relating thereto, including all associated intellectual property rights, shall remain at all times the sole, exclusive property of Appcast and its licensors.&nbsp.\nCustomer agrees and acknowledges that the Appcast Software contains the valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Appcast and its licensors.&nbsp.\nAppcast acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Customer Data and Customer Aggregate Data is Confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party excepted as required for the fulfillment of Service.\nand (ii) Customer has the right to create derivate works based on the Output for Customer\u2019s internal purposes, and Customer has all right, title and interest in and to such derivative works.</p>\n<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Suggestions</u>.&nbsp.\nCustomer grants to Appcast a royalty-free, worldwide, transferrable, sub-licensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the Services or Appcast Software any suggestions, enhancements requests, recommendations, or other feedback provide by Customer or any User relating to the Services or Appcast Software.</p>\n<p>3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Aggregate Data</u>.&nbsp.\nAs between Customer and Appcast, Appcast owns all rights, title and interest in and to Aggregate Data.&nbsp.\nAccordingly, Appcast may, during the Term and thereafter, use display, transmit, modify and prepare derivative works of Aggregate Data in any media for any lawful purpose, including maintaining and improving the Service and Appcast Software.</p>\n<p>3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Security</u>.&nbsp.\nCustomer shall take all commercially reasonable steps to ensure that no unauthorized persons have access to the Service or Appcast Software, and to ensure that no Authorized Users shall take any action which would be in violation of this Agreement.&nbsp.\nSuch

Service.</p>\n<p>3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Reporting</u>.&nbsp.\nCustomer shall promptly report to Appcast any actual or suspected violation of Sections 2 and/or 3 hereof and shall take such further steps as may reasonably be requested by Appcast to prevent or remedy any such violation.</p>\n<p>3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Relief</u>.&nbsp.\nBecause unauthorized use of the Service is likely to substantially diminish the value of such Service and irreparably harm Appcast and may not be susceptible to cure by the payment of monetary damages, if Customer breaches the provisions of Sections 2 or 3 of this Agreement, Appcast shall be entitled to seek injunctive and/or other equitable relief, in addition to other remedies afforded by law, to prevent or restrain a breach of Sections 2 or 3 of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nFEES, PAYMENT, AND

maximum rate permitted by applicable law.\nCustomer has a financial obligation to pay Designated Managed Service Publishers.&nbsp.\nFor avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Appcast be obligated to remit payments to Designated Managed Service Publishers if Appcast has not yet received full and satisfactory payment for all prior payments owed to the Designated Managed Service Publisher from the Customer.&nbsp.\nCustomer agrees that it is ultimately obligated to remit payment to Designated Managed Service Publisher and Appcast is acting solely as an agent for Customer in collecting payments from the Customer and remitting them to the Designated Managed Service Publisher.\nIf a Designated Managed Service Publisher requires a deposit of funds for Recruitment Media expenditures, Customer shall deposit such funds with Appcast before Appcast makes any expenditures on Customer\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Collections</u>.&nbsp.\nCustomer shall pay all of Appcast\u2019s costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 and auditors\u2019 fees) if legal action is required to collect outstanding balances of undisputed amounts or to enforce any of Appcast\u2019s other rights hereunder or at law.</p>\n<p>4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Payment Terms.\nTaxes</u>.\nAll amounts due hereunder are payable in U.S.\nDollars.\nFees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, including without limitation, sales, use, value-added, and withholding taxes, and Customer shall pay all such taxes when due (other than taxes on Appcast\u2019s net income).&nbsp.\nAny bids tracked in a non-US currency, shall be subject to the same payment terms as outlined on Page 1 of this Agreement.&nbsp.\nOn the day following last day of the month, Customer will use the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reported currency conversion rate, with exception if the last day is a weekend or recognized federal holiday in the country of which the bids occurred in which case Customer will use the next business day.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nUSER DATA</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Customer Data Warranty</u>.&nbsp.\nCustomer

and Appcast Software and related source code, web beacons, pixels, and any and all materials relating thereto, including all associated intellectual property rights, shall remain at all times the sole, exclusive property of Appcast and its licensors.\nCustomer agrees and acknowledges that the Appcast Software contains the valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Appcast and its
