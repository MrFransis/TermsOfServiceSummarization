service where Nintendo's game consoles <i>Wii</i> and <i>DS</i>\ncan log in.\nBecause the website and the service are closely linked and the website displays\ndata about the service, there is a common privacy policy statement.\nCookies and JavaScript This website uses cookies and JavaScript to store the preferences of visitors\nand to enable a good performance.\nBoth are needed for interactive content.\n<p>\nThe cookies are only so-called session cookies.\nThis is needed to identify the visitors after changing a page or for\nnew visits after timeouts.\nThe data for the session is archived in a database.\nFor guests, these sessions are automatically deleted after 20 days\nafter the last visit, or earlier.\nThe timeout for logged-in users is 100 days.\nDeleting the session invalidates the cookie and makes it unusable.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you do not want to use cookies or JavaScript,\nthen you can make appropriate settings on your browser\nor avoid visiting this website.\n</p>Resources by third parties This website does not use any resources or cookies from other websites.\nThis prevents tracking by third parties.\nUser accounts of Wiimmfi <i>Wiimmfi</i> does not manage its own user accounts,\nbut uses the user accounts of the Wii-Homebrew Forums.\nTo log in, users must have a valid and active account there.\nLogin name and password are then compared to the forum via a so-called bridge.\nThis login is not tracked by the forum.\n<p>\nThe only data transferred from the forum is the username.\nFurther information is not necessary for the operation of Wiimmfi\nand will not be taken from the forum.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe public will not see the usernames.\nWiimmfi also provides no communication options for users among each other.\nTherefore, the forum is used for all communication,\nwhich also supports private messages.\nThis communication channel should also be used when contacting the Wiimmfi team.\n</p>Miscellaneous No personal data is collected by this web site.\nThe usual log files are only used in the case of security\nand regularly deleted with a time delay.\nA transfer of the data to third parties outside this security is excluded.\n<p>\nFor statistic purposes, special log files are created containing only\nthe time and web page and a few more statistical data.\nIP address, used browser or similar information about single visitors\nis not stored.\n</p>The Wiimmfi service Nintendo discontinued its online service <i>WFC</i> in May 2014.\nWiimmfi has jumped in the breach and provides a replacement service for free.\nFor this, the games must be patched to use the the new server.\nThe data protocol had to be taken over unchanged with all its weaknesses.\n<p>\nWhen logging in to the Wiimmfi service, the console (Nintendo <i>Wii</i> or <i>DS</i>)\nprovides data used to administer, ban, and display real-time statistics on the website.\nThe storage and control of the data is necessary for the technical process of the\nWiimmfi service.\nIn particular, these data are used to improve Wiimmfi,\nas not all details of the protocol are known.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe web page publicly displays the player names transmitted by the console.\nTherefore, no real name should be used.\nUsually, statistics about the games are available for up to 3 days.\n</p>\n<p>\nAutomatic linking of game data and the user account is not technically possible.\nHowever, any logged-in user of the Wiimmfi website can manually link consoles\nto his account.\nThe link is only visible to the logged in user and moderators.\n</p>\n<p>\nData is collected for various statistics that go beyond years.\nMost of the statistics are published on the website\nwhile preserving the personal anonymity.\nThe long-term statistics are only counters,\ne.g.\nthe number of logins per period counts, but not the time of login.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor continuous improvement of the service, at times and without notice,\nsignificant logs will be created on the data provided by the game console.\nThese logs are activated and evaluated only when needed and depending on the game.\nAfter the final evaluation they will be deleted.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>If you decline the described processing of the data of your console,\nthen you must use another alternative service for Nintendo's WFC!</b>\n</p>Moderators and Bans Moderators have access to the game data for up to 4 weeks,\nto resolve conflicts with hindsight.\nThey can ban consoles on different kinds.\nA ban can be temporary or permanent.\nPermanent bans are usually used on repeated offenses.\nFor this, the data of each individual ban must be archived permanently.\nA note about accessing third-party servers Some games are programmed by the game makers\nthat they access other servers managed by third parties.\nWithout these third-party servers,\nthe games would not work anymore or only partially work.\nWiimmfi has no influence on the behavior of the games and also\nnot on the operators of the third-party servers or their privacy policy.\nAgree this Privacy Policy\n", "created_at": "2021-02-10 10:22:05.984723", "updated_at": "2021-03-22 20:45:59.707978"}],
