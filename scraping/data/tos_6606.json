documentation regarding any use of its Site, Services, and/or other systems at any time.\nOur Privacy Policy sets forth the only expectations of privacy any individual has in regards to his or her use of Company\u2019s Site, Services, or other systems.\nUnless required by law, Company will never release your individual-level Genetic Information and/or Phenotypic Information to any third party without asking for and receiving your explicit consent to do so.\nFurther, you acknowledge and agree that Company is free to preserve and disclose any and all Personal Information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process or obligations that Company

otherwise, each new feature that augments or enhances the current Service shall be subject to these Terms of Use.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided \"AS-IS\" and are based on the current state of the art of genetic research and technology in use by Company at the time of the purchase or viewing.\nCompany is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services that Company provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you.\nAs part of this

Company's sole discretion, without prior notice to you.\nYou may stop using the Services at any time.\nYou do not need to specifically inform Company when you stop using the Services unless you are

information we provide to you regarding your Genetic Data and/or Phenotypic Information will be positive or welcome.\nIn fact, such information may be negative and unwelcome.\nYou may learn things that you may not have the ability to control or change.\nYou may learn things that are deeply distressing.\nThese outcomes may have psychological, social, legal, or financial implications.\nYou should also understand that as research advances you might need to obtain further services in order to utilize such information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2.\nThe Services Do Not Constitute Medical Advice.</strong> The Genetic Information provided by Company through its Services, which include without limitation the Site, Company\u2019s Apps, and third party Apps, including those hosted by Company or elsewhere, is purely for research, informational, and educational use only.\nThe Services are not intended to diagnose an illness, condition, or disease, and are not a substitute for professional medical advice.\nYou should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.\nCompany does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Site.\nIf Company provides you with information based on your Genetic Data and/or Phenotypic Information this information is intended only for informational purposes and discussion with your physician or other healthcare provider.\nDo not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of information from Company.&nbsp.\nFor most common diseases, the genes we know of are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk.\nOther predictors include unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle choices.\nIf your data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.\nThe opposite is also true.\nif your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively develop the disease or condition.\nIn either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through Company, you should contact your physician or other health care provider.\nOnly a trained physician or other health care provider can assess your current state of health or disease, taking into account many factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current symptoms, if any.\nReliance on any information provided by Company, Company employees, others appearing on our website at the invitation of Company, or other visitors to our website is solely at your own risk.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.3.\nLaboratory Processing and Errors.</strong> Company is not a laboratory, nor does it perform genetic testing.\nCompany has no control over the validity or accuracy of your genetic testing results and the related genetic data files that the lab produces.\nAs this possibility is known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds when invalid or inaccurate genetic testing results occur.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4.\nSharing Genetic Information.\n</strong>The Site allows you to share your Genetic Data files and any related outputs from Apps with other Users.\nAny such sharing that you undertake is solely in your discretion and at your own risk.\nYou should be careful about sharing your Genetic Data with others.\nCurrently, very few businesses or insurance companies request Genetic Data, but this could change in the future.\nWhile current state and federal law provide protection against discrimination by employers and health insurance companies the exact contours of such protection has not been clearly established.\nIn addition, current federal and state law does not apply to life or disability insurance providers.\nYou may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Data before you share it with anybody.\nFor non-Membership accounts, the Site allows you to designate one or more of your Genetic Data files as an \u201cAltruist File.\u201d All Genetic Data in a designated Altruist File is deidentified and made available to other Users as part of Company\u2019s \u201cAltruist Database\u201d.\nYour Genetic Data will never be shared with anyone or added to the Altruist Database unless you specifically provide permission for such sharing.\nPlease note that any Genetic Data shared prior to your decision to unshare your Genetic Data cannot be undone.\nhowever, following your decision to unshare your Genetic Data, no further Users or other persons will be allowed to view your Genetic Data.\nFor Membership accounts, all Genetic Data stored in a Membership account is Altruist Data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\n<u>Customer Accounts, Passwords, and Security</u>.</strong> In consideration of your use of the Services, you agree to provide and regularly update, as applicable, true, accurate, current, and complete Registration Information.\nUpon registering an account, you will be prompted to create a password and account designation.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.\nIf you allow third parties to access Company's website through your username and password, you will defend and indemnify Company and its affiliates against any liability, costs, or damages, including attorney fees, arising out of claims or suits by such third parties based upon or relating to such access and use.\nYou agree to immediately notify Company of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and to ensure that you sign out of your account at the end of each session.\nCompany cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\n<u>User Representations and
