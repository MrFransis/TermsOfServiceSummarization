Information <p> (a)\tThis agreement governs your use of Spreadshirt's site and service, including all orders made or processed for products or services in connection with the site and service.\nYou and Spreadshirt Inc., a Delaware corporation providing custom, on-demand merchandise printing, sales, and other related services (\"Spreadshirt\"), are the parties to this agreement.\nIf you choose to use other features of the site and service, like opening a shop to sell custom, print-on-demand products, other terms may apply in addition to these.\nNo exceptions to these terms are effective unless Spreadshirt has agreed to them in writing.<br>\n<br> (b) Spreadshirt may change these terms from time to time.\nIf Spreadshirt makes changes to these terms, you will be notified and asked to accept the new terms as a condition of continuing to use Spreadshirt's site and service.\nIf you disagree with any amendments, you must stop using Spreadshirt's site and service.\n<br>\n<br> (c) Haga clic aqu\u00ed para <strong>la versi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola.</strong>\n</p> 2.\nUse of the Site and Service Generally <p> (a) Spreadshirt owns all intellectual property and other rights, title and interest in and to its site and service (except for user-provided content).\nYour use of the site and service does not grant you any right, title or interest to these properties, except as follows.\nSpreadshirt grants you a limited, revocable license to access and use the site and service for its intended purpose: the provision of an online, on-demand, customizable merchandising solution.\nYou may only use the site and service according to Spreadshirt's terms, rules, and guidelines found on its site, and Spreadshirt may revoke this license and limit your access to the site and service according to Section 15 (Termination of Access).<br>\n<br> (b)\tYou may not </p>\n<ol>\n<li> interfere with the site and service by using viruses or any other programs or technology designed to disrupt or damage any software or hardware.\n</li>\n<li>modify, copy, create derivative works from, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any technology used to provide the site and service.\n</li>\n<li>use a robot or other automated means to monitor the activity on or copy information or pages from the site and service, except search engines, traffic counters, or similar basic performance monitoring technology.\n</li>\n<li>impersonate another person or entity.\n</li>\n<li>use any meta tags, search terms, keywords, or similar tags that contain Spreadshirt's name or trademarks.\n</li>\n<li>engage in any activity that interferes with another user's ability to use or enjoy the site and service, including activity that places a disproportionate burden on the site and service compared to ordinary use from a single, ordinary user;</li>\n<li>assist or encourage any third party in engaging in any activity prohibited by this agreement.\nor</li>\n<li>use the site and service to promote hate speech, obscenity, or any content that violates Spreadshirt's Ethical Guidelines, which Spreadshirt may change from time to time in Spreadshirt's sole discretion.</li>\n</ol> 3.\nShops <p> (a)\tTwo shop types are available on Spreadshirt's site.\nFirst, there are shops designed and operated by Spreadshirt itself (\"Spreadshirt Shop(s)\") and shops designed and operated by independent shop owners (\"Partner Shop(s)\").\nInformation about the owner of any shop is available as a linked page in each shop.<br>\n<br> (b)\tIndependent shop owners of Partner Shops are solely responsible for the products and designs offered in those shops, the design of those shops, and the advertising of the articles offered.\nSpreadshirt does not use designs or products of shop owners until a customer places an order that includes one of those designs or products.<br>\n<br>\n</p> 4.\nProduct Sales <p> (a)\tBy placing an order using Spreadshirt's site and service, a customer makes a binding offer for a contract of sale or, as the case may be, a contract for work and materials with Spreadshirt only (no contract exists between the customer and any applicable shop owner).\nSpreadshirt sends an order confirmation via e-mail to the customer.\nThe order confirmation is not an acceptance of the offer, but only acknowledges that the order was received.\nThe offer is only accepted when Spreadshirt confirms that production has completed in a second e-mail.\nSpreadshirt cannot guarantee the continued availability of any products or designs found on its site.<br>\n<br> (b)\tInformation, drawings, figures, technical data, specifications of weight, measurements and services contained in brochures, catalogues, newsletters, ads, or price lists are purely informational.\nSpreadshirt cannot guarantee the correctness of this information, and if there is any inconsistency between the information described above and the information in an order confirmation email, the order confirmation email controls.<br>\n<br> (c)\tSpreadshirt reserves the right to reject orders for any reason or no reason.\nIf Spreadshirt rejects an order, it will notify the customer.<br>\n<br> (d)\tSpreadshirt's performance of an order is completed when the shipment provider completes delivery to the customer's address, according to the records of the shipment provider.\nIf there is an interruption of delivery, and Spreadshirt cannot replace the order in a reasonable amount of time, Spreadshirt will notify the customer immediately.<br>\n<br> (e)\tIf there is a product defect or if you are dissatisfied with your order for any reason, Spreadshirt's return policy will apply, which Spreadshirt may change at any time in its sole discretion.\n</p> 5.\nDelivery &amp.\nShipment <p> (a)\tSpreadshirt warrants that it will ship orders within three weeks after orders are placed.\nNormally, goods are shipped within a few days and typical delivery times are 2-4 days, but in certain circumstances shipment and delivery can take up to three weeks.\nCustomers and Spreadshirt may separately agree to more specific delivery times and terms in a separate writing or agreement (such as a request for express shipping).\n<br>\n<br> (b)\tSpreadshirt will make delivery using a shipment service provider of its choosing.\nThe customer must pay standard shipping costs which may depend on order value and shipping destinations.\nShipping costs are displayed at checkout.\n</p> 6.\nPrices <p> (a)\tAll prices found on Spreadshirt's site are final, and may change from time to time.\nShipping and handling are billed and shown separately at checkout (or on invoices, if applicable).\nThe shipping address and order amount may affect certain costs, and sales taxes may apply to some orders.<br>\n<br> (b)\tFor customers ordering from outside the United States, all product prices are net of local taxes and fees.\nIf, according to applicable law, the goods are subject to sales taxes, import duties, import brokerage fees, or other taxes or fees in the recipient's country, then the customer has the sole responsibility to pay these taxes and fees.\n<br>\n<br> (c)\tCustomers must pay the purchase price, applicable sales taxes, and shipping and handling charges immediately upon placing an order, without deduction.\n</p> 7.\nPayment <p> (a)\tCustomers may choose to pay by direct debit, credit card, advance payment, or other payment methods.\nSpreadshirt reserves the right to limit the method of payment chosen by the customer depending on order value, shipment destination, or other objective criteria.<br>\n<br> (b)\tIf the customer selects a payment method or provides payment information that makes it impossible or impractical for Spreadshirt to receive payment (for example, the customer's account lacks sufficient funds, or the customer provided incorrect payment information) through no fault of Spreadshirt's own, the customer agrees that Spreadshirt may add an additional charge to the order to recoup costs associated with processing or attempting to process the impossible or impractical transaction.<br>\n<br> (c)\tSpreadshirt may sub-contract third parties to process payment.<br>\n<br> (d)\tIf the customer fails to pay, Spreadshirt may assign its claims to a debt collection agency and transfer the personal data required for collecting payment to these third parties.\n</p> 8.\nTitle to Products <p> Until Spreadshirt receives full payment for an order and the order is shipped, title to the goods remains with Spreadshirt.\nUpon transfer of the goods to the carrier, title and risk of loss passes to the customer.\nThe customer should handle products with care until the transfer of ownership is complete (for example, in case of a product return).\n</p> 9.\nDisclaimers <p> (a)\tSpreadshirt provides the site and service on an \"as is\" and \"as available\" basis.\nSpreadshirt does not represent or warrant that the site and service or its use: (i) will be uninterrupted, timely, safe, or secure, (ii) will be free of inaccuracies, errors, or vulnerabilities, (iii) will meet your expectations or requirements, or (iv) will operate in the configuration or with the hardware or software you use.\nSpreadshirt hereby disclaims any and all

of the site and service, including all content, data or software distributed by, downloaded, or accessed from or through the site and service, is at your sole risk.\nYou understand and agree that you will be solely responsible for any damage to your business or your computer system or any loss of data that results from your actions and your use of the site and service.\nSpreadshirt does not control or endorse in any respect any information, products, or services offered by third parties through the site and service, and is not responsible for any possible representations and warranties these third parties may make.<br>\n<br> (c)\tDue to normal changes in our industry and in our technical production processes, Spreadshirt may reasonably deviate from the descriptions and information found in its brochures, catalogues, and other documents with respect to material, color, weight, measurements, design, or other features.<br>\n<br> (d)\tSpreadshirt may use subcontractors or third parties to provide certain elements of its site and service.\nYou agree that Spreadshirt will not be liable to you in any way for your use of these services.\n</p> 10.\nLimitation of Liability <p> (a)\tYou use Spreadshirt's site and service at your own risk.\nSpreadshirt provides its site and service without any express or implied warranties (See Section 9(a) (Disclaimers) above).\nSpreadshirt is not responsible for the actions, content, information, or data of third parties.\nYou release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against Spreadshirt or any related third parties.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code \u00a71542, which says in full: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\" <br>\n<br> (b)\tSpreadshirt is not liable to you for any lost profits or other consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damages arising out of or relating to the site and service or any agreement between you and Spreadshirt, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\nSpreadshirt's aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with the site and service or any agreement between you and Spreadshirt may not exceed the lesser $100 or the amount of cash actually exchanged between you and Spreadshirt within the past six months.\nApplicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability described in this Section.\nIn such cases, Spreadshirt's liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.\n</p> 11.\nUser Representations and Warranties.\nSpreadshirt's Right to Refuse Performance <p> (a)\tIf you upload designs or make changes to products in any way (for example, adding custom text), you represent and warrant to Spreadshirt that you have all necessary rights (for example, in trademark, copyright, privacy rights, publicity rights, common law, etc.) to use the text or design without violating the rights of any third party.\nSpreadshirt may, in its sole discretion, refuse to print any designs or text that you submit.\nHowever, Spreadshirt is not obligated to review any of your submissions.\n<br>\n<br> (b)\tYou agree to (i) indemnify and (ii) release Spreadshirt from all liability (including costs and attorney's fees) for claims relating to the alleged or actual infringement of any third-party rights and any law to the extent that such claims relate to your use of Spreadshirt's site and service.\nIf you are a shop owner with Spreadshirt, Spreadshirt may offset amounts in your shop owner account to satisfy the indemnification payments owed according to this paragraph.\n</p> 12.\nData Protection <p> Spreadshirt collects and uses your information according to its privacy policy.\nYou acknowledge that you are responsible for the securing your own information (including passwords), keeping your sensitive information confidential, and taking

incorporating this agreement by reference) must be construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and Massachusetts without regard to their choice of law rules.\nThe parties agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to this agreement must be submitted to confidential binding arbitration in Boston, Massachusetts, except that Spreadshirt may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in Massachusetts if you have violated or threatened to violate the intellectual property rights of Spreadshirt or a third party, or any term of any agreement you have with Spreadshirt.\nThe parties agree that </p>\n<ol>\n<li> the arbitration will be provided by an alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties, and if the parties cannot agree, then through the American Arbitration Association.\n</li>\n<li> claims must be conducted on an individual basis, and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.\nand </li>\n<li>any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator is final, binding, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> (b)\tIf any action or claim is filed in contravention of the arbitration rules provided in paragraph 13(a), the parties agree to personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts of Massachusetts, Suffolk County, and both waive the right to a jury trial.\nAll claims filed or brought contrary to paragraph 13(a) are improperly filed, and the non-filing party is entitled to recover all attorneys fees and costs relating to dismissal of the improperly filed claim incurred after the non-filing party has given notice in writing of the improperly filed claim.&nbsp.\n</p> 14.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act <p> Spreadshirt will respond to legitimate requests under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (<strong>\"DMCA\"</strong>), and retains the right to deny service to any user if in Spreadshirt's sole discretion, the usage or content poses a risk of allegations of infringement of the copyright (or other intellectual property right) of others.\nIf you become aware of user content on Spreadshirt's site and service that infringes your copyright rights, you may submit a properly formatted DMCA request (see 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512) to Spreadshirt's DMCA agent according the instructions found at the link

and without notice, for any reason or no reason, but especially if Spreadshirt believes that you (or any others whom Spreadshirt believes that you act in concert with) have violated or will violate any laws, rights, or term (or the spirit of any term) of any agreement you are a party to with Spreadshirt, its affiliates, contractual partners, or users.\nor if Spreadshirt believes in its sole discretion that your use of the site and service may create any risk (including any legal risk) for Spreadshirt, its affiliates, contractual partners, or users.\nLimitation of access may include removal or modification of content that you have uploaded or otherwise sent to or through the site and service.\n<br>\n<br> (b)\tIf Spreadshirt exercises its rights under Section 15(a), or if you delete your account, this entire agreement and any other agreements you have entered into with Spreadshirt will survive indefinitely until otherwise terminated according to their terms, if applicable.\n</p> 16.\nMiscellaneous <p> (a)\t<u>Entire Agreement.</u> This agreement (along with other policies found on Spreadshirt's site and service) contains the entire agreement between the parties and replaces all prior oral and written agreements.\nNo oral modifications, express or implied, may change the terms of this agreement.\nThe parties have not relied on any representations or promises relating to the subject matter of this agreement except those contained within the four corners of this agreement.<br>\n<br> (b)\t<u>Relationship of Parties.</u> This agreement and other agreements relating to the site and service do not constitute a joint venture, partnership, agency, employment or fiduciary relationship between the parties, except when one is expressly

effect.\nIf any provision is held invalid or unenforceable with respect to particular circumstances, it will remain in full force and effect in all other circumstances.<br>\n<br> (f)\t<u>Waivers.</u> Waivers are only effective when in writing.\nIf Spreadshirt waives enforcement of a breach of any term of this agreement, later breaches of the same or other terms are not waived.\nAccepting late performance of any act or late fulfillment of any condition of this agreement is not a waiver of the act or condition itself.<br>\n<br> (g)\t<u>Interpretation Rules.</u> \"Or\" when used in a group of phrases or nouns intends to include any combination of all or any of the items in the group, and not merely one member or the other of such a group.\nWhen \"includes\" or \"including\" begins a list of items, the list is not exclusive.\nAll headings used in this agreement are for convenience only, and are not to be taken into account when interpreting the meaning of any term of this agreement.<br>\n<br> (h)\t<u>Conflicts.</u> If there are any conflicts between this agreement and another agreement between you and Spreadshirt, then the terms of that other agreement will control

for the processing is our legitimate interests.\n</p> b) Cookies and similar technologies <p> We also use \u201ccookies\u201d on our sites.\nCookies are small text files that are assigned to your browser and stored on your device.\nThrough them, certain information flows to the place that sets the cookie, such as settings or data for exchange with the system.\nThis helps us to make our website more user-friendly and effective overall.\nThe legal bases for this are your consent and our legitimate interests.\nCookies cannot execute programs or transmit viruses to your device.\n</p>\n<p> We use session cookies, persistent cookies, and third-party cookies.\n</p>\n<p> Session cookies&nbsp;store what\u2019s called a session ID, which can be used to assign different requests of your browser to a common session.\nThis allows your device to be recognized when you return to our website.\nFor example, this lets you store certain information you have entered (such as log-in information, language settings) in such a way that you do not have to repeat it constantly.\nSession cookies are automatically deleted when you log out or close your browser.\n</p>\n<p> Persistent cookies&nbsp;remain on your device for the time being, so that we can recognize your browser on your next visit and we can, for example, assign your preferred information and settings.\nLong-term

cookies&nbsp;on your device.\nThe cookies contain information about how our website is used, e.g.\nwhich pages and products were visited.\nThe data is collected in a pseudonymized form by assigning an

Account <p> a) If you want to order something in our online shop, it is necessary for the conclusion of the contract that you give us the personal data we need to process the order.\nThe mandatory data required to process the contract is marked as such.\nall other data you provide is voluntary.\nYou can either enter your data only once for the order or use your email address to set up a password-protected user account with us, in which your data can be stored for later purchases until you revoke your consent.\nYou can deactivate or delete the data and the user account at any time via the account.\n</p>\n<p> To prevent unauthorized access to your personal data by third parties, the order process is encrypted using TLS technology.\n</p>\n<p> When we process the data provided by you to process your order, this includes, for example, individual customer service.\nIn the course of order processing, we pass on personal data to one of our production companies within the group, to a shipping company commissioned by us and (with the exception of PayPal) to our bank, ADYEN B.V., Simon Carmiggeltstraat 6-50, 1011 DJ Amsterdam, Netherlands (\u201cAdyen\u201d).\nThe payment data is encrypted and transmitted directly to Adyen.\n</p>\n<p> Payment via PayPal is processed by PayPal, 2211 North First Street San Jose, California 95131 (\u201cPayPal\u201d).\nFor information about data protection at PayPal, please refer to PayPal\u2019s privacy policy:&nbsp;https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.\n</p>\n<p> In the case of trackable parcels, we also pass on your order and address data to parcelLab GmbH, Landwehrstra\u00dfe 39, 80336 Munich, Germany, to make it possible to track your parcel and to inform you about delivery deviations or delays, for example.\nWe also

of personal data as part of order processing are to perform under a contract and our legitimate interests.\nDue to commercial and tax regulations, we are obliged to store your order, address and payment data for a period of ten years.\n</p>\n<p> b) During the order process we also conduct a fraud prevention check via our bank Adyen, which involves using your IP address to carry out a geo-localization and compare your data with previous experience.\nThis may mean that an order cannot be placed with the selected payment method.\nOur aim in this regard is to prevent any abuse of your chosen payment method by third parties and to protect ourselves from payment defaults.\nThe legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> Since this involves automated decision-making, you have the right to challenge the decision (in this case the refusal of a certain payment method) and have the decision reviewed by a person.\nIn such cases we ask that you contact us using the contact details mentioned in Section 1.\nPlease note that the payment method may have been rejected due to a typing error and you should, therefore, check what you have entered again during the order process if necessary.\n</p>\n<p> c) During the ordering process we use Google Maps Autocomplete, a service of Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d).\nThis allows an address you start typing to be completed automatically, avoiding delivery errors.\nGoogle sometimes conducts a geo-localization using your IP address and receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding subpage of our website.\nIn addition, the data referred to in Section 2.1 is transmitted.\nThis is regardless of whether you have a Google account and are logged in.\nOnce you are logged in to your Google Account, the information will be directly associated with your account.\nIf you do not want this assignment to occur, you must log out before entering your address.\nGoogle stores your data as user profiles and uses it (even in the case of users who are not logged in) for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-oriented design of its own website.\nYou can object to Google creating such user profiles.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data processing by Google and about protecting your privacy, please refer to Google\u2019s Privacy Policy:&nbsp;https://policies.google.com/privacy.\nThe binding terms of use for Google Maps/Google Earth can be found here:&nbsp;https://www.google.com/help/terms_maps.html.\nThird-party provider information: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.\n</p>\n<p> The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> d) After you place an order, we will process your order and address data to send you a personalized email asking you to rate our products.\nBy obtaining ratings, our aim is to improve our services and adapt them to our customers\u2019 wishes.\nWe use the feedback software of eKomi Ltd, Markgrafenstra\u00dfe 11, 10969 Berlin, Germany (\u201ceKomi\u201d).\nFor the purpose of sending the feedback email (and in the event that a moderation or conciliation procedure is conducted via eKomi following negative feedback), we pass on your email address, name, order number, product types and a unique ID to eKomi for identification purposes and in order to generate a feedback link.\n</p>\n<p> The legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.\nIf you no longer want your data to be used for this purpose, you can object to this at any time.\nJust click on the unsubscribe link included with each email or send a message using the contact details provided under Section 1.\n</p>\n<p> e) We also use Google Customer Reviews, a service of Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d), through which we receive feedback about us as a seller and about our products.\nThis allows us to improve our services and adapt them to our customers\u2019 wishes.\nThe legal basis is our legitimate interests.\nAfter placing an order, you can give Google permission to use your email address to request a review.\nYou can

to offer designs on our marketplace or operate a shop, it is necessary for the conclusion of a contract with us that you use your email address to open a password-protected user account and store your name and address there.\nFor the payout of earnings, it is necessary that you additionally provide your bank details or your PayPal information as well as information about your tax status.\nAny other information you may provide to us when using the account is voluntary.\nYou do not have to enter a real name when choosing your username.\nYou can manage and change this information in your account.\nYou can also deactivate or erase it \u2013 or the entire user account.\nIf this affects data necessary for the performance of the contract, we may retain that data for a longer period in accordance with commercial and tax regulations (standard period of ten years).\nWe process this data to conduct the contractual relationship that exists with you.\nthe legal bases are to perform under a contract and our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> b) Within the scope of the contractual relationship, we also process the email address provided by you in order to send you emails at irregular intervals containing information and tips about the Marketplace and your shops (\u201cPartner Newsletter\u201d).\nWe use your name to allow us to personalize these emails.\nTo this end, the data is passed on to the software company Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG, Hans-Fischer-Stra\u00dfe 10, 80339 Munich, Germany (\u201cEmarsys\u201d), which handles the technical side of the mailing on our behalf.\nYou can unsubscribe from the Partner Newsletter at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email, informing us via the contact details specified in Section 1, or changing your newsletter settings in your user account (\u201cAccount Settings\u201d \u2013 \u201cNewsletter subscriptions\u201d).\n</p>\n<p> When sending the Partner Newsletter, we use Emarsys to statistically evaluate your user behavior in order to optimize the design.\nTo enable this evaluation, the emails contain what are called web beacons or tracking pixels.\nThese are single-pixel image files that establish a connection to our website und thus permit a log file analysis.\nThe web beacons are linked with the data mentioned in Section 2.1 a and an individual ID.\nThe links contained in the email also contain this ID.\nFor example, we can see if and when an email has been opened and which links have been clicked on.\nThe data is stored on the Emarsys servers for 13 months and collected pseudonymously, meaning the IDs are not linked to other personal data at this point, thus ruling out any possibility of direct personal reference.\nYou can object to the recording of your usage behavior at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email, informing us via the contact options listed in Section 1, or changing the newsletter settings in your user account (\u201cAccount settings\u201d \u2013 \u201cNewsletter subscriptions\u201d).\nRecording is not possible if you have disabled the display of images in your email settings.\nIn this case, the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.\nIf you choose to display the images manually, recording will take place as described above.\n</p>\n<p> The legal bases for the processing are your consent, to perform under a contract, and our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> c) If you store your address in your user account, we use Google Maps Autocomplete, a service of Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d).\nThis allows an address you start typing to be completed automatically.\nThis helps us verify your address, which we do for tax reasons.\nGoogle sometimes conducts a geo-localization using your IP address.\nWe also use Google Fonts to enhance the user experience in the Partner section of your account as well as Google Calendar to inform you about Partner-related promotions for customers.\nVia these services and applications, Google receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding subpage of our website.\nIn addition, the data referred to in Section 2.1 is transmitted.\nThis is regardless of whether you have a Google account and are logged in.\nOnce you are logged in to your Google Account, the information will be directly associated with your account.\nIf you do not want this assignment to occur, you must log out before entering your address.\nGoogle stores your data as user profiles and uses it (even in the case of users who are not logged in) for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-oriented design of its own website.\nYou can object to Google creating such user profiles.\nFor more detailed information about the purpose and scope of data processing by Google and about protecting your privacy, please refer to Google\u2019s Privacy

data.\nThe name and contact details of our partners are stored in the legal information section of the respective shop.\n</p> 2.6 Advertising activities by Spreadshirt a) Newsletter <p> If you register separately for our newsletter via our website and give us your consent, we will use your email address to send you regular emails about product offers, discounts and contests.\nTo this end, we pass the data on to the software company Emarsys eMarketing Systems AG, Hans-Fischer-Stra\u00dfe 10, 80339 Munich, Germany (\u201cEmarsys\u201d), which handles the technical side of the mailing on our behalf.\n</p>\n<p> When you register for our newsletter, we use the so-called double opt-in procedure.\nThis means that after you register we will send you an email to the email address you provided, in which we ask you to confirm that you would like to receive the newsletter.\nIf you do not confirm your registration, your information will be automatically deleted after one month.\nOn the other hand, if you confirm the newsletter subscription, we will save your email address for the purpose of sending you the newsletter until you unsubscribe from the newsletter.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can revoke your consent to the sending of the newsletter at any time (without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing up to the point of revocation).\nYou can declare your revocation by clicking on the link provided in every newsletter email, by emailing&nbsp;info@spreadshirt.com&nbsp;or by sending a message to the contact details provided in Section 1.</strong>\n</p>\n<p> When sending the newsletter, we use Emarsys to statistically evaluate your user behavior in order to measure how successful the newsletter is and to optimize its design.\nTo enable this evaluation, the emails contain what are called web beacons or tracking pixels.\nThese are single-pixel image files that establish a connection to our website und thus permit a log file analysis.\nThe web beacons are linked with the data mentioned in Section 2.1 a and an individual ID.\nThe links contained in the newsletter also contain this ID.\nFor example, we can see if and when an email has been opened and which links have been clicked on.\nThe data is stored on the Emarsys servers for 13 months and collected pseudonymously, meaning the IDs are not linked to other personal data at this point, thus ruling out any possibility of direct personal reference.\nYou can object to the recording of your usage behavior at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link provided in each email or by informing us using the contact details provided in Section 1.\nRecording is not possible if you have disabled the display of images in your email settings.\nIn this case, the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.\nIf you choose to display the images manually, recording will take place as described above.\n</p>\n<p> The legal bases for the processing are your consent and our legitimate interests.\n</p> b) Product recommendations <p> As a Spreadshirt customer, i.e., if you order something in our online shop (see Section 2.2 a), we process the email address you provide in order to send you regular email recommendations for products that might be of interest to you based on your previous orders from us.\nWe also use your name to allow us to personalize these emails.\nThe data is passed on to the software company Emarsys (see Section 2.6 a), which handles the technical side of the mailing on our behalf.\nThe legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> You receive these product recommendations because you did not object to the use of your email address for this purpose by removing the corresponding check mark during the order process.\nIf you subsequently no longer wish to receive product recommendations or any advertising messages, you can object at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs at the basic rates.\nJust click on the unsubscribe link included with each email, send a message using the contact details provided under Section 1 or \u2013 if you have a user account with us \u2013 adjust your newsletter settings accordingly (\u201cAccount settings\u201d - \u201cNewsletter subscriptions\u201d).\n</p>\n<p> When

settings in your user account (\u201cAccount settings\u201d \u2013 \u201cNewsletter subscriptions\u201d).\nRecording is not possible if you have disabled the display of images in your email settings.\nIn this case, the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full and you may not be able to use all functions.\nIf you choose to display the images manually, recording will take place as described above.\n</p> c) Newsletters and product recommendations from Spreadshirt Shop Partners <p> In exceptional cases where you register separately in a Spreadshirt shop for a Shop Partner\u2019s newsletter and thus give your consent, we transmit your email address to the Shop Partner so that it can send you emails on product offers, discounts and contests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can revoke your consent to the sending of the newsletter at any time (without this affecting the lawfulness of the processing up to the point of revocation).\nThis revocation must be declared vis-\u00e0-vis the Shop Partner.\nThe contact details of the respective Shop Partner can be found in the legal information section of their Spreadshirt shop.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for the processing is your consent.</p> d) Postal Advertisements <p> We would like to occasionally inform you about new products, deals, and contests and may use your name and address to send you postal mail.\nIn this case we share your name and address our selected shipping or mailing provider.\nThe legal basis for the processing is our legitimate interests.\nYou may object to the use of your personal information for this purposes anytime by notifying us at the contact information provided in Section 1.\n</p> 2.7 Usage-based online advertising <p> Our website uses various conversion tracking and retargeting technologies made available by other service providers.\nWe use these technologies to make our website interesting for you.\nThe information also helps us to address users who have already shown an interest in our products with individually tailored advertising on the websites of our partner companies.\nWe assume that the display of personalized, interest-based advertising is generally more interesting for the internet user than advertising that has no such personal relevance.\nAt the same time, we want to avoid inappropriate and intrusive advertising.\n</p>\n<p> General information about third-party advertising-based technologies and how to disable them can be found on the following websites, among others: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Your Online Choices:&nbsp;http://www.youronlinechoices.com/ </li>\n<li> YourAdChoices:&nbsp;http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/ </li>\n<li> Network Advertising Initiative:&nbsp;http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/ </li>\n</ul> a) Use of Google Ads conversion tracking and Google Ads remarketing <p> We use Google Ads, a service of Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d), to use ads to draw attention to our offers on external websites.\nIn relation to the data of advertising campaigns, we can identify how successful the individual advertising activities are.\nIn this way we want to show you advertising that is of interest to you, make our website more attractive to you and achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.\n</p>\n<p> These ads are deployed by Google via \u2018ad servers\u2019.\nFor this purpose, we use ad server cookies, which enable the tracking of certain parameters for measuring success, such as the display of ads or clicks by users.\nIf you arrive at our website via a Google ad, Google Ads will store a cookie on your device.\nThese cookies usually expire after 30 days and are not intended to identify you personally.\nAnalysis values usually stored for this cookie are the unique cookie ID, the number of ad impressions per placement (frequency), the last impression (relevant for post-view conversions) and opt-out information (marker showing that the user no longer wishes to be targeted).\n</p>\n<p> These cookies allow Google to recognize your internet browser.\nIf a user visits certain pages of a Google Ads customer\u2019s website (in this case ours) and the cookie stored on their device has not yet expired, Google and the customer can recognize that the user has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this site.\nEach Google Ads customer is assigned a different cookie.\nCookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of Google Ads customers.\nWe do not collect and process any personal data in the aforementioned advertising activities.\nGoogle merely provides us with statistical evaluations.\nOn the basis of these evaluations we can identify which of the advertising activities used are particularly effective.\nWe do not receive any further data from the use of ads.\nin particular we cannot identify users on the basis of this information.\n</p>\n<p> Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server.\nWe have no influence on the extent and further processing of the data collected by Google through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to what we know: By integrating Google Ads Conversion, Google receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding part of our website, or that you have clicked on one of our ads.\nIf you are registered with a Google service, Google can associate the visit with your account.\nEven if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible that Google will obtain and store your IP address.\n</p>\n<p>- Google Ads remarketing</p>\n<p> Besides Google Ads Conversion, we also use Google\u2019s remarketing feature.\nThis is a process we use in an attempt to contact you again.\nAfter visiting our website, this feature makes it possible to show you our ads when you continue to use the internet.\nThis is done by means of cookies stored in your browser, which Google uses to record and evaluate your usage behavior when visiting various websites.\nThis is how Google can determine that you have previously visited our website.\nAccording to its own information, Google does not combine the data collected in the context of remarketing with your personal data, which may be processed by Google.\nSpecifically, according to Google, pseudonymization is used during remarketing.\n</p>\n<p> There are various ways in which you can prevent your participation in this tracking procedure: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> By setting your browser software accordingly.\nin particular, disabling cookies from third party providers means that you will not receive any ads from third-party providers.\n</li>\n<li> By permanent deactivation in your browser Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome via the link:&nbsp;https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996?hl=en.\nPlease note that by doing this you may not be able to properly use the full functionality of our website.\n</li>\n<li> By clicking on the following button:&nbsp;Disable Enable Google Ads.\nThis will place an opt-out cookie which prevents recording when you visit our website in future.\nPlease note that if you delete all cookies on your device, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted.\nin this case, if you still wish to object then you must place the cookie again using the above button.\nThe opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this

Initiative (NAI) at:&nbsp;http://www.networkadvertising.org.\n</p> b) Use of Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Website Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion Tracking <p>- Facebook Custom Audiences</p>\n<p> Our website also uses the Website Custom Audiences remarketing function of Facebook, Inc.\n(\u201cFacebook\u201d).\nThis allows users of the website to see interest-based ads (\u201cFacebook Ads\u201d) when visiting the social network Facebook or other websites that also use the process.\nOur intention here is to show you ads that are of interest to you.\n</p>\n<p> Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Facebook server.\nWe have no influence on the extent and further processing of the data collected by Facebook through the use of this tool and therefore inform you according to what we know: By integrating Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook receives the information that you have retrieved the corresponding part of our website, or that you have clicked on one of our ads.\nIf you are registered with a Facebook service, Facebook can associate the visit with your account.\nEven if you are not registered with Facebook or have not logged in, it is possible that Facebook will obtain and store your IP address and other identifying information.\n</p>\n<p>- Facebook Website Custom Audiences</p>\n<p> Our website also uses the Facebook product \u201cCustom Audiences from your website\u201d.\nFor this purpose, we have integrated remarketing tags (so-called Facebook Pixel or web beacon) into our website.\nThe Facebook Pixel is a small piece of JavaScript code that provides a range of functionalities for sending application-specific events and user-defined data to Facebook.\nWe use the Facebook Pixel to track how visitors use our site.\nThe Facebook Pixel records and reports to Facebook information about the user\u2019s browser session, a hashed version of the Facebook ID, and the URL being viewed.\nEvery Facebook user therefore has a device-independent Facebook ID, which enables us to recognize users across multiple devices on the social network Facebook so that we can use Facebook Ads to reach our visitors again for advertising purposes.\nAfter 180 days, the user information is deleted until the user returns to our website.\nNo personal information is transmitted to us about individual website visitors, and we can only specifically deploy ads to website custom audiences if the custom audience has reached a critical size.\nThis makes it impossible for us to determine the individual identities of visitors.\n</p>\n<p>- Facebook Conversion Tracking</p>\n<p> We also use the Facebook Pixel on our website to measure the reach of ads.\nThis allows us to track users\u2019 actions after they have seen or clicked on a Facebook Ad.\nThe Facebook Pixel records and reports to Facebook information about the user\u2019s browser session, a hashed version of the Facebook ID, and the URL being viewed.\nThe way it works is comparable to Facebook Website Custom Audiences via the Facebook Pixel, which is already described above.\nUsing the hashed Facebook ID, we can measure the reach and effectiveness of an ad to find out whether you are actually interested in our advertising.\nThis enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook Ads for statistical and market research purposes.\nFor us, the data used is not personally identifiable.\n</p>\n<p> You can prevent Facebook from recording your data on this website by clicking here:&nbsp;Disable Enable Facebook Custom Audiences, Facebook Website Custom Audiences and Facebook Conversion Tracking.\nThis will place an opt-out cookie which prevents recording when you visit our website in future.\nPlease note that if you delete all cookies on your device, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted.\nin this case, if you still wish to object then you must place the cookie again using the above button.\nThe opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this website.\nHow to prevent the recording of your data on other websites is explained on the respective sites, and if you are a user who has logged in to Facebook, here:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_.\n</p>\n<p> The legal bases for the processing of data when using the functions specified above are your consent and our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> Third-party provider information: Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA

tracking and retargeting <p>- LinkedIn conversion tracking</p>\n<p> Our website uses the feature \u201cLinkedIn conversion tracking\u201d from LinkedIn Corporation (\u201cLinkedIn\u201d) to measure the reach of ads.\nThis is to determine how successful individual advertising activities are on LinkedIn.\nOur intention here is to develop and display advertising that is of interest to you and make our website more attractive.\nFor this purpose, the LinkedIn Insight Tag is integrated into our website.\nThis JavaScript code enables LinkedIn to use cookies to collect pseudonymous data about your visit and the use of our website (e.g.\nabout the browser session and the website displayed) and to provide us with aggregated, non-personal statistics on this basis.\nThis allows us to trace the actions that have taken place after a LinkedIn ad has been viewed or clicked on.\n</p>\n<p>- LinkedIn website retargeting</p>\n<p> Our website also uses the \u201cLinkedIn website retargeting\u201d feature.\nAfter visiting our website, this feature makes it possible to show you our ads when you continue to use the internet.\nOur intention here is to show you ads that are of interest to you.\nThis is done by means of a cookie stored in your browser (see above for more information), which is used to record and evaluate your usage behavior.\nNo personal information is transmitted to us about individual website visitors, and we can only specifically deploy ads to website custom audiences if the custom audience has reached a critical size.\nThis makes it impossible for us to determine the individual identities of visitors.\n</p>\n<p> There are various ways in which you can disable this tracking.\nYou can adjust your browser settings to prevent the storage of cookies, although this may result in a restriction of the functionality of our website for you.\nYou also can prevent LinkedIn from recording your data on this website by clicking here:&nbsp;Disable Enable LinkedIn conversion tracking and website retargeting.\nThis will place an opt-out cookie which prevents recording when you visit our website in future.\nPlease note that if you delete all cookies on your device, this opt-out cookie will also be deleted.\nin this case, if you still wish to object then you must place the cookie again using the above button.\nThe opt-out cookie is set per top-level domain, per browser and per device and only prevents the recording of data for this website.\nIn addition, you can disable interest-based ads from providers who are part of the \u201cYourAdChoices\u201d self-regulation initiative (http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/) or e.g.\npart of the Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/).\nplease

Conversion Tracking and remarketing <p>- Bing Ads Conversion Tracking</p>\n<p> Our website also uses the \u201cBing Ads Conversion Tracking\u201d feature from Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\") to measure the reach of ads.\nThis is to determine how successful our individual advertising activities are on Bing and Yahoo.\nOur intention here is to develop and display advertising that is of interest to you and make our website more attractive.\nFor this purpose, Microsoft\u2019s UET tag (Universal Event Tracking tag) is integrated into our website.\nThis JavaScript code enables Microsoft to use cookies to collect pseudonymous data about your visit and the use of our website (e.g.\nabout the browser session and the website displayed) and to provide us with aggregated, non-personal statistics on this basis (e.g.\nhow many visitors have reached a particular target page).\nThis allows us to trace the actions that have taken place after an ad has been viewed or clicked on Bing or Yahoo.\n</p>\n<p>- Bing Ads remarketing</p>\n<p> Our online offering also uses the \u201cBing Ads remarketing\u201d feature.\nAfter visiting our website, this feature allows us to show you our ads when you continue to use the internet.\nOur intention here is to show you ads that are of interest to you.\nThis is done by means of a cookie stored in your browser (see above for more information), which is used to record and evaluate your usage behavior.\nNo personal information is transmitted to us about individual website visitors, and we can only specifically deploy ads to website custom audiences if the custom audience has reached a critical size.\nThis makes it impossible for us to determine the individual identities of visitors.\n</p>\n<p> There are various ways in which you can

provided by ad pepper media GmbH (\u201cWebgains\u201d).\nThis enables us to measure the success of our ads on partner sites brokered for us by Webgains.\nIn this way we want to show you advertising that is of interest to you, make our website more attractive to you and achieve a fair calculation of advertising costs.\nFor this purpose, a tracking code is integrated into our site.\nThis code

partner of ours, we will provide you with a mobile app (hereinafter referred to as \"SpreadApp\") in addition to our online service that you can use to get an overview of your partner statistics (credits, sales and bestsellers) at any time.\n</p> a) Processing of personal data when using our SpreadApp <p>- Log-in</p>\n<p> In order to connect your mobile device to your Spreadshirt user account via the SpreadApp, it is either necessary for you to use your smartphone camera to scan the QR code displayed or to enter your Spreadshirt user name or e-mail address and password in the input screen provided.\nThe legal basis for processing the data is to perform under a contract.\n</p>\n<p>- App permissions and notifications</p>\n<p> If you allow this on your mobile device, SpreadApp has the authorization to access your camera.\nThis enables you to connect your mobile device to your user account by scanning a QR code.\nIf you allow this on your mobile device, you will also receive notifications from SpreadApp (e.g.\nabout new sales).\nYou can manage these types of access at any time on your mobile device in the system settings.\nSpreadApp can also be used without the functions.\nThe legal basis for the processing is your consent.\n</p>\n<p>- Display of information from the Spreadshirt user account</p>\n<p> The SpreadApp reads out and displays the following information from your user account: Your username, the user account number, your credit balance, an overview of your sales and your bestselling products and designs.\nThis is necessary for the implementation of the amended contract that exists with you as our partner.\nThe legal basis for the processing is to perform under a contract.\n</p>\n<p>- Log files</p>\n<p> When using the SpreadApp, we also process personal data mentioned below.\nThese are technically necessary for us to enable you to use the functions of the app comfortably and to guarantee stability and security (legal bases are to perform under a contract and our legitimate interests): </p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP address,</li>\n<li>date and time of the request,</li>\n<li>content of the request (concrete page),</li>\n<li>page from which the request comes,</li>\n<li>access status/HTTP status code,</li>\n<li>the amount of data transferred in each case,</li>\n<li>browser,</li>\n<li>language and version of the browser software,</li>\n<li>operating system and its interface,</li>\n<li>device identification,</li>\n<li>type and name of your mobile device,</li>\n<li>screen size and resolution,</li>\n<li>country and city,</li>\n<li>version of the app,</li>\n<li>number of your Spreadshirt user account.</li>\n</ul> b) Processing of Personal Information for Application Analysis <p> In addition to processing the aforementioned data, a technology comparable to cookies is used for your use of SpreadApp.\nBy the use of JavaScript code, counting impulses are transmitted to counting servers of the service providers listed below.\nThis information enables us to analyze how you use our SpreadApp.\nYou can prevent this usage information from being collected by deactivating the \"I'm in\" button when you install the SpreadApp or by deactivating the \"App analysis\" button in the \"Settings\" section of your SpreadApp later on.\n</p>\n<p>- Google Analytics</p>\n<p> The SpreadApp uses Google Analytics, an analysis service of Google LLC (\"Google\").\nThe information generated by the JavaScript code about your usage is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there for 26 months.\nDue to the activation of IP anonymization in the SpreadApp, your IP address will be shortened by Google.\nOn our behalf, Google will use this information to evaluate how you use the SpreadApp in order to compile reports on app activity and to provide us with other services relating to the app use.\nThe IP address transmitted by your browser in the context of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google.\nSpreadApp uses Google Analytics with the extension \"_anonymizeIp()\".\nThis means that IP addresses are shortened for further processing, so that it is not possible to identify individuals.\nIf the data collected about you is related to your person, it is excluded immediately, and the personal data is deleted immediately.\nWe use Google Analytics to analyze and improve the use of SpreadApp on a regular basis.\nThe statistics obtained enable us to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user.\nThe legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is our legitimate interests.\n</p>\n<p> Third-party information: Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.\nSee also the terms of use

data, you can revoke this consent with future effect at any time.\nThis does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out on the basis of the consent before you revoke your consent.\n</p>\n<p> If we base the processing of your personal data on our legitimate interests, you are entitled to object to the processing.\nThis is the case if the processing is not necessary in particular for the performance of a contract with you, which was described by us in each case with the description of the individual functions.\nWhen exercising such a right of objection, we ask that you explain the reasons why we should not process your personal data as carried out by us.\nIn the event that your objection is justified, we will examine the situation and either stop or adjust the data processing or point out to you the compelling legitimate reasons on the basis of which we will continue processing.\n</p>\n<p> However, you can of course object to the processing of your personal data for advertising or web analytics purposes at any time without giving reasons.\n</p>\n<p> As described in the relevant sections, we sometimes use external service providers to process your data.\nThese have been carefully selected and commissioned by us, are bound by our instructions and are regularly checked.\n</p>\n<p> The personal data processed by us is generally erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply.\nData may be stored for a longer period if this has been provided for by laws or other rules to which we as the controller are subject.\nThe data will also be blocked or erased once a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.\n</p>\n<p> Further processing operations may be required for contests and other promotional campaigns.\nIn such cases we will inform you in the context of the respective promotional campaign.\n</p> 4.\nWe Will Share Your Information with Third Parties in Specific Circumstances a) Legal Compliance and Safety <p> We will share your information with third parties in specific circumstances.\nIf we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a similar event, we may transfer your information as part of that transaction.\nIn addition, there are a few times when we must share your information either to protect our rights, to further our legitimate interests, or to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject.\nWe will share your personal information when we believe in good faith that: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> a subpoena or warrant is duly issued, or we receive any other legitimate government agency request to produce information.\n</li>\n<li> we need to share the information in order to enforce or protect our own rights, for example, to respond to and resolve third-party claims or complaints, or with respect to contracts with our users and third parties.\n</li>\n<li> we need to address a security or technical issue within our website.\n</li>\n<li> sharing the information is necessary to prevent harm to others or others\u2019 property, especially in an emergency situation.\n</li>\n</ul> b) Corporate Change in Control Events <p> If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a similar event, we may transfer your information as part of that transaction.\n</p> 5.\nIs My Information Secure? <p> We use reasonable measures to secure our website and any private information you submit to us against loss, tampering, unauthorized access, and other malicious acts.\nFor example, we use SSL connections when possible to protect your data while it is in transit (for example login data and customer orders).\nHowever, no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, so we cannot completely guarantee the security of any data.\nYou use our services at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your password, information, and account.\n</p> 6.\nDo-Not-Track (\u201cDNT\u201d)
