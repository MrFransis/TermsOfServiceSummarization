Inc.\n(\"we,\" \"our,\" \"us\" or \"CS\") or a third party agent of CS, and other websites, apps, and services where this Privacy Policy is posted (collectively, the \"Sites\").</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BECAUSE BY USING THE SITES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR PRIVACY PRACTICES.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITES.</p>\n<p>Your use of the Sites is also expressly subject to our Terms of Use, available at https://curiositystream.com/terms/.</p>\n<p>Those with disabilities may also access this Privacy Policy in an alternative text-based format, such as HTML, RTF, or PDF by clicking here.</p>\n<p>Please note the arbitration provision set forth below, which may, except where and to the extent prohibited by law, require you to arbitrate any claims you may have against CS on an individual basis.\nARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>\n<p>We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to keep up to date on how we are handling your personal information.</p>A.\nInformation Collected<p>We collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: (1) personal information.\nand (2) non-personal information.\n\"Personal information\" is information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you, your household, or device, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or company name.\n\"Non-personal information\" is information that does NOT identify you or your household personally.\nWe note, however, that throughout time, non-personal information could become personal information through regulatory developments, technological advancements, or co-mingling with personal information.\nWhere personal information and non-personal information are combined, we treat the combined set of information as personal information.</p>(1) Active Collection<p>We collect and store personal information from you directly, at the time you supply information to us via the Sites.\nFor instance, if you sign up for an account or contact us with a question, we may store your communications, including any personal information you include in them, so we can effectively respond to you.\nThe information we actively collect from you may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email address, first and last name, mailing address and billing information if you subscribe to the Sites.</li>\n<li>Email address if you contact us with a question or seek more information about us through the Sites.</li>\n<li>Name and email address if you enter or otherwise communicate in a chat room, blog or other public area on the Sites or on one of CS's social networking pages.</li>\n<li>Email address and name if you sign up to receive a newsletter from one of the Sites or if you otherwise request information from the Sites.</li>\n<li>Demographic Information, which may include your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Sites.\nWe use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Sites meets your needs.\nSocial media information, political affiliations, and interests, to get a better idea of how to serve you.</li>\n<li>Location information if you choose to allow us to track your location through the Sites or if your personal information indicates a certain geographic location.\nThis information may help us provide recommendations to you based on your location, serve you with advertisements, or direct you to products or services that we believe may be of interest to you and that is marketed to people near your location.</li>\n</ul>(2) Passive Collection<p>We may collect information passively while you are visiting or interacting with the Sites.\nWe call this \u201cpassive\u201d collection because you may not know that this information is being collected.\nThe information we passively collect from you may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Internet Protocol (IP) address.\nYour IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data - such as the webpages you view.\nWe use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Sites to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Sites.</li>\n<li>Cookies and other similar technologies.\nOne way that we collect information passively is through cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies.\nFor more information on cookies and similar technologies, please see section K below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For your reference, we have provided a chart of the

collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions).\nWe seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personal information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible.\nBecause such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer our Sites will have access to users' personal information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personal information to us.</li>\n<li>To fulfill a request made by you.\nFor example, if you email us a question or otherwise inquire about one of our services, we may use your email address to process your

statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</li>\n<li>To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information

used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookies and Web Beacons - We may use certain kinds of technology such as cookies and web beacons or work with third party web analytic service providers to collect information about how you use the Sites.\nAmong other things, the use of cookies and web beacons enables us to improve our services by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers or mobile devices accessing our services, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, to allow you to visit our Sites without re-entering your username and/or

visits and compile statistics on usage and effectiveness of our Sites.</li>\n<li>Google Analytics - To help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use Google Analytics and have implemented all Google Advertising Features, including Remarketing, Impression Reporting, and Demographics, and Interest Reporting.\nGoogle Analytics uses cookies to report on user interactions on our and others'

policy and instructions on opting out of Google Analytics here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html.\nNote that the opt-out is specific to Google activities and does not affect the activities of other ad networks or analytics providers that we may use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the particular advertising services they provide, these third party advertising

alteration of the information you provide us.\nWe may use third party products and services to secure or store your information.\nPlease understand that no data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nConsequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to CS is done at your own risk.\nWe use firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.\nHowever, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.</p>\n<p>If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nBy using these Sites or providing personal information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of these Sites.\nWe may post a notice on our Sites if a security breach occurs.\nWe may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances.\nDepending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>\n<p>The personal information record created through your registration with our Sites can only be accessed with the unique password associated with that record.\nTo protect the integrity of the information contained in this record, you should not disclose or otherwise reveal your password to third parties.\nYou agree that you are responsible for all acts or omissions that occur on your account while your password is being

WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nOther rights that you and we would have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.\nAll such Disputes shall be exclusively submitted to JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect in the Greenbelt, Maryland area, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Privacy Policy, including any claim that all or any part of this Privacy Policy is void or voidable.</p>P.\nChoice of Law<p>This Privacy Policy has been made in, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.\nThe parties acknowledge that this Privacy Policy evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nNotwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16).</p>Q.\nYour California Privacy Rights<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding
