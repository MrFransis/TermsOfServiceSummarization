GmbH<br>\nManaging Director: Mathias Fabian<br>\nVordere Sterngasse 4/6, D-90402, N\u00fcrnberg, Germany<br>\nCommercial Register: Amtsgericht N\u00fcrnberg, HRB 30815<br>\n<br>\n(hereinafter referred to as \"Operator\" or \"Playata GmbH\")<br>\nDetails on Playata GmbH can be found under the legal notice.<br>\n<br>\nThe worldwide marketing of the game (except for its gratuitous provision), including the delivery of virtual game currency against payment and/or other fee-based game contents, rests with:<br>\n<br>\nEuropean Games Group AG<br>\nBoard of Directors: Johannes Sevket G\u00f6zalan<br>\nSchellingstra\u00dfe 21<br>\nD-80799 M\u00fcnchen<br>\nCommercial Register: Munich Local Court, HRB 187516<br> For the avoidance of doubt: European Games Group neither acquires any rights nor enters into any obligations through these GTC.\nA contract between the user and European Games Group shall only come into effect if and to the extent to which the user acquires virtual currency or other game contents from European Games Group AG.\nSuch acquisition shall be exclusively subject to the Special Conditions of European Games Group AG (further below in this document).\nThese GTC do not govern the acquisition of virtual currency or other game contents against payment.\nIn the event of a contradiction between these GTC and the Special Conditions of European Games Group AG, the latter shall prevail.<br>\n<ol>\n<li>5.\nBy accepting these GTC, the user recognizes the version of these GTC that is applicable at the time of acceptance.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>6.\nThese GTC fully replace older versions of the GTC for Big Bang Empire.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>7.\nThe game contents and further service offers of Playata GmbH are continually further developed, updated and adapted.\nFor this reason, only the most recent version of the game contents is online at the user\u2019s disposal at each time.\nTo the extent that the user accesses the game using an application, he is recommended to always use the most recent version available for this application in order to avoid problems with the presentation and use of the game contents and other services.\nPlayata GmbH shall not be responsible for any adverse effects caused by the use of application versions which are not up to date.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>8.\nThe user's connection with the Internet itself, as well as the preconditions that the user's system has to fulfill to that effect, particularly the browser software used, do not fall within the services of Playata GmbH and thus do not form an integral part of these GTC.\nThe user is himself or herself responsible for ensuring the suitability, up-to-dateness and security of the hard- and software used.\nFor the avoidance of doubt: This shall not apply to applications which might have been made available by Playata GmbH and might serve to access game contents and/or services.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>9.\nThe use of service offers of Playata GmbH in relation to Big Bang Empire (including download and use of the applications) is free of charge in the basic version.\nHowever, certain features are only available to paying users (see Clause 5 of these GTC).<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>10.\nPlayata GmbH can provide the user with communication possibilities for own contents and contributions.\nThese may include, in particular, official forums on the Internet pages operated by Playata GmbH, which the user shall be allowed to use within the scope of their actual availability and in accordance with these conditions.\nIn this respect, Playata GmbH solely provides the technical possibilities for information exchange.\nHowever, an entitlement to the provision of such communication possibilities does not exist.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>11.\nIt is not possible for the operator to exercise direct control over all posted entries.\nThe operator is not in a position to ensure permanent online monitoring of the contributions of the visitors and members.\nTherefore, he does not assume responsibility for the contents, the accuracy and the form of individual posted entries.\nAs an author, every user shall be personally responsible for his or her entry.\nThe publication of illegal or offensive contributions and/or contributions that are liable to prosecution shall be expressly prohibited.\nEvery user shall at any time be obliged to comply with the existing legal provisions arising, for example, from penal law, youth protection law, trademark law, copyright law and the law on unfair competition.\nThe posting of commercial advertisements in the contributions in any form whatsoever, for example as text, link or by fading in banners, shall equally be prohibited.\nPlayata GmbH reserves the right to delete entries and to withdraw the write permission from individual users for a certain period or at all.\nFurthermore, the rules of the game pursuant to Clause 7 and the protection of copyrights and third-party rights pursuant to Clause 9 of these GTC shall apply.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 2 Conclusion of Contract and Contents<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nFor the mobile and platform versions of Big Bang Empire, the steps leading up to the conclusion of the contract may vary depending on the app store (e.g.\niTunes, Google Play, Amazon) and the platform (e.g.\nFacebook).\nThe operation of downloading the game from an app store and/or connecting the game with a social media account on a platform shall additionally be governed by the conditions of use of the relevant app store and/or the relevant platform.\nUnless expressly stated otherwise in the app store and/or the platform, separate registration after downloading the application (app stores) and/or after connecting the game with the [user\u2019s] own account (platforms) shall not be required.\nA contract governed by these GTC shall rather come into effect when the application is duly downloaded from the relevant app store and/or the game is duly connected with the user\u2019s own social media account on the platform.\nTo the extent that there is a possibility of connection with a social media account also within an application, such connection is voluntary and does not constitute a prerequisite for the conclusion of the contract.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nFor the browser version of Big Bang Empire as well as in cases in which separate registration is expressly required according to the product description in the respective app store and/or on the respective platform, the following shall apply for the conclusion of the contract:<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>a) By registering for and/or using the service offers, the user agrees to these GTC.\nIf an e-mail address is required for registration, the e-mail address must belong to the user personally and he or she must be regularly reachable at this address for the duration he or she uses the game, because Playata GmbH generally communicates via e-mail.\nAccordingly, the use of one-way addresses (so-called trash mails) shall be expressly prohibited.\nRegistration shall only be permitted to natural persons.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>b) In the course of registration the user may choose an admissible player\u2019s name (nickname).\nThe player\u2019s name must not violate any rights of third parties or be contrary to accepted principles of morality.\nAn entitlement to the attribution of a special user name does not exist.\nInadmissible user names are, in particular, e-mail and Internet addresses and words which do not correspond to the technical requirements communicated within the scope of the registration process (e.g.\nprohibition of certain special characters), if applicable.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>c) The presentation of the game and its contents, including the websites, features and other materials as well as related further services does not constitute a binding offer.\nOnly by completing the registration form does the user submit a binding offer to conclude a contract pursuant to Section 145 of the German Civil Code (BGB).\nTo do so, all data fields marked as necessary on the registration form must first be duly completed in accordance with Clause 2 Paragraph 2 of these GTC, and subsequently be confirmed by clicking the corresponding button.\nUpon receipt of the user\u2019s offer, the user will receive an automatically dispatched e-mail at the e-mail address the user has stated in the registration form.\nThis automatic e-mail confirms that we accept the user\u2019s offer.\nA contract with Playata GmbH does not come into force until the declaration of acceptance conveyed by this confirmation e-mail has been received.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>d) The user shall have no entitlement to registration, activation and participation in the game.\nPlayata GmbH shall be entitled to refuse to confirm and to accept the registration without giving reasons.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 3 User's Obligations<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nThe user assures that he or she is of legal age.\nTo the extent that the user is a minor, the latter assures that he or she has obtained an effective consent of his or her legal representatives.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nThe conclusion of the contract may only be performed personally, and must not be performed automatically or by third parties.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nThe user is only allowed to use the service offer with not more than one account per game world (server) of Big Bang Empire.\nThis means that it shall not be possible for a registered user to open a new account in the same game world unless the previous account has been deleted.\nThe creation and keeping of several accounts in the same game world (multi-accounts) is prohibited.\nSuch multi-accounts can be blocked and deleted at any time without previous warning at Playata GmbH's own discretion.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nThe user undertakes to use his or her account exclusively for private purposes in line with the service offers.\nCommercial use in whatever form shall be expressly prohibited.\nThis prohibition also includes the dissemination of advertisements and other commercial offers.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>5.\nThe account is person-related and expressly not transferable.\nTherefore, the user undertakes not to transfer his or her account to third parties, neither against payment nor by way of donation.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>6.\nThe user undertakes to keep his or her login data and especially his or her passwords strictly confidential and to protect them against unauthorized access by third parties.\nWhat we mean by \u201clogin data\u201d and/or \u201cpasswords\u201d are all letter and/or character and/or number strings used to authenticate the user with the aim to exclude access by unauthorized third parties.\nThe password must not be identical with the player's name and must include a combination of numbers and letters.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>7.\nThe user shall be prohibited from using the login data of another user.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>8.\nThe user undertakes to contact the operator directly if there is a suspicion that third parties have obtained or might have obtained the login data without authorization.\nIf a suspicion of abuse or a risk of abuse exists, Playata GmbH shall be permitted to block the accounts involved temporarily until the suspicion has been eliminated.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>9.\nManipulative interventions in the service offers are prohibited.\nThese include, in particular, the use of software and mechanisms disturbing the service offers or procuring an unfair advantage over fellow players to the user.\nAmong other things, the creation and/or use of hacks, mods, cheats, bots, data-mining tools and automated browser plugins shall be prohibited.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 4 Duties of Playata GmbH<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nDuring the term of this contract, Playata GmbH shall allow each user to participate in service offers of Big Bang Empire free of charge.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nPlayata GmbH shall guarantee an accessibility of at least 90% of the game contents on an annual average.\nThis refers to the capability of retrieval of the game contents of Big Bang Empire from the server of Playata GmbH via browsers or applications.\nPlayata GmbH shall assume no guarantee with respect to any connection errors by Internet service providers or breakdowns of third-party platforms (e.g.\nFacebook).\nLikewise, Playata GmbH shall provide no guarantee in the event of interruptions or disturbances needed to carry out maintenance work.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nPlayata GmbH undertakes to counteract the risk of data loss through reasonable data backup measures (backups).\nIn case of data loss, it is unfortunately impossible to reproduce game actions performed after the point in time when the backup was carried out.\nIn relevant cases, Playata GmbH shall endeavor to accommodate users concerned through playful activities in order to make good the damage suffered.\nHowever, the users cannot lay claim to such acts of generosity.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nFor clarification: These GTC shall apply irrespective of whether the game is offered as a mobile version (APP), browser version or version for social media platforms.\nHowever, this does not mean that Playata GmbH is obliged to offer the game in all these platform versions, or that one platform version of this game must be interoperable with another platform version of the game (i.e.\nthat the accounts for one version could also be used for another version, for example).<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 5 Features, Payments<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nThe download of applications, the connection of the game with social media accounts and registration (to the extent provided) as well as the use of the basic version of the game and of service offers are free of charge.\nItems and virtual game currency can be collected and/or won free of charge in the game.\nThe special items and the virtual game currency can be used to activate so-called features, i.e.\nindividual additional services compared with the basic version (hereinafter referred to as \"Features\"), in the game.\nThe exact description and functions of the respective features are shown in detail on the game and/or application website.\nIn addition, there is a possibility of acquiring game currency and certain items from European Games Group AG against payment (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not from Playata GmbH).<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nThere is no obligation for the user to acquire virtual game currency and features against payment.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nPlayata GmbH reserves the right to modify or cease to offer the nature, volume and contents of the features, and/or the right to offer them in the free basic version.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nAgainst payment of a fee, the user has the possibility of receiving special items and virtual game currency from European Games Group AG who shall be the exclusive contracting party at each time.\nThe payment for the virtual game currency and the method of payment are shown in detail on the game and/or application website and/or in the application.\nExcept as expressly stated otherwise, the prices are to be understood as final prices including taxes and any costs incurred for credit entries and/or provision (subject to country-specific modifications or deviations.\nthese are explicitly announced on the relevant game and/or application websites and in the app).The acquisition shall be subject to the Special Conditions of European Games Group AG (see further below in this document).\nin the event of contradictions between this Clause 5 and the Special Conditions of European Games Group AG, the latter shall prevail.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>5.\nEuropean Games Group AG shall be entitled to request payment for the acquisition of the virtual game currency in advance.\nThe payments for the acquisition of the virtual game currency shall be due immediately when the contract with European Games Group AG is concluded, i.e.\nwith the user's confirmation of the acquisition of special items or virtual game currency.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>6.\nThe payments systems available in each case (e.g.\nPayPal, credit card, Premium SMS) result from the Special Contractual Terms of European Games Group AG and the conditions of use of the relevant app store and/or the relevant platform, if applicable.\nThe user shall not be entitled to claim that European Games Group AG offer or maintain certain payment systems.\nPayments are collected in accordance with the user's choice.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>7.\nAt the request of European Games Group AG, Playata GmbH shall be entitled to block the account concerned of the user temporarily as long as the user is in default vis-\u00e0-vis European Games Group AG in respect of the payments for acquired items or virtual game currency.\nThe user's obligation to pay the agreed fee remains unaffected.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>8.\nPlaying options acquired within the game by means of virtual game currency (e.g.\nobjects, waiting time reductions, energy and other functions acquired thereby) and the virtual currency or the special items cannot be returned.\nin this respect, there is no obligation to reimburse the fee paid for the virtual game currency unless expressly otherwise agreed.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\nEuropean Games Group AG shall not be obliged to reimburse the virtual game currency if the user terminates the user contract.\nThis provision is without prejudice to the rules on the statutory right of revocation and its omission.<br>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 6 No Right of Revocation<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\nSince the use of the services, web presences, applications, features or contents and related further services of the game as such is free of charge for the user, a right of revocation shall not exist.\nThe termination of the agreement shall be governed by Clauses 10 and 11 of these GTC.\nThe Special Terms of European Games Group AG and their revocation instructions shall apply to the acquisition of virtual currency from European Games Group AG.<br>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 7 Rules of the Game<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nThe communication possibilities offered, if applicable, by Playata GmbH via the Internet pages, applications and service offers for the Big Bang Empire are intended for the user to have fun while playing the game.\nAbuse for other personal or commercial purposes (such as, e.g., advertising, political or religious expression of opinion) shall be prohibited.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nThe user recognizes with respect to all communication possibilities contained in the different service offers of Playata GmbH that Playata GmbH does not tolerate any news, postings or other contents which include the following:<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tdirty words, vulgar or obscene expressions or sexual contents, no matter whether express or implied;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\treligious, political or sociopolitical statements;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\toffensive, defamatory, threatening or otherwise annoying or harassing insinuations, comments and/or images;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tnames for game characters or user accounts that are deemed to be improper according to these GTC.\nin this case, Playata GmbH shall be entitled to delete such improper names or to proceed to renaming as a milder measure, in addition to the measures mentioned under Clause 8 Paragraph 2;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tthird-party material protected by copyright or trademark law without their express written approval;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tprompting of passwords and of personal information of other users (e.g.\nlast name, address, telephone number, birth date etc.);<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tlinks to commercial Internet pages of third parties;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tadvertisements including raffles, competitions or other sweepstakes;<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tcheat or hack programs or information or links to such programs or to Internet pages affirming that they have programs which misuse user passwords.\nor<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tother information which, at Playata GmbH's own discretion, is deemed to be age-inappropriate or unsuitable for this Internet page.<br>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nUsers who post contents shall be themselves responsible for ensuring that these contents do not violate any rights, in particular copyrights of third parties.\nHence, the users shall be themselves and directly responsible for all claims against third parties.\nShould Playata GmbH be held liable for such contents posted by a user, the user shall hold Playata GmbH harmless against any of the costs incurred by the posting of such contents to the extent that the user is to be held responsible for the violation.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nIt is prohibited to disturb the dialogue among different users knowingly.\ne.g.\nby interrupting a conversation among other members repeatedly, by annoying them or by creating enemy images or hostilities.\nMessages that users send to each other in the game are not private but public.\nTherefore, users are requested not to exchange personal information such as e-mail address, address, last name, telephone number, photographs, instant-message name or the like.\nPlayata GmbH urgently recommends not to disclose such personal data for reasons of self-protection.\nShould there be a suspicion that certain users try to obtain the above mentioned personal information from other users, Playata GmbH should be informed under the e-mail address support.us@bigbangempire.com.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>5.\nPlayata GmbH points out that full monitoring of the contents posted by the users cannot be ensured.\nHowever, spot checks are performed and the users additionally have the possibility of reporting violations by others.\nPrivate messages shall only be checked if a participant in the communication reports them as a violation.\nPlayata GmbH will then carry out a check as quickly as possible and edit or delete the contents, if necessary.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\nAn entitlement to the provision of communication possibilities does not exist.<br>\n<ol>\n<li>6.\nIn addition, the communication possibilities provided by mobile and platform versions of Big Bang Empire may be limited compared with the browser version owing to technical or legal reasons.\nThe user shall not be permitted to use programming errors (what is referred to as bugs) to his or her own advantage.\nIf a user detects a bug, he or she shall have to report it by sending an e-mail to support.us@bigbangempire.com.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>7.\nThe user shall be prohibited from any action causing excessive data volumes (traffic) or affecting the course of the game.\nIn particular, it shall be prohibited to use automated or semi-automated scripts that perform database queries or put game mechanisms into operation.\nLikewise, any manipulations of the data stored on the server shall be prohibited.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 8 Virtual Domiciliary Right<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nAll service offers and/or applications of Big Bang Empire, which are mentioned here, come under the virtual domiciliary right of Playata GmbH.\nVirtual domiciliary right means the right of the operator of a virtual space (in other words a website, application and/or service, for example) to verify whether the conduct of the users of this virtual space complies with the GTC and to take suitable measures in case of infringement.\nPlayata GmbH reserves the right to make unrestricted use of this virtual domiciliary right in case of need.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nIf a user violates the rules of conduct defined by these GTC, particularly the rules of the game and/or rules of conduct mentioned in Clause 7, Playata GmbH shall be entitled to block or to delete the relevant contents, users and/or game characters, and/or to exclude the user from the continued use of the service offers of Playata GmbH temporarily or, in line with the proportionality principle, permanently, and/or to delete his or her user account in order to protect the other users.\nIn this case, the user shall not be entitled to be reimbursed for a payment he or she has already made.\nLikewise, the user shall not be entitled to receive compensation of any other nature.\nPrior to initiating the above mentioned measures, Playata GmbH will, insofar as is reasonable, inform the user in order to clarify or remedy the violation.\nInforming the user is not reasonable, for example, if it could lead to the occurrence of a damage to Playata GmbH, European Games Group AG or to third parties.\nIf a user is blocked, he or she shall not be permitted to use Big Bang Empire by means of another game character.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 9 Copyrights and Industrial Property Rights.\nGranting of Rights<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nAll copyrights, rights of use and other intellectual property rights relating to Big Bang Empire, the applications and the service offers rest with Playata GmbH or are protected in favor of third parties.\nThe user shall be allowed to use the contents made available to him or her only within the scope of the service offers.\nWith respect to applications, the user merely receives a simple, non-transferable right which must neither be transferred nor sub-licensed and is limited in terms of time to the duration of this contract, to install and use the applications on his or her own devices enabled for the installation of applications from the relevant app store.\nThe user shall delete the applications prior to any alienation of such devices as well as at the end of the contract.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nWithout the express prior approval of Playata GmbH, which is to be obtained in writing, no user shall be permitted to use, copy, save, process, decompile, reverse engineer (prohibition of reverse engineering) and/or distribute any contents of the game, such as e.g.\ntexts, images, graphics, characters, logos, pieces of music, sounds, sound sequences, videos, programs, software codes and other information outside the use of service offers of Playata GmbH.\nThe user shall be permitted to place a link on the Internet pages operated by Playata GmbH to the extent that it exclusively serves as a cross-reference.\nHowever, Playata GmbH reserves the right to revoke this permission.\nAt any rate, it shall not be permitted to incorporate or represent the Internet pages and/or service and its contents, which are operated by Playata GmbH, in a partial window (frame) by means of a hyperlink.\nConsequently, the placing of inline or frame links shall have to be considered as illegal use.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nThe same applies to name rights and other labeling rights.\nAny use outside the service offers, especially in commercial transactions, shall be prohibited without explicit written approval.\nThis particularly applies to any merchandising articles.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nPlayata GmbH expressly points out the following: If a user offers his account or parts of it on the Internet for sale against payment, this represents an infringing act under copyright law and, if applicable, under labeling law to be prosecuted at the user's expense, besides being a violation of the essential obligations under these GTC.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 10 Duration of the Contract and Termination<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nThe user contract is concluded (in accordance with the conclusion of contract mechanisms described in Clause 2) between Playata GmbH and the user for an undefined period.\nThe user can terminate the contract at any time without notice and without giving reasons by (i) [for applications] deleting the application on his or her devices and in the settings in his or her account at the relevant app store, (ii) [for use via a platform] removing the connection of the game with the [user\u2019s] own social media account in the settings of the relevant platform, (iii) [if a browser version is used or registration is required] deleting his or her account or (iv) [in all cases] by e-mail to support.us@bigbangempire.com.\nAs a result of the termination, all information saved on the user's account, which is relevant to data protection legislation, shall be deleted or, to the extent that legal provisions require their retention, blocked and deleted only at the end of the retention period.\nThis is the user's e-mail address, among other things.\nTo the extent that such information is still contained in regular backup files, a manual solution would mean disproportionate efforts.\nIn such cases, the information will be deleted as soon as the backup is overwritten.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nPlayata GmbH can terminate the contractual relation at any time with a two-week period of notice without giving reasons.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nThe right to termination without notice for important grounds remains unaffected.\nPlayata GmbH shall be especially, but without limitation, entitled to termination without notice for important grounds in the cases mentioned in Clause 11 Paragraph 1.\nof these GTC.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nNotice of termination by Playata GmbH has to be given in text form (e-mail or message system within the Big Bang Empire game is sufficient).<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Clause 11 Sanctions and Termination without Notice/Exclusion from the Game<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nPlayata GmbH can give notice of termination to the user with immediate effect and exclude him or her from the service offers if,<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tcontrary to Clause 3 Paragraph 2., Clause 3 Paragraph 3 and Clause 3 Paragraph 5, he or she registers several accounts or transfers his or her account to third parties.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tcontrary to Clause 3 Paragraph 4., he or she uses his or her account for commercial purposes or for advertisements.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tcontrary to Clause 3 Paragraph 8, he or she misuses other users' login data.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\tcontrary to Clause 3 Paragraph 9, he or she performs manipulative interventions through software and mechanisms.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\the or she violates the rules of the game laid down in Clause 7 and does not stop violating them despite warning.\nIn the event of serious violations, a warning is dispensable if Playata GmbH cannot be expected to adhere to the contract.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\u2022\ther or she violates the copyrights and other

by European Games Group AG against Payment in the Big Bang Empire Game<br>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>1.\nScope of Application<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.1 The following Contract Terms shall apply exclusively to the acquisition of virtual currency and certain virtual items in the Big Bang Empire game (no matter whether as an application, via a platform or as browser version, irrespective of this hereinafter referred to as \u201cgame\u201d), and exclusively between European Games Group AG (registered in the Commercial Register of the Munich Local Court under HRB 187516, represented by its Board of Directors Johannes Sevket G\u00f6zalan, Schellingstra\u00dfe 21, D-80799 Munich (Germany), e-mail: contact@gamesgroup.eu, phone: +49 89 4444 93 18) and the user of the respective game (hereinafter referred to as \u201cuser\u201c) in their version valid at the time when the respective payable service is ordered and regardless of whether the respective game is offered via websites or other channels on PCs, similar stationary terminals or on smartphones, tablets or similar mobile terminals or via connected devices or other platforms or (social) networks.\nFor the avoidance of doubt: These Contract Terms shall not apply to the use of the game as such.\nThe use of the game requires a separate contract with the respective operator of the game, which is concluded in the course of the download or registration for the game.\nEuropean Games Group AG shall not responsible for failures, errors, unavailability or shortcomings of the game.\nDeviating conditions on the part of the user shall not be recognized, unless European Games Group AG expressly agrees to their validity in writing.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.2 In the event of contradictions between these Contract Terms of European Games Group AG and the conditions of the operator of the game (hereinafter referred to as \u201cGTC\u201d), the present Contract Terms of European Games Group AG shall have priority over the GTC of the operator.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.3 If the user acquires products or services from third-party providers (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthird-party providers\u201c) who advertise separately on the website of the game (e.g.\nso-called \u201cpartner offers\u201d), the contractual relationship between the user and the third-party provider shall be governed by the conditions of the third-party provider of these products and services.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.4 Fundamentally, the possibility of acquiring services also via app stores, from Google Play or in social networks can be granted in principle.\nIn such cases, European Games Group AG shall become the contractual partner of the user only to the extent provided by the conditions of the respective store or network.\nTo the extent that European Games Group AG becomes the contractual partner of the user, the acquisition of payable services in app stores, from Google Play or social networks shall nevertheless be primarily governed by the conditions of the social network, the Google Play store or the app store used for this purpose.\nin other words, the acquisition process shall depend in any case on the conditions of the respective network or store, and other conditions of the network or store shall have priority over these Contract Terms, unless they expressly give priority to the conditions of the provider on their part or allow deviating conditions of the supplier.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>1.5 The services of European Games Group AG are exclusively addressed to consumers.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>2.\nSubject Matter of the Contract<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.1 As the owner of the worldwide marketing and exploitation rights to the game, European Games Group AG shall be the user\u2019s contractual partner for the payable services of European Games Group AG.\nUsers shall have the possibility of acquiring<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>a) virtual currencies (so-called \u201cingame currency\u201d of the respective game, such as e.g.\ndonuts, stars, diamonds, etc.) and<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>b) other virtual items (\u201citems\u201d) or so-called premium features<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n(hereinafter a) and b) are jointly referred to as \u201cvirtual items\u201c)<br>\nagainst payment from European Games Group AG.<br>\n<ol>\n<li>2.2 The virtual items are not things within the meaning of Section 90 of the German Civil Code (BGB).\nEuropean Games Group AG therefore does not transfer the ownership of the items to the user, but merely a simple, non-transferable right of use limited to the duration of the user contract with the operator, which the user receives when the virtual items are credited to his or her account.\nTo the extent that \u201csale\u201d or \u201cbuy\u201d or similar terms are used in connection with the acquisition of virtual items, these shall refer to the granting of a right to use.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.3 In the game, the user can spend the items credited on his or her account in order to acquire advantages described there in detail or to acquire other virtual items, if the virtual items credited on his or her user account are sufficient.\nFurthermore, the user can use up the virtual items in the game.\nAs long as the user account is blocked or the user is excluded from utilization, European Games Group AG shall have a right to withhold performance.\nThe right to use shall end when the user has used up the virtual items in the game, however, at the latest when the user contract between the user and the operator of the game ends.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.4 Ingame currency does not represent real money.\nthere is no fixed exchange rate for it and it is not a means of payment or electronic money, neither according to the banking law, nor within the meaning of the Payment Services Supervision Act (Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz \u2013 ZAG), in particular.\nExchanging virtual items against real money shall be prohibited.\nThis also applies to virtual items won by the user during the use of the game.\nThe exchange or trade in virtual items shall be excluded.\nParagraph 6.2 of these Contract Terms remains unaffected.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>2.5 The user shall be prohibited from using the virtual items for commercial purposes.\nThe virtual items are intended for entertainment purposes.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>3.\nOffer and Conclusion of Contract<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.1 From among the range that European Games Group AG makes available for a game, the user can choose the type and quantity of the virtual items in the respective game, determine a payment method and submit a binding offer to buy the chosen virtual items by pressing the \u201cbuy against payment\u201d button or a button labeled similarly.\nHowever, the offer can only be submitted and transmitted if the user has previously accepted these Contract Terms and thus included them in his or her offer by clicking the button \u201cAccept the Special Conditions of European Games Group AG\u201d.\nThe contract with European Games Group AG takes effect by the crediting of the ordered virtual item to the user\u2019s account.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.2 The user can withdraw his or her offer pursuant to paragraph 3.1 until the steps that trigger off the payment process with the respective payment service provider have been completed.\nUntil then, input errors can also be corrected by clicking the \u201cBack to the game\u201d button in the game.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.3 The contract is concluded in the German language.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>3.4 The acquisition of virtual items in an app store shall primarily be governed by the conditions of the app store used for this purpose.\nIf the user acquires virtual items via an app store (so-called \u201cin-app acquisition\u201c), the contract shall be concluded between the user and the app store in principle (unless the conditions of the respective app store provide for a possibility of concluding of a contract directly between the user and European Games Group AG).\nThis shall apply accordingly if virtual items are acquired via social networks.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>4.\nPrices, Payment, Payment Methods<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.1 All prices are to be understood as gross final prices, i.e.\nincluding any resulting taxes and provision costs.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.2 European Games Group AG shall be entitled to request fees for the acquisition of the virtual items in advance.\nThe fees for the acquisition of the virtual items shall be payable in advance by the user as soon as the chosen payment service provider has sent the final order confirmation.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.3 European Games Group AG has joined recognized and trustworthy payment systems.\nPayments shall be made by choosing a certain payment system (e.g.\nPayPal, credit card, premium SMS) through the respective payment service provider.\nThe user is aware of the fact that a separate contract between him or her and the respective payment service provider regarding the realization of the transaction will regularly take effect in accordance with the provisions of the respective payment service provider.\nThe user shall not be entitled to demand that European Games Group AG offers or maintains certain payment systems.\nThe fees will be collected in accordance with the choice of the user.\nIf a so-called social game, Google Play store or app store is availed of, payment is generally only possible with the payment system provided by the corresponding social network, Google Play store or app store.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>4.4 In case of default, European Games Group AG shall be entitled to have the virtual items suspended and the corresponding user account blocked through the operator of the game.\nThe obligation of the user to pay the agreed fee remains unaffected hereof.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>5.\nREVOCATION INSTRUCTION<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>5.1 Right of revocation<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\nYou are entitled to revoke your contractual declaration for the acquisition of virtual items within fourteen days
