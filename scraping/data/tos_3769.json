EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO SUCH DISCLOSURE: <ul>\n<li> Usage Data.\nWe may provide Usage Data to our customers in connection with the Services which those customers use.\nFor example, our customers may include network providers or operators and we may disclose Usage Data to these customers in connection with the products and devices that are deployed over these customers\u2019 networks.\nThe treatment of Usage Data by these third-parties is subject to their own privacy policies, and not this one.\nWe are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of those third parties.\n</li>\n<li> Aggregate or De-identified Data.\nWe may share Non-Personally Identifiable Information, including Usage Data (such as anonymous or aggregate user usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, etc.), with certain third-parties to assist such third-parties in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services and/or functionality with respect to our Services.\nWe may also share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third-parties for marketing, research, or similar purposes.\n</li>\n<li> Business Transfers.\nIf we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if substantially all of the assets of one of our business activities are transferred to another company, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.\n</li>\n<li> Third Party Service Providers.\nWe may disclose certain User Information to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf (e.g., with vendors that help us with delivering Products to you, including transaction processing and fraud prevention, vendors that help us maintain our Sites, or analytics providers) and may be located in other countries.\nThese third-party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents perform technical operations such as database monitoring, data storage and hosting services and customer support software tools.\nThese third parties may access, process or store Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing these services but based on our instructions only.\nIf we receive Personally Identifiable Information subject to our certification under the Privacy Shield and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Privacy Shield if both (i) the agent processes the personal data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\n</li>\n<li> Other Disclosures.\nWe may also disclose User Information (1) if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is in compliance with state and federal laws (including, without limitation, copyright laws) or in response to a court order, subpoena, legal process, search warrant or request by a public authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n(2) if we believe, in good faith, such action is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or any terms applicable to specific Services, exercise our legal rights, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our Services, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users or others.\n(3) to any parent company, affiliated entity, or other entity controlled by, controlling, or under common control with, us (in which case, we will require such entities to honor this Policy).\nor (4) as otherwise described herein.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Public Information.\nPlease note that if you choose to share information about yourself in any discussion forum or public areas of our Services (such as the Community Forum or review boards on the Ubiquiti World Network) we consider that information to be public information.\nAny personal information that you include in any content submitted or posted when using the public areas of our Services can be viewed by the general public, so please consider this before submitting any such information or content.\nYou are solely responsible for any information, including any Personally Identifiable Information, you disclose on the discussion or public areas of our Services, and any use of such information by any third-parties regardless of whether you permitted or did not permit such use.\nWe cannot control how others use the information that you post to public areas of our Services.\n</li>\n<li> Cookies and Other Tracking Technology.\nWe may use cookies, web beacons, local stored objects (LSOs), JavaScript and similar technology in connection with your use of some of our Services, including our Sites and Mobile Apps, to collect Usage Data and other analytics data.\nWe may also permit third-parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect usage and analytics data on our Sites and Mobile Apps.\nIn addition, some of our Services may use analytic software (which may be provided by third-parties) to collect further Usage Data regarding the usage patterns of our users.\nWe may combine Usage Data with the other information we collect (including Personally Identifiable Information), which could enable us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.\n<ul>\n<li> Cookies.\nCookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer\u2019s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.\nMost web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them.\nThe \u201cHelp\u201d portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable or delete cookies altogether.\nSome features of the Services may not function with cookies disabled.\nCookies are grouped into four categories: <ul>\n<li>\n<i>Strictly necessary cookies</i>.\nSome cookies are strictly necessary for you to be able to experience the full functionality of our Sites.\nFor example, these cookies allow you to use the website and log-in to your account as intended.\nWe also use cookies to direct you to the right website based on geography and language and to detect and prevent security threats.\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Performance cookies</i>.\nPerformance cookies tell us about how you use the site and they help us to make it better.\nFor example, these cookies count the number of visitors to our website and see how visitors move around when they are using it.\nThis helps us to improve the way our Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users find what they are looking for easily.\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Functional cookies</i>.\nFunctional cookies allow the Sites to remember your preferences, helping you to customize your content on our Sites.\nThis type of cookie enables us to highlight products and services we believe is of interest and relevance to you.\nThis way we can remember you when you return to our site and to give you best possible user experience.\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Targeting cookies</i>.\nTargeting cookies allow us to show more relevant advertising by serving you information, offers and promos that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our sites and apps.\nThese cookies may also be set through our sites by our advertising partners.\nFor more information on third party cookies, please review Section 5(d) and 5(e).\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Local Storage Objects.\nWe may use Local Storage Objects (\"LSOs\"), including Flash LSOs, to store your preferences and to personalize your visit to our site and use of our Services.\nLSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.\nTypically, you cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of LSOs through your web browser.\nFor more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go here.\n</li>\n<li> Web Beacons.\nWeb beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages.\nWe may use web beacons (including clear GIFs) in connection with our Sites, Web Apps and Mobile Apps to, among other things, track the activities of users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage.\nWe and our third-party service providers may also use web beacons in HTML emails to our customers, to help track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.\n</li>\n<li> Third-Party Tracking.\nOur Sites currently do not honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser signals.\nWe use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.\nThis service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.\nYou can learn about Google\u2019s practices by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\n</li>\n<li> Ad Networks <ul>\n<li> We may use third-parties, such as network advertisers, to display advertisements on third-party websites and mobile apps, on our behalf.\nNetwork advertisers are third-parties that display advertisements based on your use of our Services and other third-party website and mobile applications.\nThis enables us and these third-parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.\nThese third-parties may use cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.\nThese third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third-party\u2019s specific privacy policy, not this one.\nWe may provide third-party advertisers with aggregate or de-identified information about your usage of our Services.\nWe do not share your Personally Identifiable Information with these third-parties, and we do not permit these third-parties to use cookies and other tracking technologies placed on our Site to automatically collect Personally Identifiable Information about users.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising.\n</li>\n<li> You may opt out of many website third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (\"DAA\").\nFor more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp and www.aboutads.info/choices.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Your Choices.\nIn addition to the actions you may take related to Cookies and Tracking Technology describe above in Section 5, you may consider the following: <ul>\n<li> Marketing Communications.\nWe may share User Information with our affiliates who may use such information to send you promotional emails.\nConsistent with federal CANSPAM laws, you may opt out of receiving marketing emails from us by following the opt-out instructions contained in any marketing email we send you.\nPlease note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for us to process opt-out requests.\nIf you opt out of receiving marketing emails from us, we may still send you emails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us.\n</li>\n<li> Account Information.\nIf you maintain an account with us, you may modify your account information by logging into your account and updating your information.\nPlease note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain in our systems, and may also be viewable in cached and archived pages of our Sites for a period of time.\nAdditionally, if you discontinue using our Services or update your account information, we may retain the data previously collected about you.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Data Security.\nWE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT THE USER INFORMATION FROM LOSS, MISUSE, AND UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, DISCLOSURE, ALTERATION AND DESTRUCTION.\nPLEASE BE AWARE THAT DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, NO DATA SECURITY MEASURES CAN GUARANTEE 100% SECURITY.\nYOU SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND THE INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE VIA YOUR ACCOUNT BY, AMONGST OTHER THINGS, SIGNING OFF AFTER USING A SHARED COMPUTER, CHOOSING A ROBUST PASSWORD THAT NOBODY ELSE KNOWS OR CAN EASILY GUESS, AND KEEPING YOUR LOG-IN AND PASSWORD PRIVATE.\nWE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOST, STOLEN OR COMPROMISED PASSWORDS OR FOR ANY ACTIVITY ON YOUR ACCOUNT VIA UNAUTHORIZED PASSWORD ACTIVITY.\n</li>\n<li> Third-Party Links.\nOur Services may contain links to third-party websites and products and services offered by third parties.\nAny access to and use of such linked websites or third-party products and services is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third-parties.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of such third-parties.\n</li>\n<li> Children's Privacy.\nWe do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under thirteen (13) years of age, and no part of our Services is directed to children under thirteen (13) years of age.\nIf we learn that Personally Identifiable Information of children under thirteen (13) years of age has been collected on or through our Services, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information from our systems.\nIf you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under thirteen (13) years of age has provided Personally Identifiable Information to us, then you may alert us here and request that we delete your child\u2019s Personally Identifiable Information from our systems.\n</li>\n<li> Special Notes to International Users.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Data Transfer</i>.\nMost of our Services are hosted in the United States.\nIf you are accessing our Services from outside of the United States, where laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure differ from United States laws, please be advised that your continued use of our Services will be governed by United States law, this Policy, and any other terms applicable to our Services.\nUser Information may be transferred to, processed in, and held in countries other than the one in which you reside (including the United States).\nIf you are located in a country outside the United States and submit User Information to us, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Policy and to the transfer of that User Information to, or storage of that information in, the United States or other locations in which information is stored.\nIn accordance with Section 13 herein, we remain committed to subject all Personally Identifiable Information received from the European Union to the Privacy Shield principles, including the Supplemental Principles (available here) in reliance on the Privacy Shield.\n</li>\n<li>\n<i>Right to Access</i>.\nSome international users have certain legal rights to access certain Personally Identifiable Information we hold about them and to obtain its correction, amendment or deletion.\nThose users may contact the Legal Department as described in Section 14.\nPlease be advised that because our personnel have a limited ability to identify and access an individual user\u2019s Personally Identifiable Information that our customer has submitted to the Services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, we may first refer your request to the customer who submitted your Personally Identifiable Information, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request.\nIf you would like us to delete your Personally Identifiable Information, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.\nThere may be a brief delay in our processing that request, while we verify that the request is valid and originates from you as opposed to an unauthorized third party.\nWe reserve the right to terminate and/or limit your access to the Services, as we may need such information to provide the Services to you.\nWe may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> California Privacy Rights.\nIf you are a California resident, you may request a list of certain third-parties, if any, to which we have disclosed your Personally Identifiable Information for their own direct marketing purposes.\nYou may make one request per calendar year.\nIn your request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for your response.\nYou may request this information in writing by contacting us using the contact information in Section 14 below.\nPlease allow up to thirty (30) days for a response.\n</li>\n<li> Changes and Updates to this Policy.\nTHIS POLICY MAY BE REVISED PERIODICALLY AND THIS WILL BE REFLECTED UNDER \u201cDATE LAST MODIFIED\u201d BELOW.\nIF WE MAKE ANY CHANGE TO THE WAY IN WHICH WE TREAT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION, WE MAY INFORM YOU OF SUCH CHANGE VIA EMAIL OR BY POSTING A NOTICE IN THIS POLICY OR ON ANY OF OUR SITES, DEPENDING UPON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGE.\nYOUR CONTINUED ACCESS OR USE OF OUR SERVICES AFTER ANY CHANGES BECOME EFFECTIVE CONSTITUTES YOUR CONSENT TO, AND AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY, THE REVISED POLICY IN RELATION TO THE USER INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM YOU OR YOUR DEVICES.\nANY REVISIONS TO THIS POLICY WILL BE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE DATE INDICATED ABOVE.\n</li>\n<li> European Union Privacy Shield.\n<p> We, including Ubiquiti Inc., Ubiquiti Energy, LLC, 6408 Equipment LLC, Ubiquiti Distribution LLC and Ubiquiti Labs, LLC, comply with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.\nWe have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit

procedures have been exhausted, you may invoke binding arbitration.\nWe also commit to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with advice given by the panel with regard to human resources data transferred from a European country participating in the Privacy Shield in the context of the employment relationship.\nWe are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC).\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nCopyright \u00a9 2021 Ubiquiti Inc.\nAll rights reserved.\nCompany

intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of Products, and are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond Ubiquiti\u2019s

Resolution and Arbitration.\n<ul>\n<li> MANDATORY ARBITRATION.\nArbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons having a dispute agree to waive their right to file a lawsuit to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead agree to present their dispute to a neutral third party (arbitrator) for binding decision.\nYou have the right to opt-out of this provision which means that You retain Your right to file a lawsuit.\nto do so, You must read carefully and follow the directions under Section (IX)(b).\nUnless You Opt Out of the Mandatory Arbitration, You will be understood to have agreed to the mandatory arbitration and to the provisions provided below.\n<ul>\n<li> Please read this carefully.\nIt affects Your rights.\nYOU AND UBIQUITI AND ITS RESPECTIVE CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS, PERMITTED ASSIGNS, AND ANY OTHER PARTIES ON WHOSE BEHALF YOU ARE ACCESSING, DOWNLOADING OR USING THE SERVICES AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED BELOW.\nTHE TERM \u201cDISPUTE\u201d MEANS ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY NOW OR IN THE FUTURE BETWEEN YOU AND UBIQUITI WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, OR NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND INCLUDING THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY OR SCOPE OF THIS PROVISION (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER CLAUSE BELOW) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND/OR USE OF THE SERVICE AND/OR THE TERMS ACCOMPANYING THAT SERVICE.\nFOR EACH SERVICE USED, ACCESSED OR DOWNLOADED, THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WOULD APPLY UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT- OUT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.\n\u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral, third-person arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nPlease visit https://www.iccwbo.org for more information.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> How to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the above, You or Ubiquiti may choose to file a lawsuit in court rather than resolving Your Dispute by arbitration.\nYou may opt-out of mandatory arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies for small claims court (there are monetary limitations for small claims court), or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\nIn order to opt out of mandatory arbitration, You need to (I) mail written notification to Ubiquiti Inc., Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017.\nor (II) email written notification to legal@ui.com.\nIn either case, Your written notification must include: (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) a copy of Your receipt or other proof of purchase, showing the date of purchase, and (4) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Ubiquiti through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out of this provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Ubiquiti.\nAny opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your Dispute in arbitration or, if the dispute qualifies, in small claims court.\n</li>\n<li> Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution: For all disputes, whether pursued in court or in mandatory arbitration, You must first give Ubiquiti written notification and forty-five (45) days to resolve the Dispute.\nThe written notification shall include the information listed above in the preceding Section IX(b) items (1) -(3) plus (4) a written description of Your Dispute and (5) a written description of the relief You seek (\u201cDemand Information\u201d).\nIt is to be sent to Ubiquiti Inc., Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017.\nIf Ubiquiti does not resolve the dispute within 45 days, You may pursue Your dispute in arbitration.\nYou may pursue Your dispute in a court only under the circumstances described above in Section IX(b), the Opt Out provision.\n</li>\n<li> Arbitration Process.\n<ul>\n<li> Commencing Arbitration.\nA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by a reputable courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a \u201cNotice\u201d), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by You to Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti can send to You by any other method available to Ubiquiti for sending such notice, including via e-mail.\nThe Notice to Ubiquiti should be addressed to Ubiquiti Inc., Legal Department, 685 Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017 (the \u201cArbitration Notice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice shall include the Demand Information (the \u201cDemand\u201d).\nTHE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION (\u201cICDR\u201d) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION RULES (THE \u201cRULES\u201d), AS MODIFIED HEREIN.\nThe Rules are available at https://www.icdr.org.\nExcept as otherwise set forth herein, if You are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti will, within ten (10) business days of receipt of Your confirmed payment of the filing fee, reimburse You for the amount of Your confirmed payment of the filing fee that exceeds the amount of any fees You would be required to pay if the Demand were filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York.\n</li>\n<li> Arbitration Proceeding.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in English and a translator may be utilized as the expense of the party requiring the translation services.\nA single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in New York, New York will be appointed pursuant to the Rules.\nYou and Ubiquiti agree to the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (a) subject to the Rules, the arbitration shall be conducted online via videoconference, telephonically and/or be solely based on written submissions-rather than requiring the personal appearance of the parties-with the specific manner to be mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties and (b) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</li>\n<li> No Class Actions.\nYOU AND UBIQUITI AGREE THAT YOU AND UBIQUITI MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.\nIF YOU CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR DISPUTE IN COURT BY OPTING OUT OF THIS PROVISION, AS SPECIFIED ABOVE, THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nNEITHER YOU, NOR ANY OTHER USER OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICES CAN BE A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER, OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING WITHOUT HAVING COMPLIED WITH THE OPT-OUT REQUIREMENTS ABOVE.\n</li>\n<li> Decision of the Arbitrator.\nBarring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within one-hundred and twenty (120) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.\nThe arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional thirty (30) days in the interests of justice upon written notice by the arbitrator to You and Ubiquiti at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the last date to issue his or her decision.\nFailure to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis for challenging the arbitration award.\nAll arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award.\nThe award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim.\nThe arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of New York in conducting the arbitration.\nYou acknowledge that these Terms and Your use of any Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\nThe United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory Arbitration clause in these Terms.\n</li>\n<li> Arbitration Award.\nThe arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Equitable Relief.\nPunitive Damages.\n<ul>\n<li> You acknowledge that, in the event Ubiquiti or a third party breaches these Terms, the damage or harm, if any, caused to You will not entitle You to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Ubiquiti, and Your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these Terms.\n</li>\n<li> You and Ubiquiti agree that the arbitrator is not authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party\u2019s actual damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in these terms.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Jury Waiver.\nYou understand and agree that by failing to opt out to the Mandatory Arbitration provision in Sections IX(a)-(g), You and Ubiquiti are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in public court.\nIn the absence of this provision, You and Ubiquiti might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in court, before a judge or jury and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, those rights are waived.\n</li>\n<li> Enforceability.\nIf only Section IX(d)(iii) or the entirety of Sections IX(a)-(g) are found to be unenforceable, then Sections (IX)(a)-(g) will be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section IX(h) and Section (IX)(i) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.\n</li>\n<li> Governing Law.\nThese Terms shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted under the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof or the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods).\n</li>\n<li> Jurisdiction.\nThe parties agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the courts of New York, county and city of Manhattan, or the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in Sections IX(a)-(g).\nBoth You and Ubiquiti consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.\nprovided, however, that Ubiquiti reserves the right to institute proceedings against You in the courts having jurisdiction in the places where You reside, do business, have assets, or in any jurisdiction where a harm to Ubiquiti is occurring or has occurred.\nIn any action or proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorney\u2019s fees.\nNotwithstanding anything herein (including the mandatory arbitration provision above in Sections IX(a)-(g)), in the event You infringe or misappropriate any of Intellectual Property Rights, Ubiquiti is entitled to seek any permanent or temporary remedies (including, without limitation, compensation for damages, ceasing of infringement act, injunctive reliefs) against You in accordance with the applicable laws of Your resident country or the jurisdiction where such infringing act has transpired.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Export Restrictions.\n<ul>\n<li> You acknowledge that the
