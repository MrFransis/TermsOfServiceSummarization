request.\n</p>\n<strong>6.6 Non-Discrimination.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deny you goods or services.</li>\n<li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6.7 Online Tracking Choices.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept Cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all Cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, some features and services of the Site (particularly those that require sign-in) may not function properly if your Cookies are disabled.\nSimilarly, if you choose to delete session objects from our Site, you may not be able to access and use all or part of the site or benefit from some or all of the information or features and services offered.\n<br>\n<br> Some web browsers incorporate a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201c<b>DNT</b>\u201d) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have the user\u2019s online activity and behavior tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about that browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many websites, including the Site, do not respond to DNT signals.\n</p>\n<strong>7 SAFETY AND INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>7.1 Security.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the security of your information that we maintain in connection with your use of the Site.\nFor example, we encrypt all data with secure sockets layer (SSL) or similar technologies when we transmit your data.\nThis, however, does not guarantee that your information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical or managerial safeguards.\nIn the event that any of your Personal Information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you, as appropriate, in accordance with pertinent laws and regulations.</p>\n<strong>7.2 Storage.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>We or our third party hosting providers store Personal Information in operating environments that are safeguarded against public or unauthorized access and protected from internal access with physical and technical security measures.\nWhile these measures are helpful to safeguard your Personal Information after we receive it, no transmission of data over the internet is 100% secure.</p>\n<strong>8 NOTICE TO USERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Please be aware that we have offices in the United States.\nThe Site is governed by United States law.\nIf you are using any of our products or services from outside
