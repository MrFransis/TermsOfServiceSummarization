Cookie Policy of Hacker Noon <p> This document informs Users about the technologies that help this Website to achieve the purposes described below.\nSuch technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with this Website.\n</p>\n<p> For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br> For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker.\nFor this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\n</p>\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent, depending on the applicable law.\nWhenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>This Website uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers).\nUnless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br> The validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider.\nSome of them expire upon termination of the User\u2019s browsing session.<br> In addition to what\u2019s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated
