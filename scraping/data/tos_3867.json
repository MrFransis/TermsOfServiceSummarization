to: Expeditiously block access to or remove content that it believes in good faith may contain material that infringes the copyrights of third parties and remove and discontinue the Service to repeat offenders.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \u201cDMCA\u201d) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.\ncopyright law.\nIf you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through the Service infringes your copyright, you may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.\nThe notice must include the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\n(ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works).\n(iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Service (please include, both, source and destination IP addresses and GMT timestamp for the infringing material when submitting the notice).\n(iv) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party.\n(v) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\nIf you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice.\nNotices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.\nsee http://www.copyright.gov/ for details.\nDMCA notices and counter-notices regarding the Service should be sent to: Attn: DMCA Connectify 1429 Walnut Street, Suite 201 Philadelphia, PA 19102 Email:dmca@connectify.me Please send only DMCA notices to our Designated Copyright Agent via dmca@connectify.me, the email address we have registered with the Copyright Office pursuant to

Syria and any organization named on the United States Commerce Department\u2019s \u201cDenied Parties List\u201d) or otherwise in violation of any applicable restrictions or regulations.\nYou understand and agree that the Service may contain information that is controlled and restricted from export by United States export controls.\nIf Connectify, in its sole discretion, determines that it cannot implement the Service in a manner to exclude access to controlled information where required, if you are in a country or territory that is subject to such regulation, you shall not be provided access to the Service.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Moneyback Guarantee and Refund Policy</b>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Connectify is dedicated to satisfying the users the Service, so we offer a very generous
