into the bank account from which you paid for the transaction within 1 working day that triggered the entitlement to Cashback, subject to the following limitations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We reserve the right not to make a payment of Cashback if these Terms are terminated by you or Us before a Cashback payment becomes due.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The exact amount of Cashback you will receive is set by
