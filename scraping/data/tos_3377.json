LOSSES AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (WHETHER GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, INCOME OR PROFITS), WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR

SERVICES INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU THROUGH THE SITE, OR THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE, BY YOUR USE OF THE

SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p>\nIf we end up in a legal dispute with you, Wisconsin law will apply.\n<p>These Terms of Use or any claim, cause of action or dispute (\u201cclaim\u201d) arising out of or related to these Terms of Use shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Wisconsin, notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles.\nAdditionally, you agree that all claims must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Wisconsin, except as described in the immediately following paragraphs regarding arbitration.</p>\nYou agree to resolve disputes through arbitration.\n<p>\n<strong>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Site, or to any products or services sold or distributed by us or otherwise through the Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court</strong>, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to these Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 1201 Hays Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32301.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives, and the arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms of Use and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review.</p>\n<p>If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration).</p>\n<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms of Use must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred.\nFor purposes of this section, these Terms of Use and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsec.\n1-16 (FAA).</p>\nWe are not responsible for third party websites.\n<p>The Site may contain links and interactive functionality interacting with the websites of third parties, including social networking

authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand (6) a statement by you, under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed.</p>\nThese general terms apply to these Terms of Use.\n<p>You are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing the Site through your mobile access provider.</p>\n<p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render these Terms of Use enforceable and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the intention of the provision.\nif a court finds the modified provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will not be affected in any way.</p>\n<p>You agree that these Terms of Use constitutes the entire, complete and exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the Site and the services offered on it and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of these Terms of Use by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or subsequent similar or other breaches.</p>\n<p>If you have

transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise).\nAlso, In the event that all or a part of our business is merged, sold or reorganized (including transfers made as a part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings), personal information about you could be shared with the successor business.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To enforce or apply your contractual obligations to us, including for billing and collection purposes.<br>

Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have disclosed and/or sold personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months.\n<em>For more information, see </em>\n<em>table above</em>.\nWe do not sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our websites are general audience websites.\nWe do not permit anyone who tells us they are under the age of 13 to register or open an account with us.\nWe also do not collect information from anyone that tells us they are under the age of 13.\nChildren under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any contact information to anyone online.\nWe urge parents and guardians to participate in their children\u2019s online activities and use parental controls or other web filtering technology to supervise children\u2019s access to the internet.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are small text files located in your browser directory that may be placed on your device.\nWhen a website is accessed, a cookie that is placed on a device will send information to the party that has placed the cookie.\nCookies are extremely common and used on a number of websites.\nEach cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the \u201clifetime\u201d of the cookie, and a value (usually a unique number).</p>\n<p>Our websites may place first party cookies and allow third parties to place cookies on your device.\nThe difference between a first party cookie and a third party cookie relates to the control of the party who serves the cookie.\nFirst party cookies are cookies that are specific to the website that created them.\nWe use first party cookies to provide you with a good experience and allow us to improve our websites.\nThird party cookies, on the other hand, are placed on your device by a third party (i.e., not by us).\nWhile we may allow third parties access to our websites to place these cookies on users\u2019 devices, we do not retain control over the information supplied by the cookies, nor do we retain access to that data.\nThis information is controlled wholly by that third party in accordance with its privacy policy.</p>\n<p>You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies.\n(These settings are usually found in the \u201coptions\u201d or \u201cpreferences\u201d menu of your internet browser, and you should use the \u201cHelp\u201d option in your internet browser for more details.)

understand our customers better.\nWhen we send you e-mails we use these technologies as follows so that we can track e-mail open and click rates.\nWe also use web beacons to determine a user\u2019s ability to receive HTML e-mail.\nWeb beacons do not collect any personal data.\nUsers that do not want to receive e-mail messages with web beacons can choose to receive their e-mails in text (non-HTML) format.</p>\n<p>We do not currently respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d (DNT) signals.\nDNT is the concept that has been promoted by regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), for the internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.\nCurrently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference.\nYou can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.\nHowever, there is no industry standard for DNT available to us at this time.</p>\n<p>For more information about online tracking and various opt-out mechanisms, visit https://youradchoices.com/.</p>\n<p>Because we link to social media sites, and from time to time may include third-party advertisements, other parties may collect your personally information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you visit our websites.</p>\n<p>In addition, we use Google AdWords, so we are advertising our websites online through a form of tracking called remarketing.\nThird party vendors, including Google, show our ads on various sites across the internet, and use cookies to serve you ads based on your past visits to our websites.\nYou can opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting Google\u2019s Ads Settings

again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of the data you provide to us.\nOur servers are protected by firewalls and are physically located in secure data facilities to further increase security.\nWhile no computer or facility is 100% safe from outside attacks, we believe that the steps we have taken to protect your personally identifiable information dramatically reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate for the type of data involved.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E-mails</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may receive e-mail messages from us.\nIf you no longer wish to receive these communications, let us know by following the opt-out directions on any of the e-mail messages you have received from us.\nPlease note that if you wish to opt-out of receiving e-mails from independently owned and operated Ashley HomeStore retail furniture stores you will need to contact them directly to communicate your contact preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our privacy policy or any claim, cause of action or dispute (\u201cclaim\u201d) arising out of or related to our privacy policy shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Florida, notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles.\nAdditionally, you agree that all such claims must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Florida, except as described in the immediately following paragraphs regarding arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>You agree to resolve disputes through arbitration.</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to our privacy policy will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to our privacy policy.</p>\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of our privacy policy as a court would.</p>\n<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 1201 Hays Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32301.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives, and the arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of our privacy policy and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review.</p>\n<p>If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration).</p>\n<p>Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to our privacy policy must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred.\nFor purposes of this section, our privacy policy and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsec.\n1-16 (FAA).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Data Rights, Including Access, Deletion, and Opt-Out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you what information we collect, use, disclose, and sell.\nYou also have the right to request that we delete any personal information about you which we collected about you.\nTo submit either of the above requests, click https://preferences.ashleyfurniture.com, send an email to privacyoffice@ashleyfurniture.com, or call 800-757-0064.\nWe reserve the right to deny your request if we cannot verify your identity.</p>\n<p>You have the right to direct us to not sell your information.\nJust click our Do Not Sell My Personal Information request located https://preferences.ashleyfurniture.com, send an email to privacyoffice@ashleyfurniture.com, or call 800-757-0064.</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of these data rights.</p>\n<p>You may designate an authorized agent to make a request to exercise your rights on your behalf.\nYour authorized agent must be able to provide to us all of the information that we would otherwise require to verify your identity.\nFor your protection, we reserve the right to deny any request from an agent who does not submit proof that they have been authorized to act on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Applicable laws may give you additional rights that are not described in the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>California Privacy Rights \u2013 \u201cShine the Light\u201d</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of California Civil Code, a California resident with whom we have established a business relationship has the right to request from us certain information with respect to the types of personally identifiable information we have shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third parties, and the identities of the
