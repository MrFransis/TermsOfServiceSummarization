Sponsorship Policy", "url": "https://www.healthline.com/advertising-policy", "xpath": null, "text": "SubscribeAd &amp.\nSponsorship Policy<p>Written by the Healthline Team.\nFebruary 2020.</p>\n<p>Healthline Media\u2019s mission is to be your most trusted ally in your pursuit of health and well-being.\nWe\u2019re committed to bringing you authoritative, approachable, and actionable content that inspires and guides you toward the best possible health outcomes for you and your family.\nThe content and experiences produced by Healthline Media are created under strict editorial and medical guidelines to ensure accuracy, currency and clarity.\nHealthline Media is funded through the sale of advertising that appears on its properties, which include websites, apps, social media and partner publications.\nBe assured that we\u2019re absolutely inflexible about our editorial autonomy.\nOther than input about broad topic areas, we never allow sponsors to influence Healthline Media\u2019s editorial content.\nIn some cases, Healthline Media may create co-branded or branded content in partnership with our sponsors, and/or present content created by our sponsors.\nThis content is ALWAYS clearly labeled, and is detailed in sections 5 and 6 below.</p>\n<p>Here are the specific guidelines we follow about the types of advertising we accept:</p>\n<strong>1.\nWe review the ads.</strong>\n<p>We maintain sole discretion for determining the types of ads that will be accepted and displayed on Healthline Media properties.\nWe reserve the right to reject, cancel, or remove any ads at any time and for any reason.\nWe will provide prompt notice to the advertiser upon rejection, cancellation, or removal of any ad, along with an explanation.\nWe also reserve the right to determine the appropriate placement of ads on Healthline Media properties.</p>\n<strong>2.\nWe don\u2019t endorse any advertised products or services.</strong>\n<p>Although products may appear on our site in the form of advertisements, under no circumstances shall our acceptance of any ad be considered an endorsement of the product(s) and/or service(s) advertised, or for the company that manufactures, distributes, or promotes these product(s) or service(s).\nIn some cases, Healthline Media\u2019s editorial team may rate or rank certain products or services.\nThese ratings or rankings are determined solely by the editorial team(s) without regard to any financial or advertising relationship that may exist with companies that provide the product or services.</p>\n<strong>3.\nWe will not accept certain types of ads.</strong>\n<p>We will not accept any ad that is factually inaccurate and/or, in our opinion, in poor taste.\nPharmaceutical advertising is only accepted for approved indication(s) as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nAdvertised products must be in market and readily available.\nHealthline Media will not permit, at any time, the placement of any ad for harmful, illegal or objectionable products or services.\nAds must not contain fraudulent, deceptive, or offensive material, including material that misrepresents, ridicules, or attacks an individual or group on the basis of age, color, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or disability.\nAds must not be related to alcohol, firearms, ammunition, fireworks, gambling, pornography, tobacco, or the simulation of news or an emergency.\nAll ads must clearly identify the advertiser.\nAny ad that could be misconstrued as editorial content will be clearly labeled as an advertisement.</p>\n<strong>4.\nWe clearly distinguish ads from editorial content.</strong>\n<p>In every instance, we maintain a distinct separation between advertisements and editorial content.\nAll ads on Healthline Media properties are clearly and unambiguously identified as such.\nClicking on an ad will take the user to an advertiser\u2019s site or to a sponsor\u2019s resource center hosted on a Healthline Media property.\nSponsored resource centers are labeled as such, with the name of the sponsoring entity displayed.</p>\n<strong>5.\nWe clearly distinguish between sponsored and non\u00ad-sponsored content.</strong>\n<p>Healthline Media seeks sponsorships from trusted and credible research organizations, manufacturers, and other service providers.\nSponsorships provide financial benefit to Healthline Media, but also benefit our users by providing current information on health services, medications, and treatments.\nEditorial content sponsored by an advertiser is subject to our editorial policy and is reviewed by our editorial staff and Medical Affairs team.\nWhen content is provided by or influenced by a named sponsor, we take meaningful steps to ensure our users will not confuse that sponsored content with Healthline Media\u2019s own original editorial content.\nHere are the types of sponsored content Healthline Media presents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Sponsored content</strong>: Sponsored content refers to content that is created by Healthline Media covering a topic area that is relevant to an advertiser.\nHealthline Media has sole editorial control, and no advertiser has any input into the content beyond the broad topic area.\nSponsored content will be labeled in one of the following ways: \u201csponsored by our partners,\u201d \u201csponsored by,\u201d \u201cfrom our sponsor,\u201d or \u201cbrought to you by.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Co-branded content</strong>: This content is created in partnership with our sponsor and may have a sponsor logo on the page, article, video, or other content.\nThe content adheres to Healthline Media\u2019s editorial guidelines and may include products, promotions or links to an advertiser\u2019s site.\nIn some cases, a portion of the content will be created, or directed by an advertiser.\nCo-branded content will be labeled with the sponsors logo, as well as the following text: \u201cMade in partnership with BRAND NAME.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Brand pages</strong>: Healthline Media may host webpages that present content that is created by our sponsors or advertisers.\nThis content does not undergo an editorial or medical review by Healthline Media, and Healthline Media is not responsible for providing the products or services described on these pages.\nThese pages are hosted as a viewer resource, and are not meant to imply recommendations or endorsements.\nBrand pages are labeled: \u201cPaid for by.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Native advertising</strong>: Native advertising refers to links or ads that link to other content.\nThese links may direct users to other content on Healthline Media properties, or may link to an advertiser or sponsor owned page.\nThese links are displayed in the space between paragraphs of a Healthline Media article, along the right side of a content page and/or at the bottom of a page below an article or other content.\nIn cases these links direct viewers to co-sponsored content, brand pages or sponsor owned web pages, such links will be labeled with one or more of the following: \u201cSponsored,\u201d or \u201cPaid for by.\u201d</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Social media posts:</strong> Healthline Media may present advertising messages, advertisements or sponsored posts in its social media channels.\nThese advertisements will be labeled \u201c#ad\u201d and may also include \u201c#sponsored,\u201d \u201c#PartnerPromotion,\u201d or \u201c#HLsponsor.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6.\nAffiliate program (ecommerce links in Healthline Media content)</strong>\n<p>As part of the article creation process, our health and wellness editors will occasionally include links to relevant products they feel could be useful to our readers.\nWhile all products are chosen independently, we want you to know that Healthline Media may receive a payment if you make a purchase at the retailer\u2019s site within 24 hours of clicking on one of the links we provide.</p>\n<strong>7.\nWe clearly distinguish content that is part of a Partner program.</strong>\n<p>Occasionally Healthline Media will work with products, services or organizations that align with our mission.\nHealthline Media vets these products, services or organizations for quality and only presents what it feels is valuable to and in the best interest of our users.\nHealthline Media does not medically review the content and is not responsible for providing the products or services described on these pages.\nAny partner content of this type will be labeled with the following language, \u201cThe following is paid for by our sponsor.\nThe sponsor of this content has sole editorial control.\u201d In the instances where Healthline Media receives a payment when users purchase, or sign up for the product or service the page may also include this language, \u201cHealthline and our partners may receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link above.\u201d Partner pages may also include a \u201cwhat\u2019s this\u201d link that takes users to a page that explains the nature of the partnership.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>About Us</li>\n<li>Newsletters</li>\n<li>Health Topics</li>\n<li>Find an Online Doctor</li>\n<li>Contact Us</li>\n<li>Advertising
