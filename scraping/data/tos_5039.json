document has to do with your computer talking to this website, not the Handshake network itself.\nWhen you talk to the Handshake network no single authority is in charge of it (not the authors of this website), and that your actions are public in a peer-to-peer network.\nSome of the items below were left over when there was a claim form for open source developers not on github or the PGP strong set.</p>\n<p>Last Updated: 12/21/2019</p> HANDSHAKE.ORG\u2019S PRIVACY POLICY (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) <p> Handshake Development Inc.\n(\u201cHandshake,\u201d \u201cUs,\u201d or \u201cWe\u201d),

to submit information relating to the nomination and voting on behalf of yourself.\nYou consent to the publication of the non-personal information or anonymous information you provide us about your

INFORMATION </strong>\n<br> While visiting the Handshake Sites or if you are using our Services, we may collect publicly available information from you through the use of cookies, web server logs, and

information with any third-parties, unless one of the following circumstances apply: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2014 Handshake has your express consent.\nand</li>\n<li>\u2014 It is for Handshake\u2019s internal use, research and product development;</li>\n<li>\u2014 External processing by our affiliates or other trusted third parties we use to support our business based on our instructions or other

information with third parties.\nHandshake may also share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Handshake if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2014 meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>\n<li>\u2014 enforce applicable agreements or adherence to terms and conditions, including investigation of potential criminal law violations.\nand</li>\n<li>\u2014 protect against harm

will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any Personal Information and give affected users notice before Personal Information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p> Handshake shall not sell nor license your Personal Information to a third party for that third party\u2019s own direct marketing purposes.\n</p> YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES <p> TRACKING

deletion of your personal information or to request changes to the personal information associated with your account.\n</p> DATA RETENTION <p> We retain all personal information and data relating to your accounts indefinitely unless a data subject requests that their information be deleted.\n</p> CalOPPA STATEMENT <p> The State of California requires us to post specific language related to our privacy policy.\nBy default, Handshake does not share your personal information with any third parties aside from the disclosures already made in this privacy policy.\nIf you wish to inquire into how Handshake processes or collects personal information or how it shares personal information with third parties, you may contact: </p> Handshake Development, Inc.\n1459 18th St, #316 San Francisco, CA 94107<br> SECURITY <p> Handshake has implemented policies that include administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to help protect Personal Information against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nWhile Handshake strives to protect your privacy, because of multiple uncontrollable variables, including the inherent security flaws in the internet, Handshake cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose to us and, as such, you agree that your disclosure of such information is at your own risk.\n</p> LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA PROCESSING <p> Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal information is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the information subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIf our company is subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal information is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal information may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the aforementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal information.\nSuch processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nHe considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n</p> HOW WE TRANSFER INFORMATION COLLECTED INTERNATIONALLY <p> Handshake has established a global network presence and may maintain servers in many countries around the world, including the United States.\nYou agree that we may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you reside.\nYou consent to the storage of personal information collected by Handshake on a server located in the United States.\nWe will request your consent before we transfer your personal information outside of the country where the information is maintained.\n</p> COPPA DISCLOSURE - About Children\u2019s Online Privacy <p> The Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed to give parents increased control over what information is collected from their children online and how such information is used.\nThe law applies to websites and services directed to, and which knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 13.\nOur online services are not directed to children under the age of 13, nor is information knowingly collected from them.\nFor additional information on COPPA protections, please see the FTC website at: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online.\nPlease contact us at support@handshake.org if you are aware of any uses of the Service by users under the age of 13.\n</p> PUBLIC FORUMS <p> Handshake may register and make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users.\nPlease note that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.\n</p> NAME AND ADDRESS OF DATA PROTECTION OFFICER AND NAME AND ADDRESS OF

<p> Dispute Resolution.\nPlease read this Arbitration Agreement carefully.\nIt is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.\nIt contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nAll claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.\nUnless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</li>\n<li> (b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.\nBefore either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.\nA Notice to the Company should be sent to: </li> Handshake Foundation<br> 1459 18th St, #316<br> San Francisco CA 94107<br>\n<br>\n<li> After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.\nIf you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.\n</li>\n<li> (c) Arbitration Rules.\nArbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201cADR Provider\u201d) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201cArbitration Rules\u201d) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.\nIf you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.\nEach party shall bear its own costs (including attorney\u2019s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.\n</li>\n<li> (d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.\nIf non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\nThe arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n</li>\n<li> (e) Time Limits.\nIf you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.\n</li>\n<li> (f) Authority of Arbitrator.\nIf arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.\n</li>\n<li> (g) Waiver of Jury Trial.\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the
