cookies.\" They are automatically deleted after your visit.\nOther cookies remain in your device's memory until you delete them.\nThese cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p>\n<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.\nAlternatively, your

pursuant to Art.\n6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO.\nThe website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors.\nIf

may revoke your consent at any time.\nAn informal email making this request is sufficient.\nThe data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>\n<p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g.\nafter fulfilling your request).\nAny mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>\nRegistration on this website\n<p>You can register on our website

of data (customer and contract data)\n<p>We collect, process, and use personal data only insofar as it is necessary to establish, or modify legal relationships with us (master data).\nThis is done based on Art.\n6 (1) (b) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.\nWe collect, process and use your personal data when accessing our website (usage data) only to the extent required to enable you to access our service or to bill you for the same.</p>\n<p>Collected customer data shall be deleted after completion of the order or

distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted.\nData we have stored for other purposes (e.g.\nemail addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p>\n5.\nPlugins and tools\nGoogle Web Fonts\n<p>For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google.\nWhen you open a page, your browser loads the required

pursuant to Art.\n6 (1) (f) DSGVO.</p>\n<p>If your browser does not support web fonts, a standard font is used by your computer.</p>\n<p>Further information about handling user data, can be found
