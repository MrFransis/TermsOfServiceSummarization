COPYRIGHT DISPUTE POLICY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</strong>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>DOGONEWS has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act or DMCA (posted at www.lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf).\nThe address of DOGONEWS's Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (a Designated Agent) is listed at the end of this policy.</p>\n<p>It is the policy of DOGONEWS to (1) block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, users.\n(2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.\nand (3) make a good faith attempt to contact the person who submitted the affected material so that they may make a counter-notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nProcedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the DOGONEWS website or service infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</li>\n<li>Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that DOGONEWS is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</li>\n<li>Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address;</li>\n<li>A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (3) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notification is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nOnce Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is

DOGONEWS user that it has removed or disabled access to the material.\nand</li>\n<li>that repeat offenders will have the infringing material removed from the system and that DOGONEWS will terminate such users access to the service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nProcedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the DOGONEWS user believes that the material that was removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the user believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner as agent, or pursuant to the law, the user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of the user;</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>\n<li>A

number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the users address is located, or if the users address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which DOGONEWS is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, DOGONEWS may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that DOGONEWS may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.\nUnless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the user, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at DOGONEWS's discretion.</p>\n<p>Please contact the DOGONEWS

Personal Data and Your Rights under GDPR</li>\n<li>Links to Third Party Sites, Services, and Content</li>\n<li>Updates</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>Information Collection</strong>\n<p>DOGO websites generally require little or no collection of personal information and you can use the services without registering for an account or providing any personal data.\nDOGO only collects personal information when a user knowingly and voluntarily provides it to us as part of the registration process for creating a user account.</p> (i) From Account holders <p>\n<strong>iDOGO accounts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>iDOGO is a service that allows children to create avatars, create a book list, bookmark content, earn points and badges, enter giveaways and contests, and link to other users' iDOGO pages.\nDuring the iDOGO account registration, we ask for (but do not save) a user's date of birth to determine whether parental consent is required for a child to use the iDOGO service.\nWhen children under the age of 16 create an iDOGO account, we ask them to provide a parent or guardian email.\nWe use the provided parent or guardian email in order to send an email notifying the recipient that their child has created an iDOGO account.\nWe inform them of their child's username and password and provide them with a link to cancel the account if they wish to.\nWhen children the age of 16 or over create an iDOGO account, we ask them to provide their email.</p>\n<p>If a child uses a third party authentication service like Google, CLEVER or Microsoft Office365 to create an iDOGO account and if they are under the age of 16, we do not store the child\u2019s email provided from the third party authentication service, but instead we ask the child for a parent or guardian email.\nIf the child is the age of 16 or over, we fetch their email from the third party authentication service in order to pre-populate the email field on the registration page, which the child can always overwrite.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Teacher accounts</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Teacher accounts allow educators to create classroom pages, student accounts, assign content, and enter giveaways.\nTeacher accounts may only be obtained by teachers who are 18 years of age or older.\nDuring the Teacher account registration, teachers are asked to provide first and last name, email, school name and address, and the grade they teach.\nWe use the email to contact teachers about the service in the following situations: (i) request for a password reset.\n(ii) respond to a question or a concern.\nor (iii) to send email newsletters that the teacher opted-into.\nThe email newsletters offer teachers the opportunity to unsubscribe and decline further communications.</p>\n<p>If a teacher uses a third party authentication service like Google, CLEVER or Microsoft Office365 to create a Teacher account, we collect and store their first and last name, and their email from the third party authentication provider.</p>\n<p>If a teacher opts to synchronize their MS Teams, Google Classroom or CLEVER roster with their DOGO class page, we may collect and store the first and last names of the students that belong in the Google Classroom they selected.\nThis information is only available to the teacher to help him or her easily match the students\u2019 usernames with their real names.</p>\n<p>If a teacher opts to post content from their Google Drive account to their DOGO class page, we may store a link to the Google Drive file that the teacher selected.\nThe link to the file is only available to the students of the teacher\u2019s DOGO class page.</p>\n<p>If a teacher signs up for DOGOnews for Teachers PRO, which requires payment, we may collect payment information (such as credit or debit card) and pass the information to Stripe, our third party payment processor.\nAll payments are processed by Stripe and all payment information is stored by them and is not available to us.</p>\n<p>All account holders may revoke DOGO\u2019s access to their account on third party authentication services like Google, CLEVER and Microsoft Office365 at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective third party authentication service.\nUsers of third party authentication services should check their privacy settings on these services to understand and change the information sent to us through each third party authentication service.\nPlease review each third party authentication service\u2019s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our websites.</p>\n<p>Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent, exchange, or release your personal information to outside parties.</p> (ii) From All users <p>In addition to the information collected when creating accounts, we may also collect certain information automatically when users visit the DOGO websites.</p>\n<p>To provide a personalized and high-quality user experience, we use various cookies that gather and store certain technical information from your browser or device, including standard log files.\nThis technical information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, device or browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, clickstream data, operating system, and the dates and

doing so.\nLawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity, and our \u201clegitimate interests\u201d or the legitimate interest of others, as described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Purpose(s) for Processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lawful Basis for Processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 To create and maintain a user account.</p>\n<p>\u2022 To provision premium services.<br> \u2022 To provide software as a service.<br> \u2022 To provide help and support.</p>\n<p>Processing is necessary for the <strong>performance of a contract</strong> or to enter into such a contract with you.</p>\n<p>\u2022 To provide newsletters or email updates.</p>\n<p>\u2022 To enable you to watch videos.</p>\n<p>\u2022 To gather audience data and improve our website

ours.\n<strong>Please note that you have a right to object to processing of your personal data where that processing is carried on for our legitimate interest.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You have the right to object at any time.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u2022 For the prevention and detection of fraud, money laundering or other crimes or for the purpose of responding to a binding request from a

information from children under the age of 16 without prior parental consent.\nAs outlined in Information Collection from Account holders \u2013 iDOGO accounts (Section 1 - i), we may collect and store a parent\u2019s email from children under the age of 16 in order to notify the parent that his or her child signed up for an iDOGO account and to provide them with a link to cancel the account if they wish to.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may have special online promotions such as giveaways and contests on the DOGO websites that are open for iDOGO users under the age of 16.\nIn order for the child to be awarded a prize we require a written parental consent form be signed by the parent and returned to us.\nThe written parental consent form may ask for additional personal information necessary to award the prize.\nIn these situations, we may email a parent or guardian as follows: (i) to inform them that their child has entered a giveaway or contest and provide them a link to cancel their child\u2019s participation and (ii) to remind them at the conclusion of a promotion, that a written parental consent is required in order to consider their child for the promotion.\nInformation given to us in this circumstance is used only for the purpose of awarding the prize and is stored in encrypted form on our secure servers for any future promotion the child may participate in.\nThe special online promotions are only for users residing in the US, since we do not fulfill prizes to Non-US users.</p> 5.\nUse of Personal Information <p>Except as outlined in Parental Consent (Section 3) and Information Collection from Account holders \u2013 Teacher accounts (Section 1 - ii), we do not use personal information that we collect through the DOGO websites.</p> 6.\nSharing of Personal Information <p>With the exception of payment data passed to Stripe for processing payments for DOGOnews for Teachers plans, we do not sell, transfer, disclose, or share personal information we collect through the DOGO websites with third parties.\nHowever, we may disclose personal information to third parties when required by law or pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings, when otherwise necessary to protect the DOGO websites or the safety of our users or any third party, or with a parent/guardian\u2019s consent.\nIf we sell, divest or transfer our business, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction, provided the third parties have agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.\nIn such case we will provide you with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company.</p> 7.\nData retention and information security <p>Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for as long as you have an account or as is necessary to deliver our service to you.</p>\n<p>The security and confidentiality of your child\u2019s information is extremely important to us, and we take a number of steps to help safeguard any personal information that your child provides to us.\nIn particular:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe</li>\n<li>When you enter any information anywhere on DOGO websites we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS/HTTPD encryption)</li>\n<li>The database where we store personal information is encrypted at rest, which converts all personal information stored in the database to an unintelligible form</li>\n<li>We ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption and salted hashing.\nUser passwords are not visible to DOGO administrators or employees</li>\n<li>We restrict access to personal information to authorized employees only</li>\n<li>Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to files</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.</p>\n<p>If we know or have reason to know of a systems security breach by an unauthorized party of user data where that data is being or is likely to be used for an unauthorized purpose, we will promptly notify you so that you can take appropriate steps.</p> 8.\nParental Control of Personal Information <p>Upon providing proper identification, parents can review, correct, or have deleted their child\u2019s personal information from our database, or refuse further collection or use of personal information from their child by writing to us at: DOGO Media, Inc.</p>\n<p>1 Blackfield Drive #169, Tiburon, CA 94920.\nYou may also email us at privacy@dogonews.com.</p> 9.\nCalifornia Privacy Rights and Do Not Track Disclosure <p>If you are under the age of 18, or the parent of a user under the age of 18, residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted on DOGO websites.\nTo request removal of your or your child\u2019s content or information, please email us at help@dogonews.com for assistance, or you can delete specific information (or delete your or your child\u2019s account) directly.\nPlease note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be de-identified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form.\nAdditionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.</p>\n<p>Currently, various browsers offer a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d or \u201cDNT\u201d option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the user\u2019s browser DNT preference setting.\nDOGO does not track users over time and across third-party websites and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.\nFor more information on \u201cdo not track\u201d, please visit www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>\n<p>We do not share information that we collect through the DOGO websites with third parties for the third party\u2019s direct marketing purposes.</p> 10.\nInternational visitors <p>DOGO websites are operated and managed on servers located within the United States.\nIf you use DOGO websites from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that differ from U.S.\nlaw, then you acknowledge and agree that you are transferring your Personal Information outside of those regions to the United States and that, by providing your Personal Information on DOGO websites, you consent to that transfer.</p> 11.\nEU Personal Data and Your Rights under GDPR <p>DOGO is committed to providing you control over and visibility to your Personal Data.\nIf you are located in the EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") related to your Personal Data, as described below.</p>\n<p>We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, if it is not required by law, or if the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question.\nIn some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, to verify your identity and the nature of your request.\nIf you are an Account holder (iDOGO or Teacher account), you can accomplish most of the following by logging into your account.</p>\n<p>Access: You can request a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you.</p>\n<p>Rectification: If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data.</p>\n<p>Erasure: You can request that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our systems.\nNote that if you request the deletion of information required to provide the Service to you, your User Account will be deactivated and you will lose access to the Service.</p>\n<p>Portability: You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format.\nYou can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.</p>\n<p>For the following, please email us at privacy@dogonews.com:</p>\n<p>Withdrawal of Consent: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nPlease note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Service.</p>\n<p>Objection: You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes, such as for marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Restriction of Processing: You can ask us to restrict further processing of your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint about DOGO's practices with respect to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority of your country or EU Member State.</p> 12.\nLinks to Third Party Sites, Services, and Content <p>DOGO websites may contain links to other websites, online services, apps, and content that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under the control of or maintained by us.\nSuch links do not constitute an endorsement by us of those other apps, websites, the content displayed therein, or the persons or entities associated therewith.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to your interactions with those third parties,
