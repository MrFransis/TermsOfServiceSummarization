Private Limited\", \"we\", \"us\") provides cloud storage with user-controlled encryption.\nWe provide services ourselves at our website at https://ente.io, subdomains and related sites (\"website\"), using our mobile apps (\"mobile apps\"), and our application programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d).\nUsing ente, you and other users can encrypt your files and data by way of user-controlled encryption (\"UCE\") with a key derived from your \"password\" (or \"passphrase\"), upload, access, store, manage, share, communicate, download and decrypt files and other data (all of which we call \"data\" in these terms) and give access to that data to others (all together, \"services\" and each, a \"service\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>These terms are binding and apply to any use of the services, website and our mobile apps by you and anyone who you allow to access your data or our services.\nBy using our services, the website or our mobile apps, you and they irrevocably agree to these terms.\nIf you do not like these terms or don't want to be bound, you can't use our services, the website or our mobile apps.\nIn particular, OUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DISCLAIMERS BY US AND UNDERTAKINGS BY YOU, INCLUDING AN INDEMNITY FROM YOU IF YOU BREACH THESE TERMS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can change these terms at any time by providing you at least 30 days' prior notice of the change, whether via our website, via our mobile apps, by sending you an email or via any messaging service we provide.\nYour continued use after that notice means that you agree to the changed terms.\nIf you have paid for a subscription that is due to expire after that 30 day notice period and you do not wish to continue to use our services under the new terms, you may terminate your subscription before the new terms come into force.\nWe will then (but not otherwise) refund the unexpired portion of your subscription payment within 30 days and close your account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you comply with these terms, then we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to access and use our services via the website, our mobile apps and our API if applicable, in accordance with these terms and any plan you have subscribed for.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>Your data<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you allow others to access your data (e.g.\nvia any of the sharing features within ente), in addition to them accepting these terms, you are responsible for their actions and omissions while they are using our services and you agree to fully indemnify us for any claim, loss, damage, fine, costs (including our legal fees) and other liability if they breach any of these terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UCE is fundamental to our services.\nThis means that you, not us, have encrypted control of who has access to your data.\nYou should keep your password and Recovery Key safe and confidential.\nYou must not share your password with anyone else and should not release encryption keys to anyone else unless you wish them to have access to your data.\nIf you lose or misplace your password, you will lose access to your data.\nEncryption won\u2019t help though if someone has full access to your system or device.\nWe strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices).\nWe will never send you emails asking for your password.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You must maintain copies of all data stored by you on our services.\nThere could be a loss of data and we cannot guarantee that the services will be bug free.\nYou should download all data prior to termination of services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will store and process your data on our service subject to these terms and any plan you subscribe to.\nIf you choose to stop using our services, you must download your data first because we will schedule your uploaded files for deletion within the next 30 days.\nWe may still maintain minimal metadata about the now deleted files to ensure that clients who at one point had access to these files can render these deletions gracefully.\nPost account-deletion we may also maintain your email address, IP address and user agent information in a hashed form to prevent an abuse of free trials.\nIf we suspend or terminate our services to you because you have breached these terms, or someone you have given access to has breached these terms, during the term of that suspension we may, if we wish, delete your data immediately or deny you access to your data but keep it for evidential purposes.\nIn circumstances where we cease providing our services for other reasons, we will, if we consider it appropriate, it is reasonably practicable and we are not prevented by law or likely to incur any liability in doing so, give you 30 days' notice to retrieve your data.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>Your obligations<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Once you have subscribed to a plan for our services (with payment having been made via the website, or one of our mobile apps, you need to pay the

change the fees for our services (other than those you have already contracted and paid for) at any time if we give you notice.\nIn the absence of manifest error or other lawful error, you can't withhold payment or claim any set-off without getting our written agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If at any time you do not make a payment to us when you are supposed to (including on termination), we

that is not personal information.\nThe term \u201cprocessing\u201d is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).\nDrizzle Technologies Private Limited (CIN U72900KA2020PTC133651) (\"ente\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\") of Flat 301, Purvi Pride Apartments, Varthur, Bangalore, Karnataka, India, 560087 is the data controller under the GDPR of all other personal information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This Policy is divided into five sections to make it easier for you to see which provisions apply to different types of data.\nWords and phrases which are defined in our Terms of Service (\u201cToS\u201d) have the same meanings when they are used in this Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The sections of this Policy are:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>3.1 This Introduction section.</p>\n<p>3.2 The \u201cYour Files\u201d section.\nThis covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services.</p>\n<p>3.3 The \u201cAccount Data\u201d section.\nThis covers the metadata that is collected and generated by our systems when you use our services, and the information that you provide to us when you register and communicate with us.</p>\n<p>3.4 The \u201cWebsite Usage Data\u201d section.\nThis covers the data that is collected and generated by our systems when anyone browses our website.</p>\n<p>3.5 The \u201cGeneral Terms\u201d section, which applies to all our services and all types of data.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The GDPR provides rights to European users, but, as a leading privacy company, we make the GDPR protections and rights available to all our users globally in respect of their personal data wherever you may live.</li>\n</ol>Your Files<ol>\n<li>This is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our services (\u201cYour Files\u201d).\nThe following specific terms apply:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>5.1 When you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nWe also generate and store encrypted previews of images, videos and certain other types of file.</p>\n<p>5.2 All Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file/album/folder/collection keys or links that are created when you give them access.</p>\n<p>5.3 We collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services that you contract for when you agree to our ToS.</p>\n<p>5.4 Although Your Files are not personal information within our system because you have encrypted them, you should know that we store Your Files and make them available from servers in secure facilities in Europe or in countries that the European Commission has determined to have an adequate level of protection under Article 45 of the GDPR, depending where you are based.</p>\n<p>5.5 We keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but this is subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our ToS.\nYou should download Your Files prior to termination of services.</p>\n<p>5.6 If you forget your password you will lose access to all Your Files.</p>\n<p>5.7 When you delete one of Your Files it will be made inaccessible, marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our ToS.\nAfter account termination, all Your Files will be marked for deletion and removed when the next appropriate file purging process is run, subject to any retention specifically allowed under this Policy or our ToS.</p>\n<p>5.9 We may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files after your account has been suspended or terminated.\nIn particular, we may, but shall not be obliged to, keep Your Files where we consider it necessary for evidential purposes relating to a breach of our ToS or with respect to current or anticipated action by any competent enforcement authority or other third party.\nWith respect to release of Your Files to competent enforcement authorities and third parties, see our Takedown Guidance Policy.</p>\n<p>5.10 See also the General Terms section of this

you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>6.3 From time to time we may need to communicate with each other directly.\nWe will use the email address you have verified in your account.\nYou can communicate with us using the

information, data breach notifications, notification of major changes to our ToS or this Policy.</p>\n<p>6.4 Access to your account and files is by way of nominated email address and password.\nIt is

active.\nAfter account suspension or termination we may, but shall not be obliged to, retain all Account Data if enforcement action is likely or commenced under our ToS&nbsp;or Takedown Guidance Policy or for 1 month, whichever is longer.\nWhere there is no enforcement action likely or commenced and the 1 month period has expired, Account Data that identifies you will be anonymized, but where you are a contact of, have had a data shared with you by another ente user, those details will continue to be retained to allow services to continue for those other users.\nSee also the General Terms

correction of Account Data if it is considered incorrect, in accordance with the GDPR.\nThe information will be provided or updated promptly, and at least within one month, without charge unless the request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nCorrections will be promptly considered and actioned if appropriate.</p>\n<p>6.8 If we have disclosed the Account Data to any third party (such as a compliance authority), we will inform them of any correction where possible and will also inform the individuals about the third parties to whom the data has been disclosed where lawful and appropriate.</p>\n<p>6.9 See also the General Terms section of this Policy which applies to all types of data, including Account Data.</p>Website Usage Data<ol>\n<li>This is the section of this Policy

complies with our ToS, this Policy, and our Takedown Guidance Policy.\nYou are responsible for their compliance.</li>\n</ol>Your own security practices are critical<ol>\n<li>We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g.\nvia unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices).\nente will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us.\nWe cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to

security of all your data.\nIf you forget your password you will lose access to all your data.\nUsing the same password for ente as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking
