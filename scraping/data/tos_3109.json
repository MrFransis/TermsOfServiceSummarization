liability related to the alleged copyright infringement committed by third parties.\nThrough implementation and enforcement of such policies, we engage in a good faith effort to identify users or account holders who may be participating in repeated copyright infringement.\nTherefore, we will, in appropriate circumstances, ban the accounts of users who we believe, in our sole and absolute discretion, are repeat copyright infringers from uploading new content, pursuant to our voluntary compliance of laws like the DMCA and CMA.<br>\n<br>\nOur \u201c3 strikes\u201d repeat infringement policy is implemented as follows If one or more uploads occur after receipt of notice of a first infringement, uploaders are then given 2 chances to stop uploading videos or other content infringing any third party\u2019s copyrights.\nThis means that if an uploader has 3 videos deleted with a first notice he will not immediately be banned from SpankBang.\ninstead he will be given a chance to change his behavior, as this will count as 1 strike and not 3.\nEach notice in a day is treated as a single notice for purposes of repeat infringement, regardless of the number of notices contained in a given notification.\nThere would be little to no pedagogy in our repeat infringers policy if the process was to ban this user immediately.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, at our sole discretion, we may ban and delete a user after a single notice or two.\nWe run a check for repeat infringers approximately once every 24 hours.<br>\n<br>\nBy your use of our Website, you thereby acknowledge and

notice to you, provide us with a proper counter-notice that complies in every respect with the requirements set forth in Section 10 of our Terms of Use, thus permitting us to re-enable the applicable materials cited in the original notice of alleged infringement.<br>\n<br>\nEach such notice of repeated copyright infringement, as defined above on this page, for which you do not provide a valid
