and privacy <p>On the internet, every interaction with a digital product generates data.\nWhen you visit a CBC.ca or Radio-Canada.ca page, you generate data and in return, CBC/Radio-Canada sends you the information your device needs to display the requested content.</p>\n<p>The internet works based on this data exchange.\nWithout it, there would be no network and no internet.</p>\n<p>Collected data, like your IP address, is important to us because it tells us where to send the requested information.\nYour IP address is similar to your postal address.\nWhen you ask to have a letter or package delivered to your house, you have to give your mailing address, or else the sender won't know where to send it.\nIt's the same online.\nIf we don't have your IP address, we can't send you any data.</p>\n<p>back to top</p> What data do we collect? <p>We collect three main types of data:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When you interact with our products (analytical data)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Examples</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CBC/Radio-Canada products you visit (websites) or use (mobile apps)</li>\n<li>Your interactions with our products (things you click on, content you share, etc.)</li>\n<li>Written content you read</li>\n<li>Video content you watch</li>\n<li>Audio content you listen to</li>\n<li>Signing up as a member on the CBC Gem app or at gem.cbc.ca</li>\n<li>Comments you write on our products</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>When you navigate our products (analytical data)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Examples</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your geographic location \u2013 from your IP address or GPS on your mobile device \u2013 when you access our content</li>\n<li>The type of device and browser you use</li>\n<li>Your IP address, along with the data in CBC/Radio-Canada's cookies and those of its partners.</li>\n<li>The time of day when you interact with us</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>When you create an account through&nbsp;CBC Gem or sign

apps.\nThe data we collect is analyzed to develop products that match your preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytical data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Analytical data is obtained when you use our apps and our websites.\nThe data we analyze about content viewed and methods of viewing helps us better understand your preferences, so we can target your interests.</p>\n<p>The data may be used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Determine the performance of our content</li>\n<li>Analyze behaviour in order to reduce points of friction on our products</li>\n<li>Show you relevant content using our content recommendation engines</li>\n<li>Show you targeted ads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal data (CBC Gem member account)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Information that you share with us when you create a member account is used to offer you a service that is to be associated with your profile.\nIt is your data and you can update it at any time by logging into your CBC account, which is recognized across several of our sites, including cbc.ca and gem.cbc.ca.</p>\n<p>The data may be used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offer you a personalized experience</li>\n<li>Let you comment on our content</li>\n<li>Send you our newsletters</li>\n<li>Show you targeted ads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Ad targeting</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The data collected when you visit our website or click on our digital ads is used to show you future ads that match your interests.\nAd targeting is used to create larger group profiles and larger audience segments made of users across Canada that share common interests.</p>\n<p>For example, if we notice that a group of people (audience segment) has a keen interest in cars, we could show them content or ads about cars.\nWe would then be able to find out how many people in the segment saw the ad or content, without identifying them personally.</p>\n<p>Ad targeting data is anonymized to prevent a given person from being identified.\nInteractions with our products cannot be associated with any particular person.</p>\n<p>Revenue generated by more effective advertising is reinvested in our content and products.</p>\n<p>If you would prefer to see random ads instead of ads that match your interests, you can opt out by disabling the cookies for targeted advertising.</p>\n<p>back to top</p> How do we protect your data? <p>Your data is always protected.\nWe take strict measures to protect the personal data to which you give us access.\nThose measures comply with privacy laws as well as CBC/Radio-Canada standards.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data anonymization</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Analytical data that is collected is anonymized to prevent anyone from being re-identified.\nInteractions with our products cannot be linked to any particular person.</p>\n<p>Data anonymization is a type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection.\nIt is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Are our sites and connections secure?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Secure connections</em>\n</p>\n<p>CBC/Radio-Canada encrypts all communications containing personal information.\nData transmitted is encoded to guarantee it remains confidential in data exchanges between your devices and CBC/Radio-Canada's various products and services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Security audits</em>\n</p>\n<p>Data is kept in protected, monitored facilities to prevent any breach or intrusion.\nWe do regular audits to ensure that these measures are robust.</p>\n<p>back to top</p> Is data transmitted to third parties? <p>The data to which you give CBC/Radio-Canada access may be shared with&nbsp;third parties in some situations.\nWhen the data is passed on to third parties, CBC/Radio-Canada makes sure that the data transfer is secure.</p>\n<p>Data collected is not used for any purposes other than those authorized by CBC/Radio-Canada and our partners follow strict data protection rules equivalent to our own.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytical data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>CBC/Radio-Canada may use partner services to facilitate data analysis.\nIn such a case, we make sure that our partners follow strict data protection rules equivalent to our own.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your information (CBC Gem member account)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We pass on this data only in the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have asked us or given us prior consent,

data you choose to disclose, with whom, and why forms the basis of privacy and your right to it.\nIf you want access to features that deliver more local, more customizable, more relevant content, these require personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Filter Bubbles</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some search and feed algorithms contribute to Filter Bubbles.\nIf you reward clickbait, or click on content that generally agrees with your biases, those algorithms are only going to show you more of it.\nIt's in our mandate to offer diverse viewpoints, and while you might disagree with some of these views, we won't hide them from your view.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Algorithms</strong>\n</p>\n<p>CBC/Radio-Canada uses algorithms to customize your online experience without skewing the representation of particular views.\nAlgorithms haven't replaced the skilled people who edit our story line-ups and decide what you see across our sites.\nThey do generate features like our \"Most Popular in Your Region\" or \"Top Stories\" widgets.\nOur customized content experience keeps our digital platforms free from filter bubbles.</p>\n<p>back to top</p> Cookies <p>\n<strong>What are cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that's saved on your browser and stores information as you navigate the internet.\nThey were invented to count how many web browsers visited the Internet's first websites.\nFor example, a cookie may contain a unique number attributed to you.\nThis number allows us to recognize your browser without being able to establish your identity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do cookies work?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit a website that uses cookies, your web browser stores a cookie on your device.\nIf you come back, the cookie recognizes your unique identifier and you're considered a repeat visitor.\nThey become the building blocks of your browser's memory.</p>\n<p>Over time, the internet evolved and so did cookies.\nToday, they remember items in your shopping cart or your preferred settings, allowing you to log in to websites automatically or resume playing videos where you left off.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How does CBC/Radio-Canada use cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every time you interact with CBC/Radio-Canada online, you create data and we send you data.\nThis basic exchange of information is how the internet works.\nWithout it, there is no internet.</p>\n<p>Cookies can tell us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What CBC digital properties you visit (websites or apps) and how often</li>\n<li>What written, video and audio

example, saving your region allows you to see more of your local news each time you visit our site</p>\n<p>\n<em>Performance cookies</em>\n</p>\n<p>Performance cookies help us understand how our
