Amplitude Analytics.\nIt collects your country (such as The US), language (such as English), and OS platform/carrier (such as Windows or iPhone/Verizon) anonymously.\nThis data is only kept on Amplitude\u2019s servers for 90 days, then removed.\nIt does also create a cookie with your device ID and another encrypted string (and possibly other cookies).\nYou can use Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control to opt-out, as we only load the analytics with both of these disabled.\nYou can also use the \u201cdo not track\u201d button in the footer, or do <code>amplitude.getInstance().setOptOut(true);</code> in the console.\nYou can enable Do Not Track with these methods:</p> Chrome and Chromium-based browsers, like Opera and Brave Step 1: Open your settings page<br> Step 2: Turn on <strong>Send a \"Do not track\" request with your browsing traffic</strong>\n<br> Chromium Package Step 1: Open your settings page<br> Step 2: Click <strong>More</strong>\n<br> Step 3: Turn on <strong>Send a \"Do Not Track\" request with your browsing traffic</strong>\n<br> Firefox and Firefox Profiles, like Tor Browser Step 1: Open your settings page<br> Step 2: Scroll down to <strong>Send websites a \"Do Not Track\" signal that you don't want to be tracked</strong>\n<br> Step 3: Toggle <strong>Always</strong>\n<br> Microsoft Edge Step 1: Open your settings page<br> Step 2: Scroll down to <strong>Privacy</strong>\n<br> Step 3: Turn on <strong>Send \"Do Not Track\" requests</strong>\n<br> Internet Explorer Step 1: Click on the gear near the top right<br> Step 2: Hover over <strong>Safety</strong>\n<br> Step 3: Click <strong>Turn on Do Not Track requests</strong>\n<br> Other Browsers We don't have every browser here, so please look up how to turn on Do Not Track requests for your browser, or look in its settings.\nIf you can't find anything about it, try setting <code>navigator.doNotTrack</code> to <code>\"1\"</code> in its source code or flag settings.\n<p>And to turn on Global Privacy Control, go to the official website and download one of the supporting extensions or browsers.\nLike Do Not Track, you can also set <code>navigator.globalPrivacyControl</code> to <code>\"1\"</code> if none of these extensions or browsers appeal to you.</p>\n<p>As of right now, deleting your data prior to the 90-day expiration is only possible with your Amplitude ID or aDevice ID.\nIf you have it, then you can email <code>ethanmcbloxxer@protonmail.com</code> with the topic \u201cDelete my Amplitude data\u201d and the message containing your Amplitude ID or aDevice ID.\nPlease also specify whether the message contains your Amplitude ID or aDevice ID.\nIf you don\u2019t have it, you can retrieve your aDevice ID by opening the site\u2019s cookies and looking at the part of the cookie beginning with <code>amp</code> before a period.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Plus, by using the Dark Mode Toggle, we store a cookie called <code>dark</code> on your device.\nThis is to make sure that every page you go to afterward is also dark.\nThis is not deleted when you change back to light mode, but it becomes <code>false</code>
