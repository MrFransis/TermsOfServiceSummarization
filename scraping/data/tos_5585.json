allow may multiple people to join together to form an account (such as when multiple people may be able to enter a promotion as a team or jointly earn points for a loyalty program).\nIn these cases, information about you and the others associated with the same account may be shared within that group.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Otherwise with your consent.</strong> In addition to the sharing described or permitted by this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties whenever you affirmatively consent to such sharing.</p>\n<p>When we disclose data for business purposes as

site\n<p>Some of the content, advertising, and functionality on our Site may be provided by third parties that are not affiliated with us.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Certain third parties may serve advertising or keep track of which advertisements users see, how often they see those advertisements, and what users do in response to them.\nThese third parties may use cookies and similar technologies to provide these services.</li>\n<li>We may enable you to share certain materials on the Site with others through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, and those platforms may provide tools for doing so on our Site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These third parties may collect or receive certain information about your use of the Site, including by using cookies and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected across different websites and online services.</p>\n<p>One of the third parties that provides services on our Site is Google Inc.\nLike many websites, we use Google Analytics, a service that provides information about how many users visit our Site, when they visit, and how they navigate the Site once they are here.\nGoogle offers a browser add-on that enables users to opt-out of having data about their visits reported to websites by Google Analytics.\nMore information about the add-on is here.</p>\n<p>We also may use other Google Analytics tools, such as Demographics and Interest Reporting, which enables us to learn more about the characteristics and interests of the users who visit our Site, and Remarketing with Google Analytics, which enables us to provide relevant advertising on different websites and online services.\nYou can opt out of having your data used for these additional Google Analytics tools by visiting this page and opting out of ads provided by Google.</p> Security for credit card data and transaction information\n<p>We are committed to keeping your online transactions safe and secure.\nWe have put procedures in place to safeguard other information we collect from you.\nPlease note, however, that we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information you provide online.\nyou provide it at your own risk.</p> Links to other sites\n<p>Our Site may contain links to the sites of our affiliates, and to sites that are owned and operated by third parties.\nThese other sites may have their own privacy policies and are not governed by this Privacy Policy.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy practices, security protections, or the content of sites owned and operated by third parties.\nOther sites may collect and treat information collected differently, so we encourage you to carefully read and review the privacy policy for each site you visit.</p> User-generated content and public profile features\n<p>Our Site may, from time to time, contain interactive areas where Site users might submit comments or other content (including information about the user that might be displayed in the user's public profile within an online community) that may be visible to others.\nUsers should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal identifiers (e.g., name, email address, etc.) or other personal information in content submitted for posting or publication, the information can be read and used by others.\nThis may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.\nWe make no representations and undertake no obligations as to the security or use of information you voluntarily include when submitting content.</p> Share-with-a-friend tools\n<p>This Site may, from time to time, include a share-with-a-friend application that makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from our Site to friends or family by email.\nIn order to address your email message, the application may ask you to input the recipient\u2019s email address and/or similar information (including your email address).\nThis information is used by the application to address your message so that it can be properly sent.\nWe may temporarily maintain a log of this information for troubleshooting and fraud-prevention purposes.\nIn the event that we are offering you some form of referral award for encouraging an action on the part of the recipient (for example, if you are to earn a reward if the recipient chooses to register for one of our offerings after receiving the email from you), we may also retain the information as necessary to establish that the referral award was earned.</p> Do-not-track signals and similar mechanisms\n<p>Some web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates.\nThere is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.\nGeneral Mills currently does not take action in response to these signals.\nIf and when a standard is established and accepted, General Mills may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.</p> &nbsp.\nChildren's privacy\n<p>This Site is not directed to children and we will not request any information from children under 13 at this Site.\nGeneral Mills does have other sites that are geared in whole or in part to a child audience.\nOur commitment to the privacy of children is described more fully in the privacy policies of those sites.\nGeneral Mills and its affiliated companies take special care to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13.\nWe have developed our child privacy practices to comply with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (\"COPPA\") as well as the guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU).\nWe also recommend that parents monitor their children's Internet activities and learn and employ software or other tools that can help their children enjoy the fun and entertainment of an online experience without compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the Internet in a manner inconsistent with their parents\u2019 preferences.</p> United States only\n<p>This Site is intended for use by residents of the United States of America only.\nAll matters relating to this Site are governed by the laws of the United States.\nIf you are located outside of the United States and you contact us, please be advised that

that you previously provided to us at this Site.\nYou may contact us as described in the \"How to contact us and how to exercise your privacy rights\" section below in order to arrange this or to ask us to remove you from our list of email addresses to which we send email newsletters.\nAll of our email newsletters also contain an \"unsubscribe\" link that you can click through to unsubscribe from future email newsletters from that General Mills brand or group.</p>\n<p>Depending on the laws of your jurisdiction, you may also be entitled to request further transparency about our data processing practices, or access to, or deletion of, the personal information we collect about you.\nRequests should be submitted to us as described in the \"How to contact us and how to exercise your privacy rights\" section below.\nOnce we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity.\nIf you would like to use an agent to exercise your rights and that is authorized by the relevant laws, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising these rights or choices, although some of the functionality and features available on the Sites may change or no longer be available to you.\nAny difference in the Sites will be related to the value of the information that is no longer available to us or usable by us.</p> Do not \"sell\".\ncookie \"opt out\" choices\n<p>As described in detail in the \"Cookie Policy\" section of this Privacy Policy below, third parties use a variety of cookies and similar technologies (referred to collectively below as \u201ccookies\u201d for simplicity) to collect information on our Sites for the business purposes described above, including providing analytics services to us and providing advertising on our Sites and elsewhere based on users' online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices (so-called \"online behavioral advertising\" or \"targeted advertising\").\nSome commentators consider the presence of third-party cookies used for online behavioral advertising as a \"sale\" of personal information to those third parties for purposes of certain state laws.\nExcept to the extent that this third-party activity may be understood as a \"sale\" of personal information, we otherwise do not share your information in ways that would be a sale of personal information to third parties for purposes of relevant state laws.</p>\n<p>We offer you the opportunity to opt out of third-party use of cookies and similar technologies for targeted advertising by visiting the Cookie Preference Center found on each of our Sites.\nTo access the Cookie Preference Center, click on the \"Customize Cookie Settings\" link found at the bottom of each Site (near the Privacy Policy link).\nOnce in the Preference Center, you will be able to make choices about a variety of cookies, including third-party targeted advertising cookies and, where applicable, other cookies that we (or third parties) may use on that Site.\nCertain of our own Sites may also directly contain targeted advertisements.\nThese are served to you by Google.\nPlease click here if you want to restrict Google from using information it obtains through serving targeted advertisements on those Sites.</p> How to contact us and how to exercise your privacy rights\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please Contact Us.\nYou may also reach us by telephone at 1-800-248-7310 weekdays from 7:30 a.m.\n\u2013 5:30 p.m.\nCentral Time.\nIf you would like to exercise any legal rights you may have to access, delete, or otherwise address your personal information, please click here or, alternatively, you can reach us by telephone at the phone number and times listed in the previous sentence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Cookie Policy <p>We (and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality on our Site) may use cookies and other technologies to facilitate Site administration and navigation, to better understand and improve our Site, to determine and improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a rich online experience.\nWe provide more details about these technologies below.</p> Cookies\n<p>A cookie is a tiny file that is stored on your device.\nIt contains a unique identifier, as well as the address and other information about the site you are visiting.\nSome cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Site and use its features, such as accessing secured areas.\nOther cookies collect information about how visitors use the Site (for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages).\nWhen combined with information collected when you register on a website, cookies allow us to welcome you back to the site or otherwise provide enhanced, more personal features.\nCookies may also be used on our behalf by third parties managing our advertising on other websites to enable us to learn which advertisements bring visitors to our Sites and to otherwise improve or target our online advertising.</p>\n<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent.\nIf you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features on our Site.</p> Other tracking technologies\n<p>A variety of other tracking technologies, like web beacons, pixels, and tags, are also used.\nThese are small strings of code that are placed on a web page, email, or advertisement.\nWhen you access a page containing one of these technologies, you establish a communication with a web server, which collects certain information about your computer or device.\nThis information may include your IP address, browser type, operating system type, and identifiers that have been stored in cookies.\nWe (and third parties) may use these technologies to count the number of visitors to our Sites and to recognize users by accessing unique identifiers stored in cookies that we have set on their computers or devices.\nBeing able to access these identifiers enables us to provide a personalized experience on our Sites.\nWe may also include technologies like these in advertisements or in email messages to determine how these are acted on.</p>\n<p>For purposes of the balance of this \"Cookie Policy,\" we will include all of these technologies within the generic term \"cookies\".</p> Categories of cookies and your rights to opt out\n<p>As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, cookies are used for different purposes.\nSome cookies are \"set\" (delivered to your browser) by us.\nThese are called \"first party cookies.\" Others, called \"third party cookies\" are set by third parties who are given access to do so on our Site.\nWe are proud to offer you multiple ways to make choices about accepting or rejecting some of these cookies The primary way to do this is by accessing the Cookie Preference Center that we have established for each of our Sites (which you can access by clicking the \"Customize Cookie Settings\" link found in the bottom footer of each Site, near the link to the Privacy Policy).\nWithin the Cookie Preference Center, you will find descriptions of each category of cookie (similar to those immediately below), and then you will be able to choose to reject certain categories of cookies, should you wish to do so (except that you cannot choose to opt out of receiving cookies falling within the \"strictly necessary\" category, because our Site will not function properly without these).</p>\n<p>Cookies on our Sites fall into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems through the Cookie Preference Center.\nThese cookies are usually only set in response to your request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, filling in forms, and accessing secure areas of the Site.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site will not then work.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analytics Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies allow our Site to collect information about how you interact with the Site, including which pages you visit most often and if certain pages send you error messages.\nThese cookies help us improve our services.\nIf these cookies are blocked or disabled, our Site may become less functional, including the potential that some of our services may no longer be available to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functional Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nFunctional cookies allow our Site to remember information, such as your preferred language, that can be used to customize your experience on our Site.\nThese cookies also can be used to provide you with information specific to your region and may assist you in customizing our Site\u2019s appearance.\nIf these cookies are blocked or disabled, our Site may become less functional, including the potential that some of our services may no longer be available to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Targeting Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nTargeting cookies are used by parties that are involved in serving other companies' advertising on our sites, or that are involved in determining which of our advertisements (or other parties' advertisements) to show you on third-party websites.\nThese cookies collect information about your online activities, such as the advertisements you have seen or the websites or pages you have visited, in order to draw inferences about what advertising might be relevant to you.\nThis information is then used to show you targeted advertising (sometimes referred to as \"interest based advertising\" or \"online behavioral advertising\") that may be most relevant to you, including when you visit other websites not belonging to us.\nIf these cookies are blocked or disabled, our Site may become less functional, including the potential that some of our services may no longer be available to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With respect to this final category of cookies described above (targeting cookies), we offer a second means of opting out of these cookies \u2013 beyond our Cookie Preference Center.\nThe Cookie Preference Center relates to the cookies that are set on our Site but does not affect the rest of the online world.\nThere is also an industry-wide opt out program for targeting cookies that you can access by clicking here.\nThrough this latter program, you can opt out of receiving targeting cookies from a broad array of third parties on any site, not just ours.\nPlease be aware, though, that this opt-out process is itself cookie-based.\nIn other words, if you opt out, a cookie is placed on your browser that informs these third parties that they are not to use cookies with you for targeted advertising.\nAs a result, if you subsequently clear cookies from your browser (as many people do periodically), your opt out will be lost until you reinstate it.</p> \u00a9 2021 General Mills Inc.\nAll Rights

address, etc.) or other personal information in content submitted for posting or publication, the information can be read and used by others.\nThis may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.\nWe make no representations and undertake no obligations as to the security or use of information you voluntarily include when submitting content.</p> Share-with-a-friend tools\n<p>This Site may, from time to time, include a share-with-a-friend application that makes it easy for you to forward information or materials from our Site to friends or family by email.\nIn order to address your email message, the application may ask you to input the recipient\u2019s email address and/or similar information (including your email address).\nThis information is used by the application to address your message so that it can be properly sent.\nWe may temporarily maintain a log of this information for troubleshooting and fraud-prevention purposes.\nIn the event that we are offering you some form of referral award for encouraging an action on the part of the recipient (for example, if you are to earn a reward if the recipient chooses to register for one of our offerings after receiving the email from you), we may also retain the information as necessary to establish that the referral award was earned.</p> Do-not-track signals and similar mechanisms\n<p>Some web browsers may transmit \"do-not-track\" signals to the websites and other online services with which a user communicates.\nThere is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.\nGeneral Mills currently does not take action in response to these signals.\nIf and when a standard is established and accepted, General Mills may revisit its policy on responding to these signals.</p> &nbsp.\nChildren's privacy\n<p>This Site is not directed to children and we will not request any information from children under 13 at this Site.\nGeneral Mills does have other sites that are geared in whole or in part to a child audience.\nOur commitment to the privacy of children is described more fully in the privacy policies of those sites.\nGeneral Mills and its affiliated companies take special care to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13.\nWe have developed our child privacy practices to comply with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (\"COPPA\") as well as the guidelines established by the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU).\nWe also recommend that parents monitor their children's Internet activities and learn and employ software or other tools that can help their children enjoy the fun and entertainment of an online experience without compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the Internet in a manner inconsistent with their parents\u2019 preferences.</p> United States only\n<p>This Site is intended for use by residents of the United States of America only.\nAll matters relating to this Site are governed by the laws of the United States.\nIf you are located outside of the United States and you contact us, please be advised that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States and that by submitting information you explicitly authorize this transfer and the processing of this information within the United States.</p> Changes to our privacy policy\n<p>We may change or replace this Privacy Policy at our sole discretion at any time.\nPlease check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any updates or changes in this Privacy Policy.\nUnless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information collected by or through any Site that displays an authorized link to this Privacy Policy.</p> YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION.\nEXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES\nYour control over your information\n<p>You always have the right to review and update the information that you previously provided to us at this Site.\nYou may contact us as described in the \"How to contact us and how to exercise your privacy rights\" section below in order to arrange this or to ask us to remove you from our list of email addresses to which we send email newsletters.\nAll of our email newsletters also contain an \"unsubscribe\" link that you can click through to unsubscribe from future email newsletters from that General Mills brand or group.</p>\n<p>Depending on the laws of your jurisdiction, you may also be entitled to request further transparency about our data processing practices, or access to, or deletion of, the personal information we collect about you.\nRequests should be submitted to us as described in the \"How to contact us and how to exercise your privacy rights\" section below.\nOnce we receive your request, we may verify it by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity.\nIf you would like to use an agent to exercise your rights and that is authorized by the relevant laws, we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.\nWe will not discriminate against you for exercising these rights or choices, although some of the functionality and features available on the Sites may change or no longer be available to you.\nAny difference in the Sites will be related to the value of the information that is no longer available to us or usable by us.</p> Do not \"sell\".\ncookie \"opt out\" choices\n<p>As described in detail in the \"Cookie Policy\" section of this Privacy Policy below, third parties use a variety of cookies and similar technologies (referred to collectively below as \u201ccookies\u201d for simplicity) to collect information on our Sites for the business purposes described above, including providing analytics services to us and providing advertising on our Sites and elsewhere based on users' online activities over time and across different sites, services, and devices (so-called \"online behavioral advertising\" or \"targeted advertising\").\nSome commentators consider the presence of third-party cookies used for online behavioral advertising as a \"sale\" of personal information to those third parties for purposes of certain state laws.\nExcept to the extent that this third-party activity may be understood as a \"sale\" of personal information, we otherwise do not share your information in ways that would be a sale of personal information to third parties for purposes of relevant state laws.</p>\n<p>We offer you the opportunity to opt out of third-party use of cookies and similar technologies for targeted advertising by visiting the Cookie Preference Center found on each of our Sites.\nTo access the Cookie Preference Center, click on the \"Customize Cookie Settings\" link found at the bottom of each Site (near the Privacy Policy link).\nOnce in the Preference Center, you will be able to make choices about a variety of cookies, including third-party targeted advertising cookies and, where applicable, other cookies that we (or third parties) may use on that Site.\nCertain of our own Sites may also directly contain targeted advertisements.\nThese are served to you by Google.\nPlease click here if you want to restrict Google from using information it obtains through serving targeted advertisements on those Sites.</p> How to contact us and how to exercise your privacy rights\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please Contact Us.\nYou may also reach us by telephone at 1-800-248-7310 weekdays from 7:30 a.m.\n\u2013 5:30 p.m.\nCentral Time.\nIf you would like to exercise any legal rights you may have to access, delete, or otherwise address your personal information, please click here or, alternatively, you can reach us by telephone at the phone number and times listed in the previous sentence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Cookie Policy <p>We (and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality on our Site) may use cookies and other technologies to facilitate Site administration and navigation, to better understand and improve our Site, to determine and improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a rich online experience.\nWe provide more details about these technologies below.</p> Cookies\n<p>A cookie is a tiny file that is stored on your device.\nIt contains a unique identifier, as well as the address and other information about the site you are visiting.\nSome cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Site and use its features, such as accessing secured areas.\nOther cookies collect information about how visitors use the Site (for instance, which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages).\nWhen combined with information collected when you register on a website, cookies allow us to welcome you back to the site or otherwise provide enhanced, more personal features.\nCookies may also be used on our behalf by third parties managing our advertising on other websites to enable us to learn which advertisements bring visitors to our Sites and to otherwise improve or target our online advertising.</p>\n<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent.\nIf you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.\nPlease note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features on our Site.</p> Other tracking technologies\n<p>A variety of other tracking technologies, like web beacons, pixels, and tags, are also used.\nThese are small strings of code that are placed on a web page, email, or advertisement.\nWhen you access a page containing one of these technologies, you establish a communication with a web server, which collects certain information about your computer or device.\nThis information may include your IP address, browser type, operating system type, and identifiers that have been stored in cookies.\nWe (and third parties) may use these technologies to count the number of visitors to our Sites and to recognize users by accessing unique identifiers stored in cookies that we have set on their computers or devices.\nBeing able to access these identifiers enables us to provide a personalized experience on our Sites.\nWe may also include technologies like these in advertisements or in email messages to determine how these are acted on.</p>\n<p>For purposes of the balance of this \"Cookie Policy,\" we will include all of these technologies within the generic term \"cookies\".</p> Categories of cookies and your rights to opt out\n<p>As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, cookies are used for different purposes.\nSome cookies are \"set\" (delivered to your browser) by us.\nThese are called \"first party cookies.\" Others, called \"third party cookies\" are set by third parties who are given access to do so on our Site.\nWe are proud to offer you multiple ways to make choices about accepting or rejecting some of these cookies The primary way to do this is by accessing the Cookie Preference Center that we have established for each of our Sites (which you can access by clicking the \"Customize Cookie Settings\" link found in the bottom footer of each Site, near the link to the Privacy Policy).\nWithin the Cookie Preference Center, you will find descriptions of each category of cookie (similar to those immediately below), and then you will be able to choose to reject certain categories of cookies, should you wish to do so (except that you cannot choose to opt out of receiving cookies falling within the \"strictly necessary\" category, because our Site will not function properly without these).</p>\n<p>Cookies on our Sites fall into the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems through the Cookie Preference Center.\nThese cookies are usually only set in response to your request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, filling in forms, and accessing secure areas of the Site.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Site will not then work.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analytics Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nThese cookies allow our Site to collect information about how you interact with the Site, including which pages you visit most often and if certain pages send you error messages.\nThese cookies help us improve our services.\nIf these cookies are blocked or disabled, our Site may become less functional, including the potential that some of our services may no longer be available to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functional Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nFunctional cookies allow our Site to remember information, such as your preferred language, that can be used to customize your experience on our Site.\nThese cookies also can be used to provide you with information specific to your region and may assist you in customizing our Site\u2019s appearance.\nIf these cookies are blocked or disabled, our Site may become less functional, including the potential that some of our services may no longer be available to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Targeting Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nTargeting cookies are used by parties that are involved in serving other companies' advertising on our sites, or that are involved in determining which of our advertisements (or other parties' advertisements) to show you on third-party websites.\nThese cookies collect information about your online activities, such as the advertisements you have seen or the websites or pages you have visited, in order to draw inferences about what advertising might be relevant to you.\nThis information is then used to show you targeted advertising (sometimes referred to as \"interest based advertising\" or \"online behavioral advertising\") that may be most relevant to you, including when you visit other websites not belonging to us.\nIf these cookies are blocked or disabled, our Site may become less functional, including the potential that some of our services may no longer be available to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With respect to this final category of cookies described above (targeting cookies), we offer a second means of opting out of these cookies \u2013 beyond our Cookie Preference Center.\nThe Cookie Preference Center relates to the cookies that are set on our Site but does not affect the rest of the online world.\nThere is also an industry-wide opt out program for targeting cookies that you can access by clicking here.\nThrough this latter program, you can opt out of receiving targeting cookies from a broad array of third parties on any site, not just ours.\nPlease be aware, though, that this opt-out process is itself cookie-based.\nIn other words, if you opt out, a cookie is placed on your browser that informs these third parties that they are not to use cookies with you for targeted advertising.\nAs a result, if you subsequently clear cookies from your browser (as many people do periodically), your opt out will be lost until you reinstate it.</p> \u00a9 2021 General Mills Inc.\nAll Rights
