routing, and image delivery.\nThe Services described under the \u201cAPI Services\u201d paragraph, do not involve image hosting or storage except for the limited caching described below.\nHowever, the Services do provide certain hosted processing and rendering services (\u201cHosted Services\u201d) as further described in the \u201cHosted Services\u201d paragraph below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>API Services.</strong> The Services imgix offers via its web API (\u201cAPI Services\u201d) enable you to control the actions imgix takes with respect to your images without uploading the images to the Services.\nTo use the API Services, you must connect your image hosting or storage location to the API Services.\nYou are responsible for updating your site or service's code to work with the API Services.\nThe API Services provide limited caching and rendering services that imgix uses during the course of providing the Services to you.\nIf an image cached via the API Services is removed from your storage or hosting location, it may remain on imgix's caching servers for a limited time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Hosted Services.</strong> imgix may make certain Hosted Services available, which may enable users to upload images, use hosted processing features and functionality, and deliver or route such images.\nYou may use the Hosted Services only for Sandbox.\nWithout limiting the foregoing or any other terms of these Terms, you may not use the Hosted Services to serve image traffic other than for testing purposes.\nNotwithstanding Section 12 (Change to the Services) below, imgix reserves the right to modify, discontinue or suspend access to the Hosted Services at any time for any reason, without notice or obligation to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Content Delivery.</strong> imgix can be accessed for content delivery of your User Content (as defined below).\nWhen you access imgix for content delivery, imgix may cache your User Content for performance reasons.\nWhen cached User Content is accessed, you will be charged only for bandwidth out of imgix.\nAccessing User Content that has not been cached will trigger a render on imgix, which incurs additional charges.\nAlthough imgix does not guarantee that any User Content will be cached, imgix will strive to cache your User Content for at least the lesser of (a) the amount of time you indicate you would like your User Content cached or (b) 30 days (the \"<b>Cache Period</b>\").\nimgix will not charge you to render User Content during the Cache Period, even if the User Content has been removed from cache.\nimgix may cache User Content for longer than the Cache Period.\nIf you do not use imgix for content delivery, then imgix will not cache your User Content, and every request to access such User Content will incur rendering charges.\nFor purposes of the above, User Content hosted via the Hosted Services will be treated as though it has been cached by imgix.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>URL.</strong> imgix will provide you with a custom domain name that you may select for your imgix User Content (as defined below).\nYou will have the opportunity to select an alternative domain name at any time.\nimgix does not guarantee the availability of any domain name.\nimgix reserves the right to change your domain name with 14 days' advance notice to you.\nIf you do not change your domain name before the 14-day notice period expires, imgix will select an alternative domain name for you.</p> 4.\nFEES AND PAYMENTS <p>Pricing for the Services is located at https://www.imgix.com/pricing.\nimgix's Payment Policy, as set forth

Francisco County, California, will have exclusive jurisdiction over any suit in connection with the Services or these Terms that is not subject to arbitration, and you and imgix hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.\nThese Terms and your access to or use of the Services will be governed by, construed in accordance with, and enforced under the laws of the State of California without resort to its conflict of law provisions.</p> 18.\nAMENDMENT <p>imgix reserves the right to make changes or modifications to these Terms from time to time, in its sole discretion.\nIf imgix makes changes to these Terms, imgix will provide you with notice of such changes, such as by sending you an email or by posting the amended Terms via the Services and updating the \"Last Updated\" date at the top of these Terms.\nAll amended Terms will become effective immediately on the date they are posted to the Services unless imgix states otherwise in its notice regarding the amended Terms.\nAny amended Terms will apply prospectively to use of the Services after such changes become effective.\nYour continued use of the Services following the effective date of such changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes.\nIf you do not agree to any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.</p> 19.\nMISCELLANEOUS <p>These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Services.\nThese Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic or written agreement you may have with imgix for the Services or for any other imgix product or service or otherwise.\nIn the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with imgix, the terms of that other agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement.\nNothing in these Terms creates or can be construed to create an employer/employee, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and imgix.\nExcept as otherwise expressly elsewhere in these Terms, there will be no third party beneficiaries to these Terms.\nimgix's failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof.\nIf any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\nimgix will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any event beyond imgix's reasonable control, including, but not limited to, flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction.\nHeadings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections.\nAs used in these Terms, \"including\" means \"including (without limitation).\" You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written consent from imgix.\nimgix may assign or transfer any or all of its rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your consent or approval.</p> 20.\nQUESTIONS <p>If you have any questions regarding the use of the Services, please email imgix at support@imgix.com.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-01-01 20:17:49.808343", "updated_at":
