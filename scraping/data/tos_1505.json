products, generate leads for us, and perform fundraising activities.\nWe receive information from these partners, such as billing information, billing and technical contact information, company name, what Cornell Lab products you have purchased or may be interested in, evaluation information you have provided, what events you have attended, and what country you are in.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other partners:</strong>&nbsp;We receive information about you and your activities on and off the Services from third-party partners, such as advertising, philanthropy, and market research partners who provide us with information about your interest in and engagement with, our Services and online advertisements.</p>\nHow we use information we collect\n<p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have communicated to us.\nBelow are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect about you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide the Services and personalize your experience:</strong>&nbsp;We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services.\nOur Services also include tailored features that personalize your experience, enhance your enjoyment of birds by automatically analyzing your activities on our Services to provide search results, activity feeds, notifications, connections and recommendations that are most relevant for you.\nWhere you use multiple Services, we combine information about you and your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow you to find information from one Service while searching from another or to present relevant Services information as you travel across our websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For Service research and development:</strong>&nbsp;We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, faster, secure, integrated, and useful to you.\nWe use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the Services.\nIn some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use.\nWe also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To conduct scientific research:</strong>&nbsp;Our citizen-science projects are designed to benefit the entire scientific research community.\nIt\u2019s critical for the analyzed data to be available to the researchers for use, modification, and redistribution in order to further scientific research.\nTherefore, if you participate in any Cornell Lab citizen-science projects, you grant permission to the Cornell Lab and its collaborators to use your contributions in any wayto further this goal.\nWe will do our best us to protect your data and your privacy to the extent that does not impede scientific research.\nThe license to use your data is non-exclusive to us.\nYou may still contribute the same data to other organizations.</p>\n<p>We ask you to grant us these broad permissions for use, because they allow us to change the legal details by which we keep the data available.\nthis is important because the legal environment can change and we need to be able to respond without obtaining permission from every single contributor.</p>\n<p>Finally, you must not contribute data to the Cornell Lab that you do not own.\nFor example, do not submit photos from Flickr or other third party services if you do not hold copyright for those photos..</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For philanthropy, development, and stewardship:</strong>&nbsp;As is customary for non-profit organizations, we may send requests to support the Lab to people who have expressed an interest in our Services.\n.You can easily opt-out of these communications by clicking the \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 link at the bottom of any fundraising e-mail you receive.</p>\n<p>As a donor of the Cornell Lab, your generosity makes our mission possible.\n&nbsp;We do not rent or sell your Personal Information but we do share names and postal addresses with other nonprofit organizations.\n&nbsp;Sharing this information with other reputable charitable organizations is the most cost effective way to find new supporters, share program offerings, and identify new donors.\n&nbsp;If you would prefer that your information not be shared with other organizations contact the Membership Office by phone at 866-989-2473 or email&nbsp;clomembership@cornell.edu</p>\n<p>We do not rent or exchange your e-mail address or phone number.</p>\n<p>We may use your information to enhance your experience with us and enable relevant communications with you.\nFor example, we may use your data to manage your donation or membership and keep a record of your relationship with us.\nWe may use your information and analyze our database to understand and steward our donors and users, their preferences, and their level of potential donations, to improve our services, products, and communications, including messages, advertisements, fundraising appeals, events, and meetings we think will interest you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To communicate with you about the Services:</strong>&nbsp;We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.\nWe also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.\nWe also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.\nThese communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them.\nIf an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To market, promote, and drive engagement with the Services:</strong>&nbsp;We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Cornell Lab of Ornithology ads on other companies\u2019 websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google.\nThese communications are

place.\nWhere we are using your information because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, this may mean no longer using the Services.</p>\nHow we

providers:</strong>&nbsp;We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.\nIf a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Partners:</strong>&nbsp;We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, and technical services to deliver and implement user solutions around the Services.\nWe may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such

party or hosted directly on our Services.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With your consent:</strong>&nbsp;We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.\nFor example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied participants and supporters on our public websites.\nWith your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance with enforcement requests and applicable laws.\nenforcement of our rights:</strong>&nbsp;In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
