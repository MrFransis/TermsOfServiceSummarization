agree to be bound by these terms and conditions (Terms).\n&nbsp;These Terms apply to each Streamotion Service you subscribe to and your use of, and access to, a Streamotion Service indicates your acceptance of these Terms (and any changes to them).<br>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Changes</b>\n<br>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThese Terms and any Subscription Fee are subject to change by

regularly and may change from time to time.\nWhere we make a material change to the Streamotion Service which has a detrimental impact, we will provide you with 21 days\u2019 notice prior to making that change where reasonably practicable.\nA change for which we will endeavour to provide you notice under this clause 4 includes removing a channel without providing a similar replacement channel or reducing the price you pay.\nIf it has a detrimental impact to you, you may cancel your subscription to the Streamotion Service in accordance with clause 33 below.<br>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Accessing a Streamotion Service</b>\n<br>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nTo join a Streamotion Service you must be at least 18 years old and you must register or hold a Streamotion account.&nbsp.\nYou
