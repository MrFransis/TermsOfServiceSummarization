make available to a third-party Customer Personal Data except to provide the Services or as expressly permitted by this Agreement.&nbsp.\nFor purposes of this paragraph, \u201csell\u201d shall have the meaning set forth in the CCPA.</p>\n<p>3.\nSECURITY.\nPRIVACY IMPACT ASSESSMENTS.</p>\n<p>3.1.\nLucid Personnel.\nLucid will ensure that its personnel engaged in the processing of Customer Personal Data are informed of the confidential nature of the Customer Personal Data and are subject to obligations of confidentiality and such obligations survive the termination of that individual\u2019s engagement with Lucid.</p>\n<p>3.2.\nSecurity.\nLucid will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard Customer Personal Data taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.</p>\n<p>3.3 Data Privacy Impact Assessments.\nLucid will take reasonable measures to cooperate and assist Customer in conducting a data protection impact assessment and related consultations with any supervisory authority, if Customer is required to do so under Data Protection Legislation.</p>\n<p>4.\nDATA SUBJECT RIGHTS.</p>\n<p>4.1.\nAssistance with Customer\u2019s Obligations.\nLucid

to process Customer Personal Data, Lucid will, at least ten (10) days before the new subprocessor processes any Customer Personal Data, notify Customer by updating its list of subprocessors located at&nbsp;https://www.lucid.co/eu-personal-data-sub-processor-list and give Customer the opportunity to object to such subprocessor.</p>\n<p>5.3.\nLucid Obligations.\nLucid will remain liable for the acts and omissions of its subprocessors to the same extent Lucid would be liable if performing the services of each subprocessor directly under the terms of this DPA.\nLucid will contractually impose data protection obligations on its subprocessors that are at least equivalent to those data protection obligations imposed on Lucid under this DPA.</p>\n<p>6.\nDATA TRANSFERS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6.1.\nGoverning Terms.\nFor transfers of Customer Personal Data under this DPA from the EEA to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection within the meaning of the Data Protection Legislation, to the extent such transfers are subject to the Data Protection Legislation, the parties will transfer Customer Personal Data internationally only pursuant to a transfer mechanism valid under Data Protection Legislation or applicable law, i.e.\na valid mechanism in the exporting country&nbsp;(such as the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework) which is approved by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of protection.\nLucid has certified compliance with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework.\nIf the transfer mechanism authorizing the transfer of Customer Personal Data from one country to another country as contemplated in this Section is no longer applicable to Lucid, then immediately upon its expiration, Customer and Lucid will enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses, incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp.\nFor purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, (a) Customer, the party transferring from the EEA or Switzerland, will be referred to as the \u201cData Exporter\u201d.\nand (b) Lucid will be referred to as the \u201cData Importer.\u201d Annex A to this DPA shall apply as Appendix 1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nAnnex B to this DPA shall apply as Appendix 2 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>7.\nSECURITY BREACH.</p>\n<p>7.1.\nNotification Obligations.\nIn the event Lucid becomes aware of any Security Breach, Lucid will notify Customer of the Security Breach without undue delay.\nThe obligations in this Section&nbsp;7 do not apply to incidents that are caused by Customer or Customer's personnel or&nbsp;Users or to unsuccessful attempts or activities that do not compromise the security of Customer Personal Data, including unsuccessful log-in attempts, pings, port scans, denial of service attacks, and other network attacks on firewalls or networked systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7.2.\nManner of Notification.\nNotification(s) of Security Breaches, if any, will be delivered to one or more of Customer\u2019s business, technical or administrative contacts by any means Lucid selects, including via email.\nIt is Customer\u2019s sole responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information on Lucid\u2019s systems at all times.&nbsp.\nFurthermore, it is Customer\u2019s sole responsibility to notify the relevant data protection supervisory authority and, when applicable, the Data Subjects of a Security Breach as required under the Article 33 and 34 of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>8.\nTERM AND TERMINATION.</p>\n<p>8.1.\nTerm of DPA.\nThis DPA will remain in effect until, and automatically expire upon, deletion of all Customer Personal Data as described in this DPA.</p>\n<p>8.2.\nDeletion of Customer Data.\nLucid shall retain Customer Personal Data in its possession until 30 days following the earlier of: (a) written confirmation from Customer that Lucid may delete Customer\u2019s account and all User accounts.\nor (b) the date that Customer and all Users delete their accounts.\nPrior to deletion, Lucid will make any Customer Personal Data in its possession available for download by Customer.\nLucid shall have no obligation to retain any portion of Customer Personal Data after such period except to the extent that Lucid is required under Data Protection Legislation to keep a copy of the Customer Personal Data.</p>\n<p>9.\nAUDITS.</p>\n<p>9.1.\nAudit Rights.\nUpon Customer\u2019s written request no more than once per year, Lucid will provide a copy of its then most recent third-party audits or certifications, as applicable, or any summaries thereof, in order that Customer may reasonably verify Lucid\u2019s compliance with the technical and organizational measures as required under this DPA.\nAudit requests must be sent via certified mail to 10355 South Jordan Gateway, Suite 300, South Jordan, UT, USA 84095, ATTN: Legal.&nbsp.\nTo the extent Customer and this DPA are subject to the GDPR, Lucid will allow Customer or a mutually agreed upon independent auditor appointed by Customer to conduct an audit (including inspection) at Customer\u2019s sole cost and expense, no more than once per year upon eight weeks\u2019 notice sent to the above address complete with a detailed audit plan describing the proposed scope, duration, and start date of the audit.\nLucid will contribute to such audits whose sole purpose will be to verify Lucid\u2019s compliance with its obligations under this DPA.\nThe auditor must execute a written confidentiality agreement acceptable to Lucid before conducting the audit.\nThe audit must be conducted during regular business hours, subject to Lucid\u2019s policies, and may not unreasonably interfere with Lucid\u2019s business activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.2.\nSeparate Service.\nAny request for Lucid to provide assistance with an audit is considered a separate service if such audit assistance requires the use of resources different from or in addition to those required by law.\nCustomer shall reimburse Lucid for any time spent for any such audit at rates mutually agreed to by the parties, taking into account the resources expended by Lucid.\nCustomer shall promptly notify Lucid with information regarding any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.3 Limits on Auditing Party.\nNothing in this DPA will require Lucid either to disclose to an independent auditor or Customer, or to allow an independent auditor or Customer to access: (a) any data of any other customer of Lucid.\n(b) Lucid's internal accounting or financial information.\n(c) any trade secret of Lucid.\n(d) any premises or equipment not controlled by Lucid.\nor (e) any information that, in Lucid's reasonable opinion, could: (i) compromise the security of Lucid\u2019s systems or premises.\n(ii) cause Lucid to breach its obligations under Data Protection Legislation or the rights of any third-party.\nor (iii) any information that an independent auditor seeks to access for any reason other than the good faith fulfillment of Customer's obligations under the Data Protection Legislation.\nCustomer shall contractually impose, and designate Lucid as a third-party beneficiary of, any contractual terms that prohibit any independent auditor from disclosing the existence, nature, or results of any audit to any party other than Customer unless such disclosure is required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>ANNEX A</p>\n<p>APPENDIX 1 TO THE STANDARD CONTRACTUAL

these Terms and the Services and Websites provided by Lucid are subject to binding arbitration and a waiver of class action rights detailed in Section 20 below.</p>\n<p>Lucid Software Inc.\n(\u201cLucid,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d) offers productivity, collaboration and data visualization tools available online, including via a mobile application, as subscription services (each, a \u201cSubscription Service\u201d) as well as support and professional services (all collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d), and websites, including but not limited to www.lucidchart.com, www.lucidspark.com, www.lucidpress.com, lucid.co, lucidchart.zendesk.com, lucidpress.zendesk.com, lucidco.zendesk.com, lucidspark.zendesk.com, lucidspark.com/blog, lucidchart.com/blog and lucidpress.com/blog (collectively, the \u201cWebsites\u201d).</p>1.\nYour relationship with Lucid&nbsp;<p>1.1 Lucid has three different types of end users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We call users of the Websites \u201cSite Visitors.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We call users who use the free version of the Services \u201cFree Users.\u201d While Free Users can access and use the Services, they have access to a more limited set of features and functionality than Subscribers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We call users who use the Services as part of a paid subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) \u201cSubscribers.\u201d The features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We refer to these three types of end users collectively as \u201cUsers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d for purposes of these Terms of Service (the \u201cTerms\u201d).\nRegardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legally binding agreement between you and Lucid and explain the rules governing use of the Services and Websites.\nIf you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Services and Websites.</p>2.\nAccepting the Terms<p>2.1 You acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms and our&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;by clicking or tapping on a button indicating your acceptance, by accessing or using the Services and Websites, or by executing or making payment based on an ordering document, statement of work or invoice (an \u201cOrder\u201d) that references these Terms.</p>\n<p>2.2 By accepting these Terms, you represent that you have the legal power to do so.\nIf you accept these Terms on behalf of an organization, (a) \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer to that organization and any individual accessing the Services through your account will be referred to as a \u201cUser\u201d.\nand (b) you understand and agree that the organization will be responsible for ensuring that each of its Users complies with these Terms.</p>\n<p>2.3 You may not use the Services and may not accept the Terms if you are barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are a resident or from which you use the Services.&nbsp.\nIf you represent an organization, you will ensure that: (a) your Users do not use the Services in violation of any export restriction or embargo by the United States.\nand (b) you do not provide access to the Services to persons or entities on any restricted lists.</p>\n<p>2.4 If you are under 18 years old, you may not create a Lucid account or use the Services unless (a)

person under 18 years of age (a \u201cMinor\u201d) to create an account and/or use the Services, you agree to: (i) supervise the Minor\u2019s use of the Services and their account.\n(ii) assume all risks associated with, and liabilities resulting from, the Minor\u2019s use of the Services and their account.\n(iii) ensure that the content in the Services and on the Websites are suitable for the Minor.\n(iv) ensure all information submitted to us by the Minor is accurate.\nand (v) provide the consents, representations and warranties contained in the Terms on the Minor\u2019s behalf.</p>3.\nProvision of the Services by Lucid<p>3.1 You and each User may access and use the Services, including the software provided as part of the Services, during the applicable subscription term, solely in connection with your internal business operations and subject to these Terms.&nbsp.\nYou may not assign or grant a sub-license of your rights to use the Services, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the Services, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Services.</p>\n<p>3.2 Lucid may provide implementation, consulting, configuration, integration, training, advisory, development, and other professional services (\u201cProfessional Services\u201d) as described in, and subject to payment of the fees specified in, an Order.\nAny

other deliverables identified in an Order for Professional Services (\u201cDeliverables\u201d) for your internal business purposes, pursuant to these Terms.</p>\n<p>3.3 Lucid provides technical support for the Subscription Service (\u201cSupport\u201d) through its online helpcenter available at lucidchart.Zendesk.com, lucidpress.zendesk.com, lucidco.zendesk.com and lucidspark.zendesk.com, as applicable.\nSupport requests may be submitted to support@lucidchart.com, support@lucidspark.com&nbsp;or support@lucidpress.com, as applicable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.4 If you choose a trial subscription, during the trial period the Subscription Service is provided \u201cAS-IS\u201d (with no warranties).\nLucid will not be liable for any damages related to your use of the Subscription Service during the trial period.\nOnce the trial period ends, your credit card will be charged for the subscription plan that you had chosen unless you cancel the trial in product before the trial ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.5 Lucid warrants that: (a) during the applicable subscription term, the Subscription Service will operate substantially as described in the online documentation.\n(b) the Support and Professional Services will be performed in a competent and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally accepted industry standards, this Agreement and applicable Order.\nand (c) the Deliverables will conform to the specifications in the applicable Order.\nIf you believe a Service or Deliverable does not comply with these warranties, you must notify Lucid in writing within 30 days of delivery of the non-conforming Service or Deliverable.\nAs your exclusive remedy and Lucid\u2019s sole liability for breach of these warranties, Lucid will use commercially reasonable efforts to

modification to the applicable Service or Deliverable caused or made by you, any User, or a person acting at your direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.6 The Subscription Service includes the features and functionality applicable to the version selected.\nLucid may update the content, functionality, and user interface of the Subscription Service in its sole discretion.\nSome features and functionality may be available only with certain versions of the Subscription Service.&nbsp.\nLucid does not represent or warrant that a particular subscription plan will be offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change or alter the features and options, including volume of transmissions and maximum storage space, in a particular subscription plan without prior notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>4.\nUsing the Services<p>4.1 In order to register for and access certain Services, you and each User will be required to provide information.\nYou agree that any registration information given to Lucid, including contact information (e.g., e-mail address) and billing/payment details, will be accurate and kept current.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.2 You will obtain, maintain, and support all internet access, equipment, and ancillary services needed to access the Services and Deliverables.\nSubscriptions are for named individuals and cannot be shared or used by more than one individual at a time.\nEach User must keep a secure password for accessing the Subscription Service, which must be kept confidential.\nYou will (a) if applicable, obtain from the Users on your account any consents necessary for Lucid to provide the Services.\n(b) maintain commercially reasonable security standards with respect to use of the Lucid Assets (defined below).\nand (c) in the event of any unauthorized access to or use of the Services or Deliverables, promptly notify Lucid at&nbsp;support@lucidchart.com&nbsp;or&nbsp;support@lucidpress.com, as applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.3 You are responsible for (a) access to and use of the Subscription Service and Deliverables by the Users on your account and each User\u2019s compliance with these Terms.\n(b) the secure transmission of your Content to the Subscription Service, (c) the legality, reliability, integrity, accuracy and quality of the Content, any conclusions drawn or actions taken therefrom, and the means by which you or the Users acquired the Content so that Lucid and its service providers may lawfully use, process, and transfer the Content in accordance with these Terms.\n(d) if desired, backing-up your Content outside of the Subscription Service.\nand (e) if required, providing qualified personnel to timely perform your duties and tasks specified in an Order or as may be reasonably necessary in connection with Lucid\u2019s performance of the Professional Services and providing Lucid with any information, data and other materials that you agree to provide under an Order related to Professional Services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.4 You acknowledge that the Subscription Service was not designed or intended to process or manage any Protected Information.\nLucid will not be responsible for damages associated with Protected Information created, stored, shared or processed through the Subscription Service.&nbsp.\n\u201cProtected Information\u201d means information that is subject to specific regulations or laws that impose increased protections and/or obligations with respect to handling that type of information or that is not appropriate for use in the Subscription Service, as intended.\nProtected Information includes, without limitation, data that is subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or any similar legislation in an applicable jurisdiction, or any credit or debit card and magnetic stripe information, social security numbers, driver\u2019s license numbers, passport numbers, government issued identification numbers, health-related information, biometric data, financial account information, or information deemed \u201csensitive\u201d under applicable law (such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or philosophical beliefs).</p>\n<p>4.5 You will not and will ensure that each User does not:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(a) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, distribute, provide access, or otherwise commercially exploit, or make the Services or Deliverables available to any third-party except as expressly authorized herein;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b) copy, modify, translate, adapt, merge, or create derivative works of the Services or Deliverables or disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise extract the source code of, or reduce to human-perceivable form, any part of them unless the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(c) use or access the Services or Deliverables (i) for competitive purposes or (ii) other than in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (including export control laws and restrictions);&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(d) remove or modify any proprietary markings or restrictive legends in the Subscription Service or on the Deliverables;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(e) infringe or misappropriate any Lucid Assets;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(f) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the

malicious act or disrupt the security, integrity or operation of the Subscription Service;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(h) access or attempt to access the Subscription Service by any means other than Lucid\u2019s publicly supported interfaces, including through any automated means (i.e.\nuse of scripts or web crawlers);&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(i) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any Lucid system or network.\nor&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(j) access, store, create, share, display, publish or transmit any material that is unlawful or related to illegal activity, threatening, deceptive, defamatory, discriminatory, obscene, libelous, an invasive of another\u2019s privacy, or infringes the intellectual property rights of a third-party through the Subscription Service.</p>5.\nYour Content<p>5.1 As between the parties, you own all right, title, and interest in and to the Content in your account, including all intellectual property and proprietary rights therein.&nbsp.\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, Lucid acquires no right, title, or interest from you hereunder in or to your Content.\n\u201cContent\u201d means the data, information, images, and other content that is uploaded to, imported into or created in the subscription Service by the Users, but does not include Statistical Data (as defined herein).</p>\n<p>5.2 You hereby grant Lucid a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, right to access, use and process the Content: (a) as requested by you or a User.\n(b) as necessary to manage accounts, provide Support and provide and improve the Services, including to identify, investigate, or resolve technical or security problems with the Services and to detect and protect against fraud.\nand (c) as required by applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request and to detect and prevent violations of these Terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5.3 If you believe that Lucid, or any User, has violated a copyright, trademark or other intellectual property right you claim in your work, please contact us at&nbsp;legal@lucidchart.com.\nLucid responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement in accordance with the U.S.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>6.\nMulti-User Accounts<p>6.1 You acknowledge that you retain administrative control as to who is granted access to your account.\nEach account is controlled by an account owner tied to a specific email address and may also have one or more billing admins and team admins to help manage the account.&nbsp.\nLucid is entitled to rely on communications from the account owner and admins when servicing your account.\nIf a person within your organization requests a change to the account owner, we will attempt to contact the account owner for consent, but to the extent that the account owner does not respond to our communications, we will transfer the account owner based on our internal verification methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6.2 When you create Content under an individual plan, that Content is available only to you and others with whom you share the Content.\nHowever, if you are or become an individual User managed under a multi-user subscription plan maintained by your employer or other third-party (a \u201cMulti-User Plan\u201d), such as a Team or Enterprise account, any Content you have created or will create will be subject to control by the applicable account owner and admins, and is no longer \u201cyour Content\u201d for purposes of this Agreement.\nThe account owner and admins under a Multi-User Plan can designate other Users under that Multi-User Plan as owners of the Content you originally created, in which case you may no longer be able to access the Content and may lose any copyright or other rights you held in the Content.\nIn addition, the account owner or admins of such Multi-User Plan may downgrade your access, remove you from the account or permanently delete you from the account without your prior consent.&nbsp.\nIf you have questions about Multi-User Plans, please contact us at&nbsp;support@lucidchart.com&nbsp;or support@lucidpress.com, as applicable.</p>\n<p>6.3&nbsp.\nYou acknowledge and agree that if you are a registered User, and the domain of the email address associated with your Lucid account is owned by an organization, and an authorized representative of that organization wishes to establish a Multi-User Plan and add you to it, then information concerning your existing account will become accessible to that organization, including your name, email address, and Content, and your existing account may be added to the Multi-User Plan without your prior consent.&nbsp.\nIn these situations, any credit remaining on your account may be applied to the Multi-User Plan account.&nbsp.\nIn addition, you acknowledge and agree that if you are or become a registered User on a Multi-User Plan your account information and data will be shared with the owner and admins of the account and your data may also be visible to other Users in the account.</p>\n<p>6.4 If you are the representative of an entity with Multi-User Plan and you choose to enable administrative controls over access to the Subscription Service based on your e-mail domains (i.e.\nLucid\u2019s lock-down and consolidation features), you represent and warrant that the entity owns such e-mail domain(s) and the Content that has been created by individuals with such e-mail domains.\nYou will appoint appropriate admins to manage your account and will be solely responsible for the admins\u2019 acts and omissions.</p>7.\nEducation Accounts<p>7.1 If you are a school, school district, or related person, entity or organization (such as an administrator or educator who accesses the Services on their behalf) (each a \u201cSchool\u201d), then this Section applies to you and \u201cyou\u201d shall mean the School purchasing the account, as well as its Users.</p>\n<p>7.2 You agree (a) to only provide access to the Service to those individuals employed by or enrolled as students in your School or classroom and (b) to be responsible for any Content, communications, and activity that occur under such accounts.&nbsp.\nRegardless of the account level being utilized, to the extent a School offers or requires access to the Services to Minors, the School will be responsible under this Section 7 for those User accounts.</p>\n<p>7.3 \u201cStudent Data\u201d is any information (in any format) that is directly related to any identifiable current or former student that is maintained by a School, and may include \u201ceducational records\u201d as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d) that Schools provide to us.\nWhile we may need to access Student Data to provide the Services to you, Schools own the Student Data and remain responsible for it.\nOur&nbsp;Lucid for Education Privacy Policy&nbsp;provides more detail about how we handle Student Data.</p>\n<p>7.4 Both parties agree to uphold their responsibilities under the FERPA, the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (\u201cPPRA\u201d), and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).\nWe provide the Services under the \u201cschool official\u201d exception of FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1).\nCOPPA requires that online service providers obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13.\nYou represent and warrant that you have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents in order for us to collect information from students before allowing children under the age of 13 to access our Services.\nWe recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as Lucid&nbsp;and that they provide a copy of our&nbsp;Lucid for Education Privacy Policy&nbsp;to parents and guardians.\nIf you are located outside of the United States, you will obtain any required consent or approval from the parent or guardian of any student covered by similar laws and, as a condition to your and your students' use of the Services, you agree that you will be responsible for complying with such laws.</p>8.\nIndemnification<p>8.1 Lucid will defend you, your officers, directors and employees (the \u201cCustomer Indemnified Parties\u201d) against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding (each, a \u201cClaim\u201d) made or brought against the Customer Indemnified Parties by a third-party alleging that a Subscription Service or a Deliverable infringes or misappropriates such third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, and will indemnify the Customer Indemnified Parties from any finally awarded damages or settlement amount and reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the extent arising from such Claim.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Lucid will not be obligated to indemnify the Customer Indemnified Parties if an infringement or misappropriation claim arises from: (a) the Content.\n(b) a User\u2019s misuse of a Subscription Service or Deliverable.\n(c) a User\u2019s use of the Subscription Service or Deliverable in combination with any products, services, or technology provided by a third-party or a modification of the Subscription Service or Deliverable by you or a User, if the Subscription Service or Deliverable or use thereof would not infringe without such combination or modification.\nor (d) continued use of the Subscription Service or Deliverable after notice by Lucid to discontinue use.\nIf an infringement or misappropriation Claim is made or threatened, Lucid may, in its sole discretion: (i) replace or modify the infringing Subscription Service or Deliverable so that it is non-infringing (but functionally equivalent).\n(ii) procure the right for you to continue using the Subscription Service or Deliverable.\nor (iii) notwithstanding Lucid\u2019s obligation to indemnify hereunder, terminate use of the infringing Subscription Service or Deliverable and refund any unused prepaid fees covering the terminated portion of the Subscription Service or Deliverable.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8.2 You will defend Lucid and Lucid\u2019s affiliates, and their respective officers, directors and employees (the \u201cLucid Indemnified Parties\u201d) against any Claim made or brought against the Lucid Indemnified Parties by a third-party or User (a) alleging your Content infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property rights.\n(b) related to ownership of your Content.\nor (c) related to an admin\u2019s actions with respect to your account, and will indemnify the Lucid Indemnified Parties from any finally awarded damages or settlement amount and reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) to the extent arising from such Claim.</p>\n<p>8.3 A party seeking indemnification (the \u201cIndemnified Party\u201d) will provide the other party (the \u201cIndemnifying Party\u201d) prompt written notice upon becoming aware of any Claim subject to indemnification hereunder (a delay in providing notice does not excuse these obligations unless the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay) and reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in the defense, investigation or settlement of any Claim at the Indemnifying Party\u2019s expense.\nThe Indemnifying Party will have sole control of such defense, provided that the Indemnified Party may participate in its own defense at its sole expense.\nThe Indemnifying Party may not settle a Claim without the Indemnified Party\u2019s consent if such settlement imposes a payment or other obligation on the Indemnified Party.\nThis Section states the Indemnifying Party\u2019s sole liability to, and the Indemnified Party\u2019s exclusive remedy for, any claim or action described in this Section.</p>9.\nBilling, Payment and Renewal<p>9.1 If you select a paid tier of the Subscription Service (a \u201cpaid account\u201d) Lucid will bill you in advance for use of the Services on the frequency that you select.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.2 Current pricing for non-enterprise accounts are published on the Lucid Websites.\nLucid reserves the right to modify pricing at any time for renewal terms.\nprovided, that Lucid will notify you or the account admin prior to any price increase affecting that account.\nIf you upgrade to a higher tier of paid account, Lucid will credit any remaining balance from your previous subscription payment to your new tier.</p>\n<p>9.3 All payments due are in U.S.\ndollars unless otherwise indicated on the subscription pricing page, Order or invoice.&nbsp.\nCredit card, debit card or other non-invoice forms of payment are due at the beginning of the relevant subscription term.\nLucid will charge you for all fees when due.\nLucid may enable other forms of payment in the Account Settings page, which may be subject to additional terms.\nPayments for invoices are due ten days after the invoice date, unless otherwise specified, and are considered delinquent thereafter.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.4 Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each subscription term and you authorize Lucid to charge the credit card, debit card or other non-invoice forms of payment for each renewal.\nIf you wish to change your subscription level, number of Users, subscription term, or cancel your auto-renewal, the account owner or the admin must change the settings in the Account Settings page provided in the Subscription Service or contact our customer support team prior to the renewal date.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>9.5 Billing disputes must be notified to Lucid in writing before the due date.\nDelinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law) from the payment due date until paid in full.\nYou will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Lucid in collecting delinquent amounts.&nbsp.\nIf delinquent fees are not paid, Lucid will automatically downgrade your account to a free account and/or suspend or terminate your use of the Services.&nbsp.\nDowngrading your account may cause the loss of Content, features, functionality or capacity.&nbsp.\nIf you require a purchase order, vendor registration form, or other documentation, such requirement will in no way relieve, affect or delay your obligation to pay amounts when due.</p>\n<p>9.6 You are responsible for any taxes, duties, and customs fees associated with the sale of the Services (other than Lucid\u2019s income tax) (collectively \u201cTaxes\u201d), and you will pay Lucid for the Services without any reduction for Taxes.\nIf Lucid is obligated to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide Lucid with a valid tax exemption certificate.\nIf you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to Lucid, you must provide Lucid with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding and reimburse Lucid for such withholding tax.</p>\n<p>9.7 Unless otherwise agreed to in an Order, Professional Services will be performed remotely and are provided on a time and materials basis (\u201cT&amp;M\u201d) at the rates set forth in the Order.\nT&amp;M estimates are not a guarantee that the project will be completed in the estimated number of hours.\nActual T&amp;M hours may be more or less.&nbsp.\nIn addition, you will reimburse Lucid for reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses (including all travel costs and expenses) incurred by Lucid in the course of providing Professional Services that are authorized or pre-approved by Customer in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.8 If you elect to purchase certain Services through a third-party agent (\u201cProcurement Agent\u201d), your obligation for payment to, and relationship with, such Procurement Agent is between you and the Procurement Agent.&nbsp.\nYou will remain liable for the fees payable to Lucid for the Services as well as the other obligations set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>9.9 Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or when required by law, all fees are non-cancellable and once paid are non-refundable, even in the case of unused subscription periods.</p>10.\nConfidentiality<p>10.1 \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means non-public, proprietary, business, technical, security, legal, or financial information that is either marked or identified as Confidential Information or would reasonably be understood to be confidential, including information about products, processes, services, trade secrets, marketing and business plans, client lists, financial information, system architecture, security programs, and intellectual property.\nFor avoidance of doubt, the price you pay for the Services constitutes Lucid\u2019s Confidential Information.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) the receiving party possesses without a duty to keep confidential prior to acquiring it from the disclosing party.\n(b) is or becomes publicly available through no violation of this Agreement by the receiving party.\n(c) is given to the receiving party by a third-party not under a confidentiality obligation to the disclosing party.\nor (d) is developed by the receiving party independently of, and without reliance on, confidential or proprietary information provided by the disclosing party.</p>\n<p>10.2 Each party may be given access to Confidential Information of the other party in connection with these Terms.\nThe receiving party may only use this Confidential Information as provided for in these Terms or to exercise its rights hereunder and may only share this Confidential Information with its employees, agents, advisors and service providers who need to know it, provided they are subject to similar confidentiality obligations.\nThe receiving party will use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, as such party uses with respect to its own Confidential Information to protect the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information and to prevent any unauthorized use or disclosure thereof.\nNeither party will be responsible for any loss, destruction, alteration or disclosure of Confidential Information caused by any third-party.&nbsp.\nIf the receiving party is compelled by law to disclose the other party\u2019s Confidential Information, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to give the disclosing party prior written notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party\u2019s cost, if the disclosing party wishes to contest the disclosure.</p>\n<p>10.3 If you utilize a Procurement Agent, Lucid is permitted to disclose Confidential Information (including these Terms and any Orders) to such Procurement Agent that is necessary to effectuate such transaction.</p>11.\nData Security, privacy and your personal information<p>11.1 Lucid\u2019s&nbsp;Privacy Policy&nbsp;explains how Lucid treats your personal information and protects your privacy when you use the Websites and Subscription Service.\nIf you use our Websites or are an individual User of a Subscription Service or part of a team account, you agree to the use of your data, including personal information, in accordance with&nbsp;Lucid\u2019s

use of the Services as acceptance of the updated Terms.&nbsp.\nIf you have a paid account, the new Terms will apply upon your renewal.&nbsp;</p>20.\nGeneral legal terms<p>20.1 Unless otherwise specified in an Order, the Services are provided by, and you are contracting with, Lucid Software Inc., and references to \u201cLucid\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, and \u201cour\u201d are references to Lucid Software Inc., located at 10355 S.\nJordan Gateway, Suite 150, South Jordan, UT 84095, United States.&nbsp.\nThese Terms, and your relationship with Lucid under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without regard to its conflict or choice of laws rules.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>20.2 The parties agree that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation.\nIf you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action you will contact us at legal@lucidchart.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account).\nExcept for the Excluded Disputes (defined below), the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation with each other, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating an arbitration (the \u201cCooperative Resolution Process\u201d).\nIf the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time the Cooperative Resolution Process is initiated, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve any dispute (except as set forth in Section 20.6) subject to the terms set forth below.</p>\n<p>20.3 Any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to, connected with, or arising out of the subject matter of these Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (a \u201cDispute\u201d), shall be determined by arbitration in Salt Lake City, Utah before one arbitrator.\nThe arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.\nJudgment on an award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThis clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nAny demand for arbitration under these Terms shall be made before the statute of limitations applicable to such claim has expired.\nIn any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recovery any such damages.</p>\n<p>20.4 The parties agree that an arbitrator shall not have authority to conduct class arbitration of any Dispute.\nYou and Lucid each agree that any arbitration or court action to resolve any Dispute will take place on an individual basis without resort to any form of class, consolidated, or representative action (the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d).\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER PRECLUDES ANY PARTY FROM PARTICIPATING IN OR BEING REPRESENTED IN ANY CLASS OR REPRSENTATIVE ACTION FOR ANY DISPUTE, INCLUDING CONSUMER DISPUTES AND BUSINESS DISPUTES.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the Class Action Waiver is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Disputes.</p>\n<p>20.5 The failure of either party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision or of any other right or provision.\nTo the extent the arbitration provisions herein are void or unenforceable, and for all Excluded Disputes, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Salt Lake County, Utah, or the District of Utah to resolve any Dispute.\nAny legal or arbitration proceeding will be in the English language.</p>\n<p>20.6 Notwithstanding the parties\u2019 decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, the following Disputes may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction: (a) disputes relating to or arising from misappropriation, infringement, validity and/or enforceability of a party\u2019s intellectual property rights (\u201cintellectual property rights\u201d means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights), (b) any action by a party seeking entry of a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunctive relief, or permanent injunctive relief, or (c) any claims that, as a matter of law, the parties cannot agree to arbitrate (collectively, the \u201cExcluded Disputes\u201d).</p>\n<p>20.7 These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Lucid related to the use of the Services and supersede all prior or contemporaneous representations, agreements or understandings (written or verbal) relating to the subject matter hereof.&nbsp.\nAny terms and conditions appearing on a purchase order or similar document issued by you do not apply to the Services, do not override or form a part of these Terms, and are void and of no effect.&nbsp.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p>20.8 You agree that Lucid may provide you notices by email, regular mail, or postings on the Services.&nbsp.\nYou may provide notice to Lucid by emailing legal@lucidchart.com.</p>\n<p>20.9 Each party acknowledges that any breach, threatened or actual, of Sections 5.1, 10 and 13 may cause irreparable injury to the other party for which there may not be an adequate remedy at law.\nTherefore, upon any such breach or threat thereof, the party alleging breach shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies available to it, without the requirement of posting a bond.</p>\n<p>20.10 The parties are independent contractors.\nThis Agreement does not create or imply any agency, partnership, or franchise relationship.\nThis Agreement is intended for the benefit of the parties and not any third-party.\nNeither party has the authority to assume or create any obligation on behalf of the other party.</p>\n<p>20.11 Neither party is liable for delay or default hereunder if caused by conditions beyond its reasonable control, including natural disasters, acts of God, hacker attacks, acts of terror or war, riots, actions or decrees of governmental bodies, changes in applicable laws, or communication or power failures.</p>\n<p>20.12 Neither the rights nor the obligations arising under these Terms are assignable or transferable by either party without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and any attempted assignment or transfer shall be void and without effect.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Lucid may assign this agreement (including all Orders) without the consent of the other party to a successor in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets in aggregate or related to your Services.\nSubject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors, and permitted assigns.</p>\n<p>20.13 Where Lucid has provided you with a translation of the English language version of the Terms, you agree that the translation is provided for your convenience only and that the English language version of the Terms will govern your relationship with Lucid.&nbsp.\nIf there is any contradiction between the English language version of the Terms and a translation, the English language version shall take precedence.</p>Stay up to date with us:&nbsp;&nbsp;RSS<ul>\n<li>Get
