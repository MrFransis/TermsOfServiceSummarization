third parties to whom we may disclose or who may collect personal information may have their own privacy policies that describe how they use and disclose personal information.\nExcept for companies affiliated with AgileRates.com and authorized service providers, who agree to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to personal information we share with them, the third parties' privacy policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you want to learn more about

information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing all such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or for which access is not otherwise required.\nAll requests are also subject to the next section below (\"Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information\").</p>\n<p>We also maintain an information security program that limits storage of personal information to what is needed to fulfill our reasonable business, legal and audit requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be

to&nbsp;privacy@excelimpact.com.\nWe will process your request, where possible and subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy, within a reasonable period of time after receipt.\nHowever, federal and state regulations and/or the need to administer our relationships with our ad networks and other third parties may require that we store certain information for various periods of time.\nIn order to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information from our database until the expiration of the applicable period.\nHowever, we will use reasonable commercial efforts to delete your personal information no later than three (3) months after receiving your request, unless a longer retention period is required by law.\nPlease also be

request.\nWe may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as requests for additional information, confirmations, service updates or announcements, administrative notices and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.\nPlease note that opting out of receipt of commercial e-mail communications will only affect future activities or communications from us.\nIf we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.\nFor example, with regard to&nbsp;AgileRates.com's&nbsp;internal operations, only authorized employees and authorized third party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions.\nWe follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,

court, if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate section (this \"Agreement to Arbitrate\").</p>\n<p>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding, including but not limited to actions under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 227 et seq.\nUnless both you and us agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form if a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award relief, including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief, only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s).\nAny relief awarded cannot affect our other users.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Procedures</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of the Agreement to Arbitrate or this Agreement is void or voidable.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related

http://www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant.\nAttendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>This arbitration provision

of fees by us should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse us for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by us on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>\n<p>Costs of Arbitration</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.\nIf the value of

enforce the award and for disclosure in confidence to the parties' respective attorneys, tax advisors and senior management and to family members of a party who is an individual.</p>\n<p>Severability</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>With the exception of any of the provisions in of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\"), if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.\nIf an arbitrator or court decides that any of the provisions in Section 1 of this Agreement to Arbitrate (\"Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\") is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the Agreement and its Legal Disputes Section will continue to
