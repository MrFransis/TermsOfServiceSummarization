Here we describe how we might collect, use and handle your personal data when you use our privacy and security services.</p>\n<p>But first, we want to highlight two major principles that drive our day-to-day decisions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Minimize data collection:</strong> we will always build services where the collection or use of your personal data is as small as possible, even sometimes not collecting any personal data at all, and you will always know about it and chose if you agree to such collection, or not;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maximize security:</strong> security of our services and your personal data is our priority.\nThis means that we will always choose the highest standards for ensuring the security of your personal data and the best services to process your personal data, when necessary to use 3rd party products or services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever your choices are with regards to your activity with Jumbo Privacy, we will never EVER sell your personal data.</p>\n<p>As a privacy company, we want your privacy and your use of Jumbo Privacy to be fully transparent and understandable.\nTherefore, we have made a summary of all the services Jumbo Privacy provides you, and how every service impacts your personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please find hereunder more information on the processing of personal data made by Jumbo Privacy \u2013 2121 Atelier Inc.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Title 1 \u2013 Jumbo Features you may use</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 1.\nPrivacy &amp.\nSecurity Services in the Jumbo App</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Jumbo App is a mobile application available on iOS and Android who helps you manage your online privacy and security.</p>\n<p>By using the Jumbo App, you are asking the Jumbo App to make changes to your privacy settings and/or personal data.\nThis is what we call \u201cprocessing of your personal data\u201d.\nThis is why when you open the Jumbo App for the first time, you will see a pop-up displaying a link to this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>This privacy policy explains how the processing is done by us, in compliance with applicable laws protecting your privacy.\nBefore using the Jumbo App, we kindly ask you to read this privacy policy carefully and agree to its terms to continue using the Jumbo App if you agree to it.\nIf you do not agree with this privacy policy, please do not use the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>\n<em>A.\nFunctionalities</em>\n</p>\n<p>Every step of the way, you are the one controlling and deciding how to manage your personal data and privacy settings related to the accounts you link to the Jumbo App.\nThe Jumbo App will never change anything in your accounts without your prior authorization.\nConsequently, we are only processing your data because you have consented to it and/or because we are performing a service you have requested from us.</p>\n<p>(i) Subscription to a Jumbo Plan</p>\n<p>If you decide to subscribe to a Jumbo Plan (i.e.\nJumbo Plus or Jumbo Pro as described in our TOU) your account information necessary to grant you such subscription will be processed by Apple, if you use the iOS version of the Jumbo App, or Google if you use the Android version of the Jumbo App.\nYour personal data processed by Google and Apple to grant you the subscription to a Jumbo Plan include your Google or Apple account information, your name, your email, your payment details, as well as your personal data to enable your subscription (subscription ID and transaction ID).</p>\n<p>Jumbo Privacy has no access to your account information, even your name.\nApple and Google only send Jumbo Privacy your subscription ID and transaction ID to confirm your subscription, and to allow us to give you access to the Jumbo Plan you have subscribed to directly in your phone.</p>\n<p>Your personal data is stored by Apple and Google until you delete it, except for your payment data, which is kept by Apple and Google for duration imposed by tax regulations in your country.\nFor more information on how Apple and Google use your data, please consult Title 2 on Processors.</p>\n<p>\n<em>(ii) Change of the privacy settings of your online accounts</em>\n</p>\n<p>We offer you the possibility to scan some of your online accounts through the Jumbo App to suggest privacy changes to your account settings.\nYou can choose what online account you want to scan through the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>To inform you of the changes we suggest, we will ask you to log into your account through the Jumbo App, using your username and password.\nThe authentication of your account will be made in your phone during the whole process.\nWe do not store any of this personal data in the Jumbo Cloud.</p>\n<p>We might also offer you to save your password for some online services to avoid having to log in, every time you use the Jumbo App.\nIf you chose to do so your password will be stored within the Jumbo App in your phone.\nIn no event will Jumbo Privacy have access to your password.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish for your password to be stored in your phone, please do not use the features that allow such storing of password within the Jumbo App.\nTo delete your passwords, please disconnect your account from the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>When you connect and authenticate any service through the Jumbo App, you are technically leaving the Jumbo App and signing on to your dedicated account on such service.\nTherefore, the service might be collecting data related to such authentication.\nFor more information, we advise you to read the respective service\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>(iii) <em>Transfer and Storage of your personal content</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you decide to transfer some of your personal content, the transfer of such personal content will be made directly from your account to the storage space you have selected.\nThis can be the Jumbo App or a third-party storage space selected.</p>\n<p>If you decide to store your personal content in the Jumbo App, your personal content will be stored in your phone.\nWe do not have access to your personal content, and it is not stored in Jumbo Cloud.</p>\n<p>If you want to delete your personal content, please delete the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>If you decide to transfer your personal content directly to a third party, we suggest you verify the third party\u2019s privacy policy before deciding to transfer your personal data to them.\nIndeed, we suggest them in our app, but we do not have a business relationship with them.\nWe also do not endorse them, nor are affiliated to them.\nThis means that we are not responsible for how your data is stored with them.</p>\n<p>(iv) <em>Data breach feature</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you chose to verify if your email address was in a data breach, a hash of your email address you indicate will be transmitted from the Jumbo App, to SpyCloud through Jumbo Cloud.\nThis means that the hash of your email address will be on Jumbo Cloud for less than one second, and then transferred to SpyCloud.\nRather than verifying a breach with your plain-text email (e.g.\njohn@smith.com,) we query it with a hash (something that looks like this \u201c642020b48e8f9706b14bc695f3b1f4ad719553df\u201d.) A hash is created with what\u2019s called a \u201cone-way-function\u201d which is practically infeasible to revert and as such makes any potential leak of this data less impactful.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we never look at your email address nor store it.\nWe use Microsoft Azure as our datacenter provider, and Cloudflare (more information on Cloudflare here) as our DNS provider (we also use cloudflare to proxy requests to Azure.) SpyCloud will use the hash of your email address only for the purpose of checking if your email address appeared in a data breach.</p>\n<p>You can, at any time, disconnect this feature.\nThe hash of your email will be stored for security reasons by SpyCloud for 6 years.</p>\n<p>(v) <em>Privacy Requests/Delete My Data</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you chose to use the Privacy Requests/Delete My Data functionality to delete some of your personal data, or to opt-out from some services, you are mandating Jumbo Privacy to act as your privacy agent.\nWe will only act as your privacy agent towards the services you have selected in the Jumbo App and for the privacy requests (access, opt-out, deletion) you have chosen in the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>We need your legal full name and your signature to complete the mandate for exercise of privacy rights, and for the email address used to sign up to the account you want to associate to your Privacy Request in order to confirm the authentication ID.\nWe also use your email address to send you the mandate for your review and signature.</p>\n<p>We might also collect your advertising ID (IDFA/AAID) directly in your phone, if you chose to make privacy requests related to such advertising ID, when necessary.</p>\n<p>The mandate is sent to you by Docusign which is a certifier of electronic signature.\nFor more information about the use of your email address by Docusign, please see here.</p>\n<p>By signing the mandate you agree that Jumbo Privacy will process your personal data to make the privacy requests you have selected and notably that your full legal name, email, privacy requests and signed mandate will be sent to the service providers you have selected in the Jumbo App.\nWe use Helpscout to send these emails.\nFor more information about the use of your personal information by Helpscout, please see here.</p>\n<p>Once the privacy requests have been successfully processed, upon expiration of a period of twelve months during which you have not used the Delete My Data feature, we will send you a notification through the Jumbo App, to ask if you want to terminate your mandate from our archives.\nPlease consult our TOU for more information.</p>\n<p>Once a mandate is terminated, we keep a record of your Privacy Requests and your mandate for two years in Jumbo Cloud in case we have any claims from you or the services you ask us to make Privacy Requests to, as proof you lawfully mandated us.</p>\n<p>(vi) Secure Together</p>\n<p>When you invite friends or if you have been invited to join Jumbo Privacy through the Secure Together feature, we collect a hash of the invitee\u2019s email address for us to send an email to them, and/or to confirm that they have downloaded the Jumbo App, and notify the inviter.</p>\n<p>The hash of the invitee\u2019s email addresses is stored in Jumbo Cloud for thirty days\u2019 from the date of collection to give the invitee time to download the Jumbo App and send us such confirmation.\nFor more information about Jumbo Cloud, please see below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>B.\nYour rights</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>How to access, rectify, or delete your personal data?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Except for Delete My Data and Secure Together, Jumbo Privacy does not access or store any of your personal data.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you can access rectify, or delete the accounts you have managed through the Jumbo App and/or the data you have stored within the Jumbo App at any time directly in the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>If you want to delete any data stored in the Jumbo App, you need to delete the Jumbo App from your phone.</p>\n<p>You can access, rectify, or delete your data related to Delete My Data or Secure Together at any time, by sending an email to privacy@jumboprivacy.com</p>\n<p>If you are not able to do any of this, you want help doing so or have any related questions, please send an email to support@jumboprivacy.com.</p>\n<p>For more

your use of Jumbo app in order to improve the quality and design of the Jumbo app and your experience as a user of the Jumbo App.</p>\n<p>We do not track or store any of your personal data with this analytic tool.\nInstead, Apple/Google generate a unique identifier linked to your phone and your use of the Jumbo App called a \u201cdeviceID\u201d, which we use to identify a user from another in an anonymous way.</p>\n<p>The Jumbo App sends your analytics data to our analytics provider: Amplitude.\nFor more information about Amplitude, please see here.\nIn Amplitude.\nYour deviceID and usage of

any time, directly from the Jumbo App, and we will no longer collect analytic data from your device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 3.\nPush Notifications</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may send you updates about the Jumbo App and Jumbo Privacy by sending you push notifications through the Jumbo App if you have given us your prior approval to do so.</p>\n<p>You may opt-out of receiving these notifications at any time by changing the appropriate settings within your device.\nTo send you push notifications, we store and use a serial number which was generated by Apple or Google, depending of the version of the Jumbo App you are using, best known as a \u201ctoken\u201d, which is unique to your use of the Jumbo App in your phone.</p>\n<p>To send you such push notifications, we use MongoDB as service provider.\nFor more information about MongoDB, please see here.</p>\n<p>Your token is stored by MongoDB, and in the Jumbo Cloud.\nYour token is stored until you change your settings or request us to
