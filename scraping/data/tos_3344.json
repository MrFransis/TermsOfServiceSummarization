accounts (including any person with implied, actual, or apparent authority) or anyone who gains access to your account as a result of your failure to safeguard your authentication credentials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Payment Methods</u>.\nYou authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if it fails, to charge any other payment method

change takes effect and (ii) your continued use of or subscription to the Service after the price change takes effect constitutes your agreement to pay the new price for the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Delinquency</u>.\nAfter 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Service will be deemed delinquent and we may terminate or suspend your account and fee-based Service for nonpayment.\nYou are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>90-Day Notice Period</u>.\nYou must notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your billing method statement.\nIf you do not bring them to our attention within 90 days, you agree that you waive your right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>About

also both agree that:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong>&nbsp;If either you or&nbsp;we intend to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration.\nNotice to&nbsp;us&nbsp;should be sent either by mail to Verizon Media, Attn: Disputes, 701

arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong>&nbsp;The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms.\nExcept for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nThe AAA will apply the&nbsp;<u>Commercial Arbitration Rules</u>&nbsp;to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's&nbsp;<u>Consumer Arbitration Rules</u>&nbsp;will apply (excluding any rules or

provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Location.</strong>&nbsp;Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees and Expenses.</strong>&nbsp;We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute.\nIf you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.\nIf the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Settlement Offers.</strong>&nbsp;We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration.\nThe amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim.\nIf you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute.\nIf the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability.&nbsp;</strong>If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s).\nHowever, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof.\nAny Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable.\nTo avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of

information.\nFirst, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide our services to you, in accordance with our Terms of Service.\nThis processing is necessary to perform the contract between you and us.\nSecond, where you have given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your consent.\nThird, in certain cases, we may process your information where necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests.\nOccasionally, Verizon Media may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect a user\u2019s vital interests (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm) or to comply with a legal obligation.\nPlease see our Legal bases page for more information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Processing and Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>When you use or interact with any of our

to transfer, process, store and use your information in countries other than your own in accordance with this Privacy Policy and to provide you with Services.\nSome of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as the country where you reside.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Verizon Media processes information related to individuals in the EU/EEA/UK and transfers that information from the EU/EEA/UK through various compliance mechanisms, including data processing agreements based on the European Commission\u2019sA Standard Contractual Clauses.\nBy using our Services, you

third country outside the EU/EEA/UK, some of these countries may not have the same data protection safeguards as your home country.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other Important Information</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>This Privacy Policy Applies Only to Verizon Media.&nbsp;</strong>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Verizon

are not subject to this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Changes</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so you should check it
