operators, we collect non-personally-identifying information such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.</p>\n<p>We collect this to understand how our visitors use our service, and use it to make decisions about how to change and adapt the service.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in aggregate form (for instance, by publishing trends in site usage) to explain our reasoning in making decisions.\nWe will not release individual information, only aggregate information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personally-identifying</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We automatically collect personally-identifying information, such as IP address, provided by your browser and your computer.</p>\n<p>We collect this information for several purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To diagnose and repair network issues with your use of the site;</li>\n<li>To estimate the number of users accessing the service from specific geographic regions;</li>\n<li>To help prevent fraud and abuse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An individual journal owner may enable IP address logging for comments made to their journal or community.\nIf this option is enabled, we will disclose your IP address to the owner of that journal or community if you make a comment to that journal.\nWe will tell you at the time of commenting if this option is enabled.</p> Information you are required to provide to us on registration <p>In order to register for the service, you must give us your email address.\nWe will use your email address to send confirmation of certain actions, such as when you change your password.\nWe will contact you when it's necessary to complete a transaction that you've initiated, or if there's a critical or administrative issue affecting your use of the service.</p>\n<p>Once you have created your account, you can choose to subscribe to certain events and have notifications of those events sent to you via email.\nYou will be able to change your mind and opt out of receiving notifications via email at any time.</p>\n<p>When you register, you must also give us your date of birth.\nThis is to make sure we aren't accidentally collecting information from children, which is prohibited by United States law.\nWe save this information so that we can prove we're complying with that law.\nOnce you've created your account, you can specify a birthdate to make public, which does not have to be your actual date of birth.</p>\n<p>We will never sell or provide your email address or your date of birth to any third party, with exceptions as set forth below.\n</p> Optional information you provide to us <p>As you use the service, you have the option to provide more personal information, through your profile, your entries, or comments you make.\nProviding this information is strictly optional.</p>\n<p>We will show this information to others viewing the site, in accordance with the privacy options you've

are not used for any other purpose.</p> Account contents <p>You may optionally post content to your account with varying security levels.\nTo the best of our ability, and limited only by the possibility of bugs or technical difficulties, we will honor the security levels you choose for your content and display that content only to those whom you have authorized to see it.</p>\n<p>While maintaining the site, Dreamwidth staff may need to view the contents of your account, including information for which you have chosen a restrictive security level.\nCircumstances in which this is necessary include, but are not limited to: troubleshooting and diagnosing technical problems, investigating possible Terms of Service violations, and legal compliance issues.</p>\n<p>Dreamwidth staff

law.\nAny use of this ability is logged and regularly audited.</p> Financial information and transactions <p>You can engage in financial transactions with Dreamwidth to purchase enhancements for your account.\nThese transactions are optional.\nIf you choose to purchase enhanced services, you will be asked to provide financial information to complete the transaction.\nThere are several payment methods available, each of which requires disclosure of certain personal and financial information.\nThe specifics of these methods of payment are as follows:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Credit cards</b>: If you pay by credit card, we need you to provide your credit card number, your full name as it appears on the card, your address as it appears on the card statement, and the CVN or Card Verification Number.\nThis information is required so we can authorize and charge your credit card.\nYour financial information is protected by industry-standard encryption methods.\nIt is never stored on our servers: we pass it immediately along to our processor for the sole purpose of completing the authorized transaction.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Checks</b>: If you pay by check, we need you to provide us with a check printed with your bank's routing code and your account number, your name, and your address.\nThis information is required so our bank can transfer funds from your account to ours.\nWe use this information only for the purpose of the single transaction represented by the check, however, our bank retains, on their servers, permanent electronic scans of all checks deposited into our account.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Money orders</b>: If you pay by money order, we need you to provide us with a money order or international money order (as appropriate depending on the country in which you're currently living).\nWe do not require the disclosure of any personal information to use a money order as payment beyond a signature on the face of the money order.\nHowever, the location that issues your money order may require you to write additional personal information on the money order.\nOur bank retains, on their servers, permanent electronic scans of all money orders deposited into our account.</p>\n<p>In all cases, Dreamwidth collects this personal and financial information only as necessary or appropriate for the completion of the single requested transaction.\nAny additional personally-identifying but non-financial information you disclose during these transactions will be governed by the \"Disclosure of personally-identifying information\" provisions below.</p>

operate the service and (ii) have agreed not to disclose it to others.\nSome of these employees and contractors may be located outside your home country.\nBy using this website, you consent to the transfer of your information to them.</p>\n<p>If all of our assets were transferred or acquired, your information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.</p>\n<p>We may disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information when that release is required by law or by court order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the safety or rights of us, third parties, or the public at large.</p> Special rules regarding children <p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ('COPPA') requires that we inform parents on how we collect and disclose the personal information of children under the age of 13.</p>\n<p>We do not permit children under the age of 13 to use our service.\nTo prevent this, we collect date of birth at the time of account creation.\nIf your child under the age of 13 has mis-represented their age at account creation, please contact us at coppa@dreamwidth.org.\nAfter confirming your identity, we will remove the account.</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the

choose.\nAfter this time, all your personally-identifying information will be removed entirely from our service, with the exception of any records we must retain to document compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>\n<p>As part of the day to day operation of Dreamwidth Studios, we will make regular copies of the data contained in the databases for backup purposes.\nThese backups can potentially
