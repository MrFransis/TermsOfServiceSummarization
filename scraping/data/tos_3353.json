(\"Policy\") sets out how Flight Centre Travel Group Limited (ACN 003 377 188) and its subsidiaries, related bodies corporate and franchisees worldwide, and all their brands, including but not limited to Flight Centre, Student Flights, Travel Associates, Flight Centre Business Travel, Flight Centre Sports &amp.\nEvents, Aunt Betty, BYOjet and Travel Money Oz (collectively referred to in this document as \"Flight Centre\u201d, \"we\" \"our\" or \"us\") protects the privacy of your personal information.</p>\n<p>Flight Centre is one of the world's largest travel agency groups.\nWe need to collect, use and disclose personal information in order to perform our business functions and activities, including making and managing travel bookings on behalf of our customers.\nWe are firmly committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information and to maintaining various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect personal information in our care.</p>\n<p>By providing personal information to us (either directly or allowing another person to do so on your behalf), you agree that this Policy will apply to how we handle your personal information and you consent to us collecting, using and disclosing your personal information as detailed in this Policy.\nIf you do not agree with any part of this Policy, you must not provide your personal information to us.\nIf you do not provide us with your personal information, or if you withdraw a consent that you have given under this Policy, this may affect our ability to provide services to you or negatively impact the services we can provide to you.\nFor example, most travel bookings must be made under the traveller's full name and must include contact details and appropriate identification (e.g.\npassport details).\nWe cannot make bookings for you without that information.</p>\n<p>There may be instances where your local data protection laws impose more restrictive information handling practices than the practices set out in this Policy.\nWhere this occurs we will adjust our information handling practices in your jurisdiction to comply with these local data protection laws.</p> 2.\nWhat personal information do we collect? <p>Personal information has the meaning given under your local data protection law.\nPersonal information generally means information which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that information, or from that information and other information in a person\u2019s possession, including any expression of opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in material form or not, about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual, and any indication of intention in respect of an individual.</p>\n<p>Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you is the information that is needed to facilitate your travel arrangements and bookings and to arrange travel related services and/or products on your behalf.\nFor example, we may collect details such as your name, residential/mailing address, telephone number, email address, credit/debit card details (including card type, card number, security number and expiry date), passport details, loyalty program / frequent flyer details, information about your dietary requirements and health issues (if any), and other details relevant to your travel arrangements or required by the relevant travel service provider(s) (e.g.\nairlines and accommodation or tour providers).\nWhen you make contact with us for other purposes, we may also collect personal information about you in relation to those purposes.\nFor example, we may collect your personal information so we can contact you about a competition you have entered (e.g.\nif you win) or to respond to an enquiry or feedback you have sent to us.\nWe also collect information that is required for use in the business activities of Flight Centre and our related entities, including for example, financial details necessary in order to process various transactions, video surveillance footage used for security purposes, and other relevant personal information you may elect to provide to us.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, we may collect personal information from you which may be regarded as sensitive information under your local data protection laws.\nSensitive information may include (without limitation) your racial or ethnic origin, philosophical or religious beliefs or affiliations, sexual preferences or practices, criminal record and the alleged commission of an offence, membership of political, professional or trade associations, biometric and genetic information, passwords and financial information and health information, and (in the USA) any personal information relating to a child under the age of 13.\nWe will only collect sensitive information in compliance with your local data protection laws, with your consent and/or where it is reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our functions or activities (e.g.\nto make travel arrangements), unless we are otherwise required or authorised to do so by law.\nTo the extent permitted or required under your local data protection laws, you consent to us using and disclosing your sensitive information for the purpose for which it was collected, unless we subsequently receive your consent to use it for another purpose.\nFor example, if you provide health information to us in connection with a travel insurance application you would like to make, you consent to us using and disclosing that health information in connection with arranging that travel insurance on your behalf.\nA further example is if you disclose your religious beliefs to us because you are interested in, for example, certain holiday packages, in which case you consent to us using and disclosing that information in connection with facilitating your request.\nWe will not use sensitive information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, unless we subsequently receive your consent to use it for another purpose.</p> 3.\nHow do we collect personal information? <p>We will collect personal information directly from you unless it is unreasonable or impracticable to do so.\nGenerally, this collection will occur when you deal with us either in person, by telephone, letter, facsimile, email, when you visit any of our websites or when you connect with us via social media.\nWe may collect personal information about you when you purchase or make enquiries about travel arrangements or other products and services.\nwhen you enter competitions or register for promotions.\nwhen you subscribe to receive marketing from us (e.g.\ne-newsletters).\nwhen you request brochures or other information from us.\nor when you provide information, or use our services, on social media.\nUnless you choose to do so under a pseudonym or anonymously, we may also collect your personal information (other than sensitive information) when you complete surveys or provide us with feedback.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances, it may be necessary for us to collect personal information about you from a third party.\nThis includes where a person makes a travel booking on your behalf which includes travel arrangements to be used by you (e.g.\na family or group booking or a travel booking made for you by your employer).\nWhere this occurs, we will rely on the authority of the person making the travel booking to act on behalf of any other traveller on the booking.\nBy providing your personal information to us, either directly or through a family member, employer or other agent or representative in connection with a travel booking or related service, you will be deemed to have consented to your personal information being collected by us and used and disclosed in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<p>Where you make a travel booking on behalf of another person (e.g.\na family or group booking or a travel booking made for an employee), you agree you have obtained the consent of the other person for Flight Centre to collect, use and disclose the other person's personal information in accordance with this Policy and that you have otherwise made the other person aware of this Policy.</p>\n<p>You should let us know immediately if you become aware that your personal information has been provided to us by another person without your consent or if you did not obtain consent before providing another person's personal information to us.</p> 4.\nWhen we act as agent for a travel service provider <p>When we book and otherwise arrange travel related products and services for you, we usually do so as agent for or on behalf of travel service providers.\nIn this case, we usually collect personal information about you both for our internal purposes as described in this Policy, including the purpose of us processing your booking, and for the travel service provider for whom we act as agent for their internal purposes (e.g.\nto provide you with the booked services).\nAs an agent, all bookings are made on your behalf subject to the terms and conditions, including privacy policy, imposed by these travel service providers.\nWe will provide you with copies of all relevant travel service provider terms, conditions and privacy policies on request.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, you are deemed to consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us to the relevant travel service providers, and the use and disclosure of your personal information by the relevant travel service providers, for the purposes set out in this Policy and, to the extent permitted under your local data protection laws, for other purposes specified in their privacy policy.\nFor example, if you book a flight through us, then under this Policy you consent to us collecting your personal information and disclosing that information to the airline to enable your flight to be booked and for the airline to provide the flight service to you, and, to the extent permitted under your local data protection laws, for other purposes specified in their privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We act as agent for or on behalf of many thousands of travel service providers around the world, so it is not possible for us to set out in this Policy all of the travel service providers for whom we act or their locations.\nFor more information about the disclosure of personal information to travel service providers located overseas, please refer to the section below titled \u201cIs personal information transferred overseas\u201d.</p>\n<p>If you have any concerns regarding the transfer of your personal information to a travel service provider, or you wish to contact us for further information, please refer to the \u201cFeedback / Complaints / Contact\u201d section below.</p> 5.\nHow do we use and disclose your

advice and/or to assist you with booking travel and/or travel related products and services.\nHowever, the purpose for collection may differ depending on the particular circumstances as disclosed in this Policy (e.g.\ncollection of your personal information for the purpose of your participation in a competition, provision of feedback, etc).</p>\n<p>By continuing to use our services and/or by
