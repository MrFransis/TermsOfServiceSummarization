reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\nThis section describes the rights that California residents have with respect to such personal information and explains how to exercise those rights, subject in all cases to any limitations set forth in the CCPA.\nPlease refer to the section entitled \u201cWhat Information Do We Collect\u201d above for more detail about the types of information collected, the purposes for which and sources from where we collect personal information, and the third

personal information that has been de-identified or aggregated.\nFurthermore, we may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) in order to

exercise your right to know or delete, please submit a request to us by emailing us at privacy@toogoodtogo.com</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Only you, or a person or business entity registered with the California

your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nIn addition, you should provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected the personal information or an authorized representative of that person.\nFor more information about verification, see <i>Response Timing and Format</i> immediately below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Response Timing and Format.\nIn order to protect the security of your personal information, we will not honor a request if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nThe method used to verify your identity will depend on the type, sensitivity, and value of the information, including the risk of harm to you posed by any authorized access or deletion.\nGenerally speaking, verification will be performed by matching the identifying information provided by you to the personal information that we already have.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of your request (and will not be made more than twice in a 12-month period).\nIf

LEGAL RIGHTS.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nIntroduction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>TGTG \u0301s mission is to raise awareness of food waste and reduce food waste worldwide by making surplus food available for reservations by consumers.</p>\n<p>We provide a way for the Consumer to communicate his or her reservations for surplus food and other surplus products, including unspecified products in \u201cMagic Bags\u201d (\u201c<strong>Products</strong>\u201d) at Stores displayed on our Platform.</p>\n<p>These Terms apply to any reservation of Products that is carried out via our Platform.\nOur Platform is provided for your personal and non-commercial use and for informational purposes only.\nAny other use of the Services requires the prior written consent of TGTG.</p>\n<p>TGTG\u2019s cookie and privacy policy, as available at all times on the Platform, shall form an integrated part of these Terms and shall be automatically accepted upon acceptance of these Terms.\nTGTG\u2019s cookie and privacy policy are incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n<p>Any correspondence with TGTG may be submitted to TGTG via the contact page on the Platform or the App.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nTGTG Concept</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Products are made available for reservation on the Platform, and Consumers may reserve the Products by placing a Reservation Order (as defined below) on the Platform.</p>\n<p>The Products are reserved by the Consumer when TGTG confirms through a Reservation Confirmation (as defined below).</p>\n<p>Once a Consumer reserves a Product and the Store accepts the Reservation Order, the Consumer must be present at the Store at the Pick-up time (as defined below).\nBoth parties have a right of cancellation as defined below.</p>\n<p>TGTG is solely facilitating reservations of Products from a Store to a Consumer, and there shall be no contractual relationship between TGTG and the Consumer with regard to the Products or the sale of Products, which is concluded between the Store and the Consumer.\nTGTG has no responsibilities in respect of the Products or fulfillment of any reservation or agreement between the Store and the Consumer.</p>\n<p>TGTG is solely collecting the Purchase Price (as defined below) for the Products on behalf of the Store and is thus merely acting as a fulfillment and payment agent on behalf of the Store.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nAcceptance</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When placing an order on the Platform, the Consumer represents and warrants that the Consumer is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legally capable of entering into binding agreements,</li>\n<li>A consumer shopping for personal purposes,</li>\n<li>At least 18 years old and in the possession of a valid debit card, credit card or other payment means available for payment on the Platform and</li>\n<li>If Consumer is under 18 years of age, Consumer is using the Services under the supervision of an adult who is at least 18 years of age.\nIn such cases, the adult user is deemed the user of the Services.\nIf you are under age 13, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By accepting these Terms, the Consumer agrees to receive all relevant information in English.\nFurthermore, the Consumer agrees that all agreements between the Consumer and TGTG, and any related information necessary for

Consumer Service</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Too Good To Go, Inc.<br>394 Broadway, 3rd floor 10013 New York</p>\n<p>Our Consumer Service may be contacted through our contact page in the App.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nProduct and Product Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>TGTG is exclusively facilitating a Reservation of a Product between the Consumer and the Store and TGTG has no responsibilities in respect of the Products or fulfillment of any contract between the Store and the Consumer.</p>\n<p>TGTG does not, in any way, manufacture, sell, purchase, store, prepare, produce, process, mark, pack, deliver or handle the Products.\nTGTG has no responsibility for the fulfillment of any Reservation Order regarding the Products, including the manufacturing, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, marking, delivery, quality, ingredients, allergens or handling of the Products, and the compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including with respect to the above, unless TGTG is explicitly designated as the manufacturer or seller of the Product on the Platform.</p>\n<p>The Consumer can find information about the Products and a description of the Products on the Platform.\nThis information is only instructive and for the purpose of giving the Consumer the best prerequisites for evaluating selected Products before making a Reservation Order.\nThere may be instances where the Platform is not updated or where the actual product range, stocked items etc.\nis not as stated on the Platform.\nIn such cases, TGTG has no liability.\nThe Stores are responsible for providing information about the Products and ensuring that the information is factually accurate and up-to-date.\nTGTG does not have any responsibility for the information provided by the Stores and, hence, has no liability for the contents of or availability of information regarding the Products on the Platform.</p>\n<p>If the Consumer is in doubt about allergy warnings, contents of a Product or any other menu information, the Consumer shall confirm with the Store directly before conclusion of the purchase.\nThe Store\u2019s contact information will appear on the Platform.\nThe Consumer may always cancel the Reservation Order if the cancelation is due to ingredients, allergens or other labelling-related information regarding the Product.\nTGTG is not responsible for any ingredient, allergy, caloric or other nutritional information provided by the Stores or otherwise found on the Platform.\nIt is the responsibility of the Consumer and the Stores to confirm whether any allergens are present in the Products.</p>\n<p>Upon Pick-up (as defined below), the Store shall provide the Consumer with information regarding list of ingredients, allergens and other labeling-related information regarding the Product.\nAny Products purchased from a Store following a Reservation Order shall be consumed immediately after Pick-up and/or as instructed by the Product label or the Store.\nTGTG will not assume any liability for Consumers\u2019 adverse reactions from Products for any reason, including if consumed inconsistently with the labeling or the information set out in these terms or given directly by the Store.</p>\n<p>TGTG is not liable or responsible for any failure to perform or any delay in the performance of any obligations relating to the Products, including with respect to manufacturing, sale, purchase, storage, preparation, production, processing, marking, delivery, quality, ingredients, allergens or handling of the Products.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nReservation of Products</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A list of active Stores can be found on the Platform.\nIf the Consumer has allowed the Platform to use location services, the Platform will track the Consumer\u2019s location and the list will show stores near the Consumer.\nOnce the Consumer has selected the Store and Product, the Consumer will be given the opportunity to submit his or her Reservation Order by clicking \u201creserve,\u201d \u201cplace my reservation\u201d or a similar button.</p>\n<p>The list is solely established in consideration of geographical criteria.\nThe Consumer has the possibility to filter the results in consideration of the availability of Products to reserve, of the Pick-up hour, of the nature of Products contained in \u201cMagic Bags,\u201d or as otherwise determined by TGTG.</p>\n<p>The referenced Stores are the ones who are active on the Platform.</p>\n<p>The supply of Products on the Platform is only an invitation to the Consumer to place a Reservation.</p>\n<p>A Reservation Order made by the Consumer via the Platform (\u201c<strong>Reservation</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>Reservation Order</strong>\u201d) is considered an offer by the Consumer to the Store to purchase a Product.</p>\n<p>The Reservation Order shall be accepted by the Store upon Pick-up and the Reservation shall be final and binding upon the Store and Consumer upon Pick-up of the Product (as defined below), subject, however, to the limitations in the cancellation rights as described in clause 8 below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nReservation Confirmation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Upon receiving the Reservation Order, TGTG will begin processing it by sending the Reservation to the relevant Store.\nTGTG will notify the Consumer that the Reservation Order has been received (\u201c<strong>Reservation Confirmation</strong>\u201d) and is being processed.\nPlease note that any confirmation page that the Consumer may visit on the Platform merely indicates that the Reservation has been received and is being processed and does not mean that the Reservation has been accepted by the Store.</p>\n<p>The Reservation Confirmation should be saved by the Consumer.\nThe Reservation Confirmation will contain information regarding the reservation placed by the Consumer.</p>\n<p>Please note that the Reservation Confirmation does not mean that the reservation is accepted but is merely a confirmation of receipt of the Reservation Order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nRight of Cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>TGTG\u2019s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products and, therefore, if the Store has no Products in excess, the Store may cancel the Reservation Order up until two hours before the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up (as described below).\nIn this case, the Consumer will receive a cancellation notification from TGTG or the Store via email, SMS and/or the Platform provided that the contact information provided to TGTG is correct and that the Consumer has agreed to receive such notifications.</p>\n<p>Because the Products are perishable goods, and because TGTG\u2019s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products, the Consumer can only cancel the Reservation Order up until two hours before the beginning of the agreed time of Pick-up.\nHowever, the Consumer may cancel the Reservation Order until Pick-up if the cancellation is due to ingredients, allergens or other labelling related information regarding the Product.</p>\n<p>The decision to use the right of cancellation must be communicated by the Consumer to TGTG via the complaint link in the Platform.\nIf the Consumer cancels the Reservation Order outside of the parameters set out above, the Consumer will not be entitled to a refund.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nPick-up</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Products reserved on the Platform must be picked-up by the Consumer at the stated pickup address (\u201c<strong>Pick-up</strong>\u201d).\nThe Pick-up time will normally be in a time period of 10-30 minutes but can be both shorter and longer at the Store\u2019s discretion.\nStore description and details about when and where the Products can be picked up will appear on the Platform and is stated in the Reservation Confirmation as well.\nIf the Consumer arrives at the Pick-up address before the specified pick-up time, we ask him or her to please wait outside for the sake of the Store\u2019s guests.\nBe aware that if the Consumer arrives too late, the Store may be closed and/or the Product may be unavailable.</p>\n<p>Since the Products are perishable goods and since TGTG\u2019s concept is to avoid waste of food and other products, the Store is entitled to sell the Product to another Consumer if the Consumer does not Pick-up the Reservation Order within the time period set out in the Reservation Confirmation.\nIn this event, TGTG is entitled to collect the Purchase Price (as defined below) from the Consumer.</p>\n<p>Upon Pick-up, the Consumer shall show his or her Reservation Confirmation in the TGTG app to the Store\u2019s employees, after which they will \u201cswipe\u201d the receipt and hand out the Products reserved.\nIt is the Consumer\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the Reservation Confirmation in the app can be shown at Pick-up.\nThe Consumer is required to make sure that the Products ordered and number of Products handed out correspond to the Consumer\u2019s Reservation Order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nPrice</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All prices are indicated in U.S.\ncurrency and are exclusive of any applicable sales tax.</p>\n<p>Any value of the Products stated on the Platform is a minimum value had the Products not been sold as surplus food.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nPayment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Consumer can pay with several brands of debit and credit cards as well as other payment methods made available on the Platform.</p>\n<p>If using credit or debit card, the Consumer must enter his or her card number, the expiration date and the security code when placing a Reservation Order.</p>\n<p>Upon placing a Reservation Order, the price stipulated by the Store for the Products (\u201c<strong>Purchase Price</strong>\u201d) is authorized or reserved at the Consumer \u0301s account (depending on the chosen payment method) (\u201c<strong>Account</strong>\u201d).\nThe Purchase Price is charged at the Consumer \u0301s account upon reservation of the Product or at or immediately after Pick-up (depending on the chosen method of payment).\nIf the Reservation Order is cancelled in accordance with these Terms, the Purchase Price is cancelled or refunded to Consumer.</p>\n<p>The Purchase Price is collected by TGTG from the Consumer on behalf of the Store.\nTGTG may amend, modify or restructure the payment procedure for its Consumers, as it deems reasonable.</p>\n<p>The Platform uses PCI compliant Payment Service Providers.\nPayment by debit or credit card on the Platform is safe and certified by the card issuer.\nAll payments are made through an encrypted internet connection.</p>\n<p>TGTG does not store any debit or credit card information.\nSuch information is handled by the Payment Service Providers.\nHowever, such information may be stored by the Payment Service Providers.</p>\n<p>If the Consumer\u2019s credit card or payment method is rejected when trying to pay for a Reservation Order, the Consumer should verify that the entered information is correct.</p>\n<p>If the Consumer has corrected the error and the credit card is still rejected, TGTG recommends that the Consumer contact his or her bank.</p>\n<p>Due to standard banking procedures, once the Consumer has submitted a Reservation Order by use of a credit or debit card and the payment has been authorized, the bank or card issuer will reserve the full amount of the Reservation Order.\nIf the Reservation Order is subsequently rejected by the Store or cancelled for any other reason in accordance with these Terms, the bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the order to TGTG and will instead refund the Consumer by releasing the relevant amount back into the Consumer\u2019s available balance.\nHowever, this may take up to 10 working days (or longer, depending on the Consumer\u2019s bank or card issuer), and TGTG does not have the authority to make inquiries to a Consumer\u2019s bank or card issuer on specific payment issues.\nThe Consumer must do so.</p>\n<p>By accepting these Terms, the Consumer accepts the method of payment set out above and acknowledges and agrees that TGTG is not responsible or liable to the Consumer in relation to the above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nRight of Complaint</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In case of a complaint concerning a Product (including a \u201cMagic Bag\u201d and its contents), the Consumer shall address the complaints to Consumer Service of TGTG before taking any other action.\nTGTG will handle all claims (including with respect to a \u201cMagic Bag\u201d and its contents) as TGTG deems correct and any decision by TGTG regarding the Product is entirely up to TGTG.</p>\n<p>In the event that the intervention of TGTG is not to the satisfaction of the Consumer, these Terms do not limit the means available to the Consumer to resolve the dispute it has with the Store under applicable law.</p>\n<p>All complaints are handled exclusively by TGTG and the Consumer shall direct complaints to TGTG and not the Store.</p>\n<p>The Consumer shall verify the content of the Products upon receipt.</p>\n<p>In case of a complaint, the Consumer shall contact TGTG via the complaint link on the Platform and provide the requested information, including information about the Product at issue and why the Consumer is unsatisfied.\nAfter receiving the complaint, TGTG will process the complaint, in cooperation with the Store if relevant, and the Consumer will receive a reply from TGTG within 10 business days.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nConsumer Behavior/Rules of Conduct</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Consumers are requested to show respect for a Store \u0301s guests and personnel, as well as TGTG \u0301s personnel.</p>\n<p>The Consumer is informed that in case of inappropriate behavior towards a Store, the other Consumers of a Store or TGTG, or if the Consumer commits a crime against or in a Store in connection with the Services, or violates the code of conduct rules of a Store or TGTG or any other similar behavior, TGTG may, in particular after complaints made by a Store, ban, exclude or suspend the Consumer from the Platform and the Services.\nThe intervention of TGTG does not deprive a Store of the means and rights at its disposal to obtain possible reparations.</p> Rules of Conduct for
