consumer service department is available to address any concerns you may have regarding the Services.\nYou may contact them by phone at 1-800-255-3700, by email at useragreement@noa.nintendo.com, or by regular mail sent to Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: Terms of Use, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.\nMost matters are quickly resolved in this manner to our customer\u2019s satisfaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Any matter we are unable to resolve and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Services (each, a \"<strong>Claim</strong>\"), with the exception of the matters described in section 13(d) below, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the \"<strong>AAA</strong>\"), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Claims.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they may have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nANY SUCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED BY THE PARTIES IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this Section 13 shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1.800.778.7879.\nTo the extent the initial filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial filing fee for a lawsuit, we will pay the difference in fees.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim is less than $75,000.\nThe arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney\u2019s fees in certain cases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Section 13(b) does not apply to any Claim (i) in which a party is attempting to protect its intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights), or (ii) that may be brought in small claims court.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section 13 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: CS Admin, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 within 30 days of the start of your use of the Services.\nIf you send this notice, then Section 13 will not apply to either party.\nIf you do not send this notice, then you agree to be bound by this Section 13.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You and Nintendo agree that the state or federal courts in King County, Washington have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration.\nAny dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of Washington and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Miscellaneous.\n<p>If any part of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that part will be severed from these Terms, and the rest of the Terms will remain intact.\nIf we do not enforce any provision of these Terms, that will not be considered a waiver of our rights.\nAny waiver of these Terms must be obtained in a written document signed by an authorized representative of Nintendo.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Changes to these Terms <p>We may change these Terms from time to time.\nIf we do, we\u2019ll provide notice of any changes, such as by posting the most recent version on our Services and updating the \"Last Updated\" date above.\nYou can view the latest Terms any time by clicking the \"Terms of Use\" link at the bottom of the applicable webpage.\nWe encourage you to check for updates regularly.\nYour continued use of the Services following any notice we provide will confirm that you have agreed to the amended Terms.\nIf you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li> About Nintendo <ul>\n<li>Company Info</li>\n<li>Careers</li>\n<li>CSR Report</li>\n<li>Sitemap</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Where To Buy

(collectively, \"Covered Losses\") as a result of your use of any of the Nintendo Account Services, or any data, information, or other item you make available through the Nintendo Account Services, then you agree to indemnify us from all such Covered Losses and any related costs, such as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p>Some jurisdictions limit consumer indemnities, so some or all of the indemnity provisions above may not apply to you.\nIf you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.</p> 15.\nDisclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability <p>USE OF THE NINTENDO ACCOUNT SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.\nNO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NINTENDO WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS, USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE NINTENDO ACCOUNT SERVICES,

ACCOUNT SERVICES IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAID FOR THE NINTENDO ACCOUNT SERVICES.\nIF A LAW RESTRICTS OUR ABILITY TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR DISCLAIM WARRANTIES, THE LIMITATIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIN THAT CASE, WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY AND DISCLAIM WARRANTIES TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p> 16.\nDispute Resolution.\nBinding Arbitration.\nClass Action Waiver <p>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>\n<p>BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT YOU AND NINTENDO EXPRESSLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>a.\nOur Contact Center is available to address any concerns you may have regarding your Nintendo Account and the Nintendo Account Services.\nYou may contact them by phone at 1-800-255-3700, by email at useragreement@noa.nintendo.com, or by regular mail sent to Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: User Agreement, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.\nMost matters are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers\u2019 satisfaction.\nAny matter we are unable to resolve and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to the Nintendo Account Services or this Agreement, including its formation, enforceability, performance, or breach (each, a \"Claim\"), with the exception of the matters described in Section 16(c) below, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the \"AAA\"), excluding any AAA rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions or class arbitrations.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Claims.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nThe parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nAny such arbitration shall be conducted by the parties in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class-action waiver set forth in the preceding sentence is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth in this Section shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate Claims.</p>\n<p>b.\nThe rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879.\nTo the extent the initial filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the initial filing fee for a lawsuit, we will pay the difference in fees.\nIf the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, we will pay all of the actual filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim is less than $75,000.\nThe arbitration rules also permit you to recover attorney\u2019s fees in certain cases.</p>\n<p>c.\nSection 16(a) does not apply to any Claim (i) in which a party is attempting to protect its intellectual property rights (such as its patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights, but not including its privacy or publicity rights), or (ii) that may be brought in small-claims court, in each case solely to the extent that any such Claim is not styled in the form of a class action litigation.</p>\n<p>d.\n30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section 16 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Nintendo of America Inc., Attn: CS Admin, 4600 150th Ave NE, Redmond, WA 98052 within 30 days from the date you created your Nintendo Account.\nSuch notice must include the name of each person opting out, contact information, and the email address registered to your Nintendo Account.\nIf you send timely written notice containing the required information, then Section 16 will not apply to you or Nintendo.\nIf you do not send such notice, then you agree to be bound by this Section 16.</p> 17.\nSeverability <p>If any part of this Agreement is determined to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that part will be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of the Agreement will remain intact.\nIf we do not enforce any provision of this Agreement, that will not be considered a waiver of our rights.\nAny waiver of this Agreement must be in a written document signed by an authorized representative of Nintendo.</p> 18.\nGoverning Law.\nVenue <p>The laws of the State of Washington, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, will govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort pertaining to this Agreement or the Nintendo Account Services that might arise between you and Nintendo.</p>\n<p>The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in King County, Washington, U.S.A.\nwith respect to the resolution of either of the following: (a) an allegation by either party that Section 16 is invalid or unenforceable or (b) any Claims, following (i) any opt out from the provisions of Section 16 exercised in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 16(d) or (ii) a final determination that Section 16 is invalid or unenforceable.</p> 19.\nContact Information <p>If you wish to contact Nintendo concerning the Nintendo Account Services, you may use the contact information provided at here.</p> 20.\nCustomers Using Smart Device Operating Systems from Apple, Inc.\n<p>This Section 20 applies to users who use any Nintendo Account Services on smart device operating systems provided by Apple, Inc.\n(hereinafter \"Apple\").\nIn the event of conflict between this Section 20 and the Agreement, this Section 20 shall apply.</p>\n<p>a.\nNintendo grants a license to you only, for the nonexclusive, nonassignable right to download and use the Nintendo Account Services for your personal, noncommercial purposes,

Services.</p>\n<p>d.\nThe Nintendo Account Services are provided by Nintendo Co., Ltd., headquartered at 11-1 Hokotate-cho, Kamitoba, Minami-ku, Kyoto 601-8501, Japan.\nPlease see Section 19 of this Agreement for contact information concerning the Nintendo Account Services.</p>\n<p>e.\nYou represent and warrant that you do not live in a US export-embargoed country or a country designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the United States government and that you are not on the list of people barred or excluded from the United States.</p>\n<p>f.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple and

acknowledged the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as third-party beneficiary.</p> END <ul>\n<li>Official Nintendo Website</li>\n<li>Nintendo Account User Agreement</li>\n<li>Nintendo
