state the nature of your emergency and provide both your location and phone number, as the operator may not automatically receive this information.&nbsp;<b>Mint Mobile is not responsible for failures to connect or complete 9-1-1 calls or if inaccurate location information is provided.\n9-1-1 service may not be available or reliable and your ability to receive emergency services may be impeded.&nbsp;</b>We or our network supplier may use a variety of information and methods to determine the location of a 9-1-1 call, including Global Positioning Satellites, our network supplier\u2019s wireless network, the street address you have provided us as your primary use location (\u201cPrimary Address\u201d), or other information.\nEven with this information, an emergency operator may not be able to locate you in order to provide emergency services.\nOther third party entities are involved in connecting a 9-1-1 call and neither Mint Mobile nor its network supplier determines the public safety agency to which your 9-1-1 call is routed.\nIf you are porting a phone number to or from us, we may not be able to provide you with some Services, such as 9-1-1 location services, while the port is being implemented.\nIf you are porting a phone number to us, it is your obligation and responsibility to make certain that all information forwarded from the port out carrier is accurate and complete.\nIf you dial 9-1-1 while outside the U.S., 9-1-1 services may not be available.</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nService Plans.</b>\n</p>\n<p>8.1&nbsp;<i>General.&nbsp;</i>Your Service will operate only after you have purchased and redeemed a Mint Mobile Service plan.\nWe may offer plans that can only be activated through the Mint mobile application (each, a\u201cTrial Plan\u201d).\nTrial Plan access to the Mint Mobile service will cease according to the specific terms of your Trial Plan.\nTrial Plans are not renewable and you must become a paid subscriber to the Mint Mobile service in order to continue your access to the Mint Mobile service.\nFor certain Trial Plans, you may only be able to transfer your mobile phone number from your existing carrier when you purchase a standard Mint Mobile service plan.\nVisit our website located at mintmobile.com for specific details.\nMint will not transfer phone numbers from Trial Plans to a new carrier.\nIf you have activated any Trial Plan, you will not be able to transfer the phone number associated with that Trial Plan to a new carrier unless you convert your Trial Plan to a three, six, or twelve month plan.\nFor all other Mint Mobile service plans, airtime expiration is subject to the terms of your plan.\nYour account may be canceled if your account balance remains at $0 for 60 consecutive calendar days or more.\nTo ensure uninterrupted service, you are required to renew your account before your airtime expires.\nPlease visit our website located at mintmobile.com for the latest information regarding our Service plans and Trial Plans.</p>\n<p>8.2&nbsp;<i>Charges.</i>\n<b>&nbsp;You agree to pay all charges we bill you or that were accepted or processed through your Device.</b> All Mint Service plans are measured on a 30-day cycle, except that 12-month plans are measured on 31-day cycles in even numbered months.\nWe may offer you the opportunity to set up automatic payments through the method of payment on your account will be automatically charged at the end of your applicable billing cycle (\u201cAuto Renew\u201d).\nWhen you enroll in Auto Renew, automatic payments for plan fees that you incur will continue until you cancel.\nThe recurring charge may vary if you change your plan or we change our prices, following notice to you.\nYou may cancel Auto Renew or review your payment preferences at any time by (i) contacting our customer service department at (800) 683 7392, or (iii) managing your account preferences on the Mint Mobile website.\nYou must change your Auto Renew preferences or cancel 24 hours prior to the end of your billing cycle in order for the change to go into effect.\nNo minimum purchase is necessary to enroll in Auto Renew.\nFor disputed charges, see Section 11.\nYou agree to provide us with accurate and complete billing information and to immediately report to us all changes to your billing information.</p>\n<p>8.3&nbsp;<i>Voice Usage.</i>&nbsp;Mint Mobile Service plans include a voice plan as part of your Service.\nWe round up any fraction of a minute to the next full minute.\nAirtime usage is measured from the time the network provider begins to process a call (before the phone rings or the call is answered) through its termination of the call (after you hang up) and the network disconnects.</p>\n<p>8.4&nbsp;<i>Data Usage and Messaging.</i>&nbsp;Mint Mobile Service plans include a data plan (\u201cData Plan\u201d) as part of your Service.\nData usage is rounded up to the next full-kilobyte increment at the end of each data session.\nYour data usage includes, among other things, text, web browsing, instant or picture messages, and email whether read or unread, sent or received, solicited or unsolicited.\nWe use filters to block spam messages, but we do not guarantee that you will not receive spam or other unsolicited messages, and we are not liable for such messages.&nbsp.\nAll data purchased through a Mint Mobile Service plan (both data that comes with a particular Mint Mobile Service plan and any additional data you purchase as an add-on), will expire immediately upon termination of your Mint Mobile Service plan for any reason.</p>\n<p>8.5&nbsp;<i>Permissible and Prohibited Uses.&nbsp;</i>Your Data Plan is intended for Web browsing, messaging, and similar activities on your Device and not on any other equipment.\nOther uses, including for example, using your Device as a modem or tethering your Device to a personal computer or other hardware, may be permitted under your Data Plan, but are also subject to our Acceptable Use Policy located at&nbsp;mintmobile.com/acceptable-use-policy.\nExamples of prohibited uses can be found in Section 14 of these T&amp;Cs and in our Acceptable Use Policy.</p>\n<p>8.6&nbsp;<i>Data Usage Level.</i>&nbsp;Mint Mobile has set a 30-day 4G, 4G LTE and 5G data usage level (\u201cUsage Level\u201d) for each of the Mint Mobile Service plans.\nOur network supplier measures your upload and download data usage (\u201cActual Usage\u201d) to determine if your total Actual Usage, as aggregated over the applicable 30-day period (\u201cUsage Total\u201d), exceeds the 30-day 4G, 4G LTE and 5G Usage Level for the Service plan you selected.\nPlease note that \u201cActual Usage\u201d includes all of your requests to upload or download data, whether or not such data is actually uploaded or downloaded, as well as network overhead.\nFor example, if you request that an image be downloaded to your Device or your Mobile HotSpot (tethering), but travel outside of your network coverage area before the download is complete, such request will be included in your Actual Usage even though the image was never downloaded to your Device.\nIf you purchased a Service plan that includes 3, 8, or 12GB of data in a 30-day Service period and you exceed your Service plan\u2019s 30-day Usage Level for high-speed data, Mint Mobile will reduce the data speeds to 128 kbps until the end of the applicable 30-day period.\nIf you purchased a Service plan that includes unlimited data and you exceed your Service plan\u2019s 30-day Usage Level of 35GB of high-speed data, Mint Mobile will reduce the speed at which you can send and receive data over the Mint Mobile network to 128 kbps until the end of the applicable 30-day period.\nThe initial reduction in your data speed depends upon your Service plan and can be found in the Mint Mobile FAQs.\nIf you continue to send and/or receive a substantial amount of data (as determined by Mint Mobile in its sole discretion) after our initial reduction of your data speed, we may further reduce your data speed to 64 kbps.\nOnce you begin a new 30-day period in your Service plan, your Service plan Usage Level will be reset and your upload and download speeds will be restored.\nPlease be aware that your Usage Level is much more likely to exceed your Service plan\u2019s 30-day Usage Level if you use streaming video, a Mobile HotSpot (tethering), or if you download significant quantities of music files, movies, software applications, or engage in other high-bandwidth activities.</p>\n<p>8.7&nbsp;<i>Protective Measures.</i>&nbsp;To provide a good experience for the majority of our customers and minimize capacity issues and degradation in network performance, we may take measures including temporarily reducing data throughput for a subset of customers who use a disproportionate amount of bandwidth.\nIf you use your Data Plan in a manner that could interfere with other customers\u2019 service, affect our ability to allocate network capacity among customers, or degrade service quality for other customers, we may suspend, terminate, or restrict your data session, prioritize on-Device over Mobile HotSpot (tethering) traffic, or switch you to a more appropriate Data Plan which may result in an increased cost.\nWe also manage our network to facilitate the proper functioning of services that require consistent high speeds, such as video calling, which may, particularly at times and in areas of network congestion, result in reduced speeds for other services.\nAdditionally, we may implement other network management practices, such as caching less data, using less capacity, sizing video more appropriately for a Device to transmit data files more efficiently, and deploying streaming video optimization technology.\nStreaming video optimization technology is intended to manage data usage on the network, reduce the risk of streaming video stalling and buffering, and reduce the amount of high-speed data consumption used for streaming video.\nStreaming video optimization improves streaming video reliability as well as makes room for other users to enjoy higher browsing speeds.\nThe streaming video optimization process is agnostic as to the streaming video content itself and to the website that provides it, however, we may prioritize on-Device data over Mobile HotSpot (tethering) data.\nWhile most changes to streaming video files are likely to be indiscernible, the optimization process may minimally impact the appearance of the streaming video as displayed on your Device.\nThese practices operate without regard to the content itself or the source of the content, and do not discriminate against offerings that might compete against those offered by us on the basis of such competition.</p>\n<p>8.8&nbsp;<i>Wi-Fi Features.&nbsp;</i>Mint Mobile, at its sole discretion, may make available Wi-Fi voice and text messaging services, i.e., the ability to originate and terminate calls and text messages over a Wi-Fi connection (\u201cWi-Fi Calling).\nIf offered by Mint Mobile, Wi-Fi Calling will only be available for Mint Mobile customers that (i) have a Wi-Fi capable Mint Mobile Device with Mint Mobile supported Wi-Fi calling capability, (ii) have Wi-Fi Calling service provisioned on their account, (iii) have a compatible SIM card, and (iv) are connected to functioning third-party internet service.\nNot all services available on Mint Mobile\u2019s supplier\u2019s network are available while using Wi-Fi Calling.\nFor example, emergency alerts may not be available with Wi-Fi Calling.\nYou acknowledge that calling 9-1-1 via Wi-Fi Calling uses the internet and operates differently than traditional 9-1-1 (see our complete 9-1-1 disclosure posted on the Mint Mobile website at&nbsp;mintmobile.com/911-disclosure).\nFor example, 9-1-1 may not work during power or internet outages or disruptions, or if internet or your Service is suspended.\nLocation information when using Wi-Fi Calling may be limited or unavailable.\nIf Mint Mobile makes Wi-Fi Calling available to you, you must provide us with your up-to-date, primary address.\nIf the location at which you primarily use Wi-Fi Calling changes, either temporarily or permanently, you must promptly update your address with Mint Mobile.\nYou may provide us with your primary address, or update your primary address, by contacting us at the email address, telephone number or mailing address specified in Section 12.\nIf you do not provide us with your primary address and update it promptly as described above, we or our network supplier may block your usage of certain Wi-Fi Networks.\nWhen you call 9-1-1 over Wi-Fi away from your primary address, we and our network supplier may have no or very limited information about your location.&nbsp;<b>NEITHER MINT MOBILE NOR ITS NETWORK SUPPLIER IS RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANYTHING RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY WI-FI CALLING MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY FAILURE OF EMERGENCY CALLS (WHETHER 9-1-1 CALLS OR OTHERWISE).&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Wi-Fi Calling may decrement Service plan minutes.&nbsp.\nMost devices will not transition between Wi-Fi and the wireless network.&nbsp.\nDevices using wireless connections may be vulnerable to unauthorized attempts to access data and software stored on the device.</p>\n<p>8.9&nbsp;<i>Downloadable Content and Applications.</i>&nbsp;Content or applications (e.g.,

&amp.\nApps provider or some other third party.\nIf you access or use any Content &amp.\nApps through the Mint Mobile Service, you agree and authorize Mint Mobile and its network carrier to provide information related to such use.\nYou understand that your use of a third-party app is subject to the third party\u2019s terms and conditions and policies, including its privacy policy.\nPlease refer to the Content &amp.\nApps creator/owner\u2019s privacy policy for information regarding their use of information collected when you download, install, or use any third-party Content &amp.\nApps.\nWe are not responsible for any transmission failure, interruption, or delay related to Content &amp.\nApps, or any content or website you may be able to access through the Content

Device to determine if you are Roaming.\nThere may be extra charges (including long distance, tolls, data usage) and higher rates for Roaming usage, and your quality and availability of service may vary significantly.\nOur Roaming charges and rates are subject to change at any time and any such changes are effective forty-five (45) days after the posting of same to the Mint Mobile website.\nPlease check our website frequently so that you are aware of our Roaming charges and rates and any changes thereto.</p>\n<p>8.12 <i>Suspension and Cancellation.</i> If your account is deactivated due to nonpayment, your account will be in a suspended status for 60 days.\nIf your account is not reactivated within the 60-day period, it will be cancelled.\nIf your account is cancelled, your remaining balance will be forfeited and we may reassign the phone number associated with your account.\nIf you wish to port to a different carrier, you must have an active account.</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.\nInternational Long Distance / Global Text.&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>General.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>All international long-distance services included in your Service are

international roaming minutes or data without additional charge.\nThe amount of Credits that you receive in connection with your Service plan may be determined by us in our sole discretion, and additional details are available on our website.\nMint Mobile may allow you to store Credits in your account for use at a later time.\nWhen your balance of Credits is zero, unless you add Credits to your account, you will not be able to use international roaming Service.\nPlease be aware that except as provided by these T&amp;Cs, Mint Mobile will be under no obligation to offer any refunds or reimbursements for Credits that you receive from Mint Mobile.\nCredits will be reclaimed by us should your account be terminated for any reason.</p>\n<p>9.3 <i>International texts</i>.\n\u201cGlobal Text\u201d and \u201cUnlimited Global Text\u201d means text or unlimited text only to applicable mobile-to-mobile destinations, and excludes audio, picture, and video messaging.&nbsp.\nData usage rates and charges may apply if you send audio, pictures, and/or video messages to an international mobile-to-mobile destination.</p>\n<p>\n<b>10.\nTaxes, Fees and Surcharges.</b>&nbsp;You are responsible for, and shall pay, the taxes, fees and surcharges set forth in Sections 10.1 \u2013 10.5 below (\u201cTaxes, Fees and Surcharges\u201d) in connection with your Service account.\nSuch Taxes, Fees and Surcharges will be included in your Service account charges (a) at the time you order the Service and (b) each time there are any further charges to your Service account.\nPayment of Taxes, Fees and Surcharges is in addition to payment for the Service and will be billed to your credit card.</p>\n<p>10.1&nbsp;<i>Recovery Fee.</i>&nbsp;The Recovery Fee is assessed to help recover Mint Mobile\u2019s costs to comply with various federal and state programs, taxes and fees including, but not limited to, (i) state and federal Telecommunications Relay Service Programs, (ii) Federal Universal Service Fund Program, (iii) international, federal, state, municipal, local and/or other governmental franchise, excise, public utility and other telecommunications taxes, fees and charges now in force or enacted in the future, and (iv) other costs we incur to comply with government regulations and programs, which are not taxes or fees that local, state or federal governments require Mint Mobile to collect.\nFor 3GB, 8GB and 12GB plans the Recovery Fee is calculated as a flat fee of $1.25 for a one-month plan.\n$3.75 for a 3-month plan.\n$6.75 for a 6-month plan.\nand $11.75 for a 12-month plan.\nFor the \u201cUnlimited data\u201d plan, the Recovery Fee is calculated as a flat fee of $5.50 for a 3-month plan.\n$8.75 for a 6-month plan.\nand $16.25 for a 12-month plan.\nA flat per transaction fee ($0.50 for service charges of $10.00 or less and $1.00 for service charges of $10.01 or more) may apply for non-plan service purchases (e.g., 4G LTE/5G data add-ons).\nA flat fee per transaction of 2.5% will also be applied to help recover other administrative fees.\nAlthough added to the overall charge, the Recovery Fee is separate from the cost of Service and the Recovery Fee shall not result in the purchase of any additional Service time.\nWe set the Recovery Fee, and the amount and what the Recovery Fee includes may change without notice.</p>\n<p>10.2&nbsp;<i>Federal Universal Service Fund Fee.</i>&nbsp;The Federal Universal Service Fund Fee is designed to recover Mint Mobile\u2019s contribution to the Federal Universal Service Fund program.\nThe Federal Universal Service Fund Fee is used to fund programs to increase access to advanced telecommunications services for consumers in rural areas at reasonable rates and provides federal program funding.\nRate may change as determined by the Federal Communications Commission.\nThe Universal Service Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d) establishes a quarterly contribution factor, and Mint Mobile charges its customers the then-applicable rate charged to Mint Mobile by USAC.</p>\n<p>10.3&nbsp;<i>State Universal Service Fund Fees.</i>&nbsp.\nThe State Universal Service Fund Fee is designed to recover Mint Mobile\u2019s contribution to various state universal service fund programs.\nThe State Universal Service Fund Fee is assessed as a percentage of intrastate revenues, gross revenues, or as a flat rate per line&nbsp;as set forth by the various state, county or municipal jurisdiction.\nCertain state agencies establish a quarterly, semi-annual or annual contribution factor, and Mint Mobile may choose to charge its customers to recoup the state universal service fund fees charged to Mint Mobile.</p>\n<p>10.4&nbsp;<i>Sales and Use Taxes.</i>&nbsp;Sales and use taxes are assessed to allow Mint Mobile to recover the cost of all federal, state, municipal, local or other governmental sales and use taxes now in force or enacted in the future, that arise as a result of your subscription to, use of, or payment for Mint Mobile Service.\nTo determine sales and use taxes, we will use the street address you identified as your Place of Primary Use (\u201cPPU\u201d).\nThe PPU for Puerto Rico must be in Puerto Rico.\nIf you did not identify the correct PPU, or if you provided an address (such as a PO box) that is not a recognized street address, does not identify the applicable taxing jurisdictions
