\u201c<strong>Company</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>Storj</strong>\u201d \u201c<strong>we</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>us</strong>,\u201d or \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201d).\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all websites owned and operated by us that link to this Privacy Policy (the \u201c<strong>Sites</strong>\u201d), Storj\u2019s online storage services and applications, and related online and offline services (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201d).\nThe Services enable customers to store data on third-party devices that have installed an open source, distributed storage software (\u201c<strong>Software</strong>\u201d).\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to the information other devices that have installed the Software may collect about you or your device in connection with your use of the Software.\n</p>\n<p>Storj is a network and service provider that provides decentralized cloud storage by connecting those seeking to store data (\u201c<strong>Customers</strong>\u201d) with those providing space for cloud storage (\u201c<strong>Node Operators</strong>\u201d) (the \u201c<strong>Storage Services</strong>\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>Data submitted by Customers to the Services for storage with Node Operators (\u201c<strong>Storage Materials</strong>\u201d) is encrypted, which prevents Storj and Node Operators from accessing the content of the Storage Materials.\nStorj acts as a service provider/processor of Storage Materials on behalf of itsCustomers.\nIndividuals whose data may be included in Storage Materials ultimately are subject to the privacy policies and practices of the Customer utilizing Storj for Storage Services.\nAccordingly, for the purposes of the European Union (\u201c<strong>EU</strong>\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (\u201c<strong>GDPR</strong>\u201d), Customers act as the data controller with respect to the processing of the Storage Materials.\nStorj is not responsible for the privacy practices of Customers.\nStorj acts as the data controller and not a processor/service provider when, for example, Customers, Node Operators, and other Site visitors provide Storj with information, such as contact, account, and registration information.</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HANDLE YOUR INFORMATION.\nBy using the Services, you expressly and voluntarily are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use (and other applicable agreements, such as the Storj DCS CustomerTerms of Service, and Node Operator Terms

help grow our business.</p>\n<p>Third-party tools in use outside of our site and satellite interface include Google Analytics and Customer.io.\nGoogle Analytics is currently in use in our

CCPA, however, must provide California residents with some additional information regarding the collection, use, and sharing of \u201cpersonal information\u201d as defined in the CCPA.\nAlthough Storj currently is not subject to the CCPA, we voluntarily are providing certain additional information below for informational purposes only:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Source, Use, and Disclose Information

California residents upon request.\nSpecifically, the CCPA would allow California residents to request us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inform them about the categories of personal information we collect or disclose about them.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting their personal information.\nand, the categories of third parties with whom we share/disclose personal information.\n</li>\n<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain personal information we hold about them.</li>\n<li>Delete certain personal information we have about them.</li>\n<li>Provide them with information about the financial incentives that we offer to them, if any.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The CCPA exempts certain information from some requests including, for example, a company may need certain information to provide the requested services or to comply with a legal obligation.\nIn some circumstances if the consumer still asks for their information to be deleted, they may no longer be able to access or use the services offered.\nNotwithstanding, the CCPA protects a person making a request under the law to be free from discrimination for exercising their rights.</p>\n<p>Companies subject to the CCPA should take reasonable steps to verify the consumer\u2019s identity before responding to a request, including by asking for verification information to match at least two verification points with information already on file.\nIf the consumer can\u2019t be verified this way, a company has the right, but not the obligation, to request additional information from the consumer.\nThe CCPA also permits consumers to designate an authorized agent to submit certain requests on their behalf.\nThe authorized agent must have signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney, and may be subject to additional verification before the authorized agent\u2019s request is processed.\n</p>\n<p>As noted above, Storage Materials are encrypted, which prevents Storj and Node Operators from accessing the encrypted data.\nIf the CCPA applies, any person who wishes to access or delete personal information within Storage Materials must send their queries to the relevant Customer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>California \u201cShine the Light\u201d Disclosure</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The California \u201cShine the Light\u201d law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to opt out of the sharing of certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\n<strong>Storj\u2019s policy and practice is to never share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</strong> Accordingly, there is no need for Storj consumers to opt out.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\n&nbsp;Additional Information for Nevada Residents</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Under Nevada law, certain Nevada residents may opt out of the \u201csale\u201d of \u201ccovered information\u201d (as those terms are defined under Nevada law) where the sale allows the person buying it to license or sell such information to additional persons.\n\u201cCovered information\u201d includes first and last name, address, email address, phone number, social security number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or
