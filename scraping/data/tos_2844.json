engine).\nThis document also describes the controls available to you regarding how your data is used by Chrome.\nHere we\u2019re focusing on the desktop version of Chrome.\nwe touch only tangentially on Chrome OS and Chrome for Mobile.\nThis document does not cover features that are still under development, such as features in the beta, dev and canary channel and active field trials, or Android apps on Chrome OS if Play Apps are enabled.\n</p>\n<p>If you have a question about Google Chrome and Privacy that this document doesn\u2019t answer, please feel free to ask it in the Community Forum.\nIf you want to report a privacy issue, you can file it in our public bug tracker.\nFor issues that include confidential information, please use this link.\nWe\u2019d be happy to hear from you.\n</p> Omnibox <p>Google Chrome uses a combined web address and search bar (we call it the \u201comnibox\u201d) at the top of the browser window.\n</p>\n<p>As you use the omnibox, your default search engine can suggest addresses and search queries that may be of interest to you.\nThese suggestions make navigation and searching faster and easier, and are turned on by default.\nThey can be turned off by unchecking \"Autocomplete searches and URLs\" in the \u201cSync and Google services\u201d section of Chrome's settings.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>When not in Incognito mode, in order to provide these suggestions, Chrome sends the text you've typed into the omnibox, along with a general categorization (e.g., \"URL\", \"search query\", or \"unknown\"), to your default search engine.\nChrome will also send a signal to your default search engine when you focus in the omnibox, telling it to get ready to provide suggestions.\nThat signal includes the URL of the currently displayed search engine results page.\nYour IP address and certain cookies are also sent to your default search engine with all requests, in order to return the results that are most relevant to you.\n</p>\n<p>To provide suggestions and search results faster, Chrome may preconnect to your default search engine in the background.\nChrome will not preconnect if you have either turned off \u201cPreload pages for faster browsing and searching\u201d in the \u201cCookies\u201d part of \u201cPrivacy and security\u201d section or \"Autocomplete searches and URLs\" in the \u201cSync and Google services\u201d section of Chrome's settings.\nWhen Chrome preconnects, it resolves the search engine\u2019s IP address and connects it to the search engine, exposing your IP address.\n</p>\n<p>When in Incognito mode, in order to provide these suggestions, Chrome relies on an on-device model that does not communicate with your default search engine until you select a suggestion.\n</p>\n<p>If Chrome determines that your typing may contain sensitive information, such as authentication credentials, local file names, or URL data that is normally encrypted, it will not send the typed text.\n</p>\n<p>If Google is your default search engine, when you select one of the omnibox suggestions, Chrome sends your original search query, the suggestion you selected, and the position of the suggestion back to Google.\nThis information helps improve the quality of the suggestion feature, and it's logged and anonymized in the same manner as Google web searches.\nLogs of these suggestion requests are retained for two weeks, after which 2% of the log data is randomly selected, anonymized, and retained in order to improve the suggestion feature.\n</p>\n<p>If you've chosen to sync your Chrome history, and if Google is your default search engine, the URL of the page you\u2019re viewing is sent to Google in order to provide better, contextually relevant suggestions.\nURLs are sent only for HTTP pages and HTTPS pages, not other schemes such as file: and ftp:.\nAdditionally, Chrome may present website and search query suggestions as soon as you place the cursor in the omnibox, before you start typing.\nChrome is in the process of transitioning to a new service to provide these on-focus suggestions.\nFor most users on desktop versions of Chrome, the request and complete set of suggestions are retained on Google servers in order to further improve and personalize the feature.\nWhen the URL that triggered the set of suggestions is deleted from your history, the set of suggestions will stop influencing suggestions personalized to you, and will be deleted.\notherwise they are retained in your Google account for a year.\nFor a small portion of users on desktop versions of Chrome, and users on mobile versions of Chrome, the logging described in the previous paragraphs apply except that URLs are never included in the 2% sampling of log data.\n</p>\n<p>On Android, your location will also be sent to Google via an X-Geo HTTP request header if Google is your default search engine, the Chrome app has the permission to use your geolocation, and you haven\u2019t blocked geolocation for www.google.com (or country-specific origins such as www.google.de).\nAdditionally, if your device has network location enabled (High Accuracy or Battery Saving Device Location mode in Android settings), the X-Geo header may also include visible network IDs (WiFi and Cell), used to geocode the request server-side.\nThe X-Geo header will never be sent in Incognito mode.\nHTTPS will be required to include this header in the request.\nYou can learn more about how to control the Android OS location sharing with apps on this article for Nexus, or find your device here if you do not use a Nexus.\nHow to control location sharing with a site within Chrome is written in this article.\nSee the Geolocation section of this whitepaper for more information on default geolocation permissions.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, if Google is your default search engine and you have enabled sync, omnibox may also show suggestions for your Google Drive files.\nYou can turn this functionality off by disabling the \u201cDrive suggestions\u201d option in the \u201cSync and Google services\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings.\n</p>\n<p>If you use a non-Google search provider as your default search engine, queries are sent and logged under that provider's privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, when you use the omnibox to search for a single word, Chrome may send this word to your DNS server to see whether it corresponds to a host on your network, and may try to connect to the corresponding host.\nThis gives you the option to navigate to that host instead of searching.\nFor example, if your router goes by the hostname \u201crouter\u201d, and you type \u201crouter\u201d in the omnibox, you\u2019re given the option to navigate to https://router/, as well as to search for the word \u201crouter\u201d with your default search provider.\nThis feature is not controlled by the \"Use a prediction service to help complete searches and URLs...\" option because it does not involve sending data to your default search engine.\n</p> Network predictions <p>Chrome uses a service to predict which resources and pages are likely to be needed next in order to load pages more quickly.\nThe prediction service uses navigation history, local heuristics, and data learned from Google\u2019s search crawlers.\nRetrieving the data from Google's crawlers requires sending the URL of the current page to Google, and so it is only used if you\u2019ve opted into \"Make Searches and Browsing Better (Sends URLs of the pages you visit to Google)\" and/or enabled Lite Mode.\nThe prediction service may initiate actions such as DNS prefetching, TCP and TLS preconnection, and prefetching of web pages.\nTo turn off network predictions, uncheck \u201cPreload pages for faster browsing and searching\u201d in the \u201cPrivacy and security &gt.\nCookies\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings on desktop, in the \u201cPrivacy\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings on Android, and in the \u201cBandwidth\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings on iOS.\n</p>\n<p>To improve load times, the browser can be asked to prefetch links that you might click next.\nChrome supports five types of prefetching: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome prefetching - can be initiated by Chrome itself whenever it detects a search query typed in the omnibox, a likely beginning of a URL you type often in the omnibox, or when you have Lite mode enabled and are visiting Google Search.\n</li>\n<li>Webpage prefetching - requested by one web page to prefetch another </li>\n<li>AMP prefetching - can be requested only by the Google Search App on Android to prefetch several accelerated mobile pages (AMP) articles and display them later in a Chrome Custom Tab </li>\n<li>CustomTabs prefetching - any Android app can request to prefetch several URLs to speed up displaying them later in a Chrome Custom Tab </li>\n<li>Privacy-preserving search result link prefetching - can be initiated by Chrome on Google Search result pages to prefetch links to other websites.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Four mechanisms preserve user privacy for search result link prefetches: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prefetching is restricted to domains for which Chrome doesn\u2019t have a corresponding cookie.\n</li>\n<li>Passive fingerprinting surfaces such as User-Agent are bucketed or set to fixed values.\n</li>\n<li>Prefetches are limited to HTTPS links and tunneled through a CONNECT proxy operated by Google.\nConsequently, the TLS connection is established between Chrome and the origin so the proxy server cannot inspect the traffic, and requests to the origin come from a Google IP address instead of the user\u2019s IP address.\nGoogle only learns about the destination domain and sub-resource domains that will be prefetched, which Google already knows because it generated the Search results page and crawled the page, respectively.\n</li>\n<li>Prefetched resources and cookies set by the prefetched domain are only persisted when you click the search result and visit the prefetched domain.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Controlling the feature</strong>.\nAll prefetching types except webpage prefetching are controlled by Chrome\u2019s prediction service setting.\nWebpage prefetching is allowed regardless of whether Chrome\u2019s network prediction service feature is enabled.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Handling of cookies</strong>.\nExcept for the privacy-preserving search result link prefetching case, the prefetched site is allowed to set and read its own cookies even if you don\u2019t end up visiting the prefetched page, and prefetching is disabled if you have chosen to block third-party cookies.\nIn the privacy-preserving search result link prefetching case, prefetching is disabled if you have a cookie for the site, and the site can only set a cookie once you click on the link that was prefetched.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Javascript execution</strong>.\nFor AMP prefetching the page is fully rendered and Javascript is also executed.\nFor the remaining types of prefetching Javascript is not executed.\n</p> Google search locale <p>If Google is set as your default search engine, Chrome will try to determine the most appropriate locale for Google search queries conducted from the omnibox in order to give you relevant search results based on your location.\nFor example, if you were in Germany, your omnibox searches may go through google.de instead of google.com.\n</p>\n<p>In order to do this, Chrome will send a request to google.com each time you start the browser.\nIf you already have any cookies from the google.com domain, this request will also include these cookies, and is logged as any normal HTTPS request to google.com would be (see the description of \u201cserver logs\u201d in the privacy key terms for details).\nIf you do not have any cookies from google.com, this request will not create any.\n</p> New Tab page <p>The Chrome New Tab page may display suggestions for websites that you might want to visit.\n</p>\n<p>In order to help you get started, Chrome may suggest content that is popular in your country or region.\nChrome uses your IP address to identify your country or region.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome tries to make personalized suggestions that are useful to you.\nFor this, Chrome uses the sites you have visited from your local browsing history.\nOn Android, the most popular languages of the sites you visited may also be sent to Google to provide suggestions in languages you prefer to read, and the device display DPI may be sent to format content for your device.\nTo save data, Chrome may additionally send a hash of the content that Google provided to you the last time, so that you only download content when there is something new.\n</p>\n<p>If you are signed into Chrome, suggestions are <i>also</i> based on data stored in your Google account activity.\nYou can control the collection of data in your Google account at Activity controls and manage your account activity at My Activity.\nFor example, if you sync your browsing history and have enabled its use in your Web &amp.\nApp activity, Google may suggest sites that relate to sites you have visited in the past.\nChrome measures the quality of suggestions by sending Google information about the sets of suggestions that were displayed, and those that were selected.\n</p>\n<p>On the desktop version of Chrome, you may also manually add shortcuts to websites that you regularly visit, or edit Chrome\u2019s existing website suggestions.\nAfter you add, edit, or delete a shortcut to a website, the Chrome New Tab page will not suggest any new websites to you.\n</p>\n<p>Suggestions generated from your browsing history will be removed once you clear your browsing history.\nHowever, if you customized your suggestions, they will not be removed.\n</p>\n<p>For Chrome on Android, in certain countries, Chrome may download the content of the New Tab page suggestions from Google, for use while offline.\nChrome sends to Google a cookieless request with the URL for each suggestion, along with Chrome\u2019s user agent string, in order to render the content.\nYou can remove downloaded content by clearing Chrome\u2019s cache data, or by opening the Downloads menu and selecting individual pages to delete.\nYou can disable this feature by disabling \u201cDownload articles for you on Wi-Fi\u201d in Chrome\u2019s Downloads settings.\n</p>\n<p>On mobile versions of Chrome, if you\u2019re signed in to Chrome and have the Web &amp.\nApp activity setting enabled for your account, your preferences for the suggested articles can be modified or removed using the \u201cManage Interests\u201d option from the three dots menu.\nYour preferences will be sent to Google so that better suggestions are provided to you in the future.\nFor example, if you indicate that you\u2019re not interested in a particular topic or publisher, suggestions about that topic or publisher will not be shown in the future.\nLikewise, you can indicate that you\u2019re not interested in a specific article via the \u201cHide story\u201d option in the article\u2019s three dots menu.\nSuggestions are also personalized based on your interactions with the suggested articles (for example, tapping on or ignoring an article).\nYou can manage this interaction data, which is stored in the Discover section of your Google account, at My Activity.\nGoogle may use anonymized and aggregated interest and interaction data from you to improve the quality of suggested articles for other users.\nFor instance, if you view or open a suggestion it might be suggested more often, while if you report its contents as inappropriate it might stop being suggested.\n</p>\n<p>For desktop and Android versions of Chrome, when you open a new tab, Chrome loads a New Tab page customized by your default search engine (e.g., google.com) if it\u2019s available.\nThis page is preloaded in the background and refreshed periodically so that it opens quickly.\nYour IP address and cookies, as well as your current browser theme, are sent to your search engine with each refresh request so that the New Tab page can be correctly displayed.\nSee the Embedded Search API for more details.\nYour search engine may also record your interactions with the New Tab page.\n</p>\n<p>The New Tab page content may be designed by your default search provider.\nSuggested websites are embedded by Chrome into the New Tab page in a way that does not expose them to your default search provider.\n</p>\n<p>If your default search provider is Google, the New Tab page also contains a web address and search bar that behaves like the omnibox.\n</p>\n<p>This information about the New Tab page may not apply if you've installed an extension that overrides the New Tab page.\n</p> Touch to Search <p>If you've enabled \"Touch to Search\" on Chrome Mobile you can search for terms by selecting them.\n</p>\n<p>When you select a word, the word, the surrounding text, the languages you speak (from Chrome's Languages settings), and the home country of your device's SIM card are sent to Google to identify recommended search terms (for example, selecting \"whale\" on a site about the blue whale would lead to the selection expanding to show \"blue whale\").\nThe selected word is logged in accordance with standard Google logging policies, and the surrounding text and home country are logged only when the page is already in Google's search index.\nIf you have turned on \u201cMake searches and browsing better\u201d, the URL of the page is also sent and logged, and is used to improve your query suggestions.\n</p>\n<p>When Google returns a search suggestion, a card appears that may present an action or additional information related to the search.\nOpening this card is considered a regular search and navigation on Google, so standard logging policies apply.\n</p>\n<p>Adjusting a selection causes a search for the exact selection.\nFor example, if the user selects \"climate\" and the selection is automatically expanded to \"climate change\", the user can adjust the selection back to just \"climate\" and opening the panel would show full search results for \"climate\" rather than \"climate change\".\nSaying \u201cOk Google\u201d after selecting a word provides the word and its surrounding text as context for the Google Assistant.\n</p>\n<p>Touch to Search is enabled in a limited mode by default: potentially privacy-sensitive data, such as the URL and surrounding text, is not sent for HTTPS pages.\nTouch to Search can be fully enabled and disabled in the card or in the Chrome privacy settings.\n</p> Search with Google Lens <p>On Android Chrome, if Google is selected as the default search engine and a recent version of the Google app is installed on your device, touching &amp.\nholding on an image will present you with an option to initiate a search with Google Lens.\n</p>\n<p>A tap on that menu item will redirect you to the Lens experience in the Google App and the image bytes of the selected image will be sent to the Google Lens app.\nFor non-incognito users, the name of the currently signed-in account (if applicable), image tag attributes, and Chrome experiments may also be sent to the Google App.\nThis information is used to improve the user experience within the Lens app.\n</p>\n<p>Triggering a Lens search is considered a regular search and navigation on Google, so standard logging policies apply.\n</p> Safe Browsing protection <p>Google Chrome includes an optional feature called \"Safe Browsing\" to help protect you against phishing, social engineering, malware, unwanted software, malicious ads, intrusive ads, and abusive websites or extensions.\nYou can find more information at safebrowsing.google.com about how Safe Browsing protects you in Chrome and other Google products.\nSafe Browsing is designed specifically to protect your privacy and is also used by other popular browsers.\n</p>\n<p>You can find settings for Safe Browsing in the \u201cPrivacy and security &gt.\nSecurity\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings.\nWhen Safe Browsing is enabled in the \u201cStandard protection\u201d mode (pictured below), Chrome contacts Google's servers periodically to download the most recent Safe Browsing list of unsafe sites including sites associated with phishing, social engineering, malware, unwanted software, malicious ads, intrusive ads, and abusive websites or Chrome extensions.\nThe most recent copy of this list is stored locally on your system.\nChrome checks the URL of each site you visit or file you download against this local list.\nIf you navigate to a URL that appears on the list, Chrome sends a partial URL fingerprint (the first 32 bits of a SHA-256 hash of the URL) to Google for verification that the URL is indeed dangerous.\nChrome also sends a partial URL fingerprint when a site requests a potentially dangerous permission, so that Google can protect you if the site is malicious.\nGoogle cannot determine the actual URL from this information.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the URL check described above, Chrome also conducts client-side checks.\nIf a website looks suspicious, Chrome sends a subset of likely phishing and social engineering terms found on the page to Google, in order to determine whether the website should be considered malicious.\nThese client-side checks also include comparisons of the visual appearance of the page to a list of images of login pages.\nIf a website appears similar to a page on this list, Chrome will send the URL and the matched entry on the list to Google to determine whether the page is a likely phishing attempt.\nChrome can also help protect you from phishing if you type one of your previously saved passwords into an uncommon site.\nIn this case Chrome sends the URL and referrers of the page to Google to see if the page might be trying to steal your password.\n</p>\n<p>If you encounter a website that is on Chrome\u2019s Safe Browsing list, you may see a warning like the one shown below.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can visit our malware warning test page or social engineering warning test page to see the above example in action.\nFor more information about the warning pages, see Manage warnings about unsafe sites.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you've opted into \u201cMake Searches and Browsing Better (sends URLs of the pages you visit to Google)\u201d, Chrome sends a request to Safe Browsing each time you visit a page that isn\u2019t in Chrome\u2019s local list of safe sites in order to gather the latest reputation of that website (we call this mechanism \u201creal-time checks\u201d).\nIf you sync your browsing history without a sync passphrase, this request also contains a temporary authentication token tied to your Google account to provide better protections to some users whose account may be under attack.\nIf the website is deemed unsafe by Safe Browsing, you may see a warning like the one shown above.\nThis mechanism is designed to catch unsafe sites that switch domains very quickly or hide from Google's crawlers.\nPages loaded in Incognito are not checked using this mechanism.\n</p>\n<p>You can also opt in to reporting additional data relevant to security to help improve Safe Browsing and security on the Internet.\nYou can opt in by turning on the \u201cHelp improve security on the web for everyone\u201d setting in the \u201cPrivacy and security &gt.\nSecurity\u201d section of Chrome's settings.\nYou can also opt in from the warning page shown above.\nIf you opt in, Chrome will send an incident report to Google every time you receive a warning, visit a suspicious page, and on a very small fraction of sites where Chrome thinks there could be threats, to help Safe Browsing learn about the new threats you may be encountering.\nAdditionally, some downloaded files that are suspicious and show a warning may be sent to Google for investigation each time they are encountered.\nAll reports are sent to Google over an encrypted channel and can include URLs, headers, and snippets of content from the page and they never include data from browsing you do in Incognito mode.\nIf Chrome discovers unwanted or malicious software on your machine, the reports may also include details about malicious files and registry entries.\nThis data is used only to improve Safe Browsing and to improve security on the Internet.\nFor example, Chrome reports some SSL certificate chains to Google to help improve the accuracy of Chrome\u2019s SSL warnings.\nAs part of Certificate Transparency, Chrome also reports to Google a sampling of information about SSL certificates and any observed signed certificate timestamps (SCTs).\nThese reports help Google verify that the third-party logs in the Certificate Transparency system are behaving honestly, which helps ensure that HTTPS connections can be trusted.\nChrome does not send reports for connections authenticated with certificates that chain to locally installed roots.\n</p>\n<p>Please be aware that if you disable the Safe Browsing feature, Chrome will no longer be able to protect you from websites that try to steal your information or install harmful software.\nWe don't recommend turning it off.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a webmaster, developer, or network admin, you can find more relevant information about Safe Browsing on this page.\n</p>\n<p>Safe Browsing also protects you from abusive extensions and malicious software.\nWhen Chrome starts, and on each update of the Safe Browsing list, Chrome scans extensions installed in your browser against the Safe Browsing list.\nIf an extension on the list is found, Chrome will disable the extension, offer you relevant information and may provide an option for you to remove the extension or re-enable it.\nChrome also sends the particular extension ID to Safe Browsing.Extensions can also be disabled by Chrome if they're determined to be malicious during an update.\nIf you attempt to download a file on Chrome\u2019s Safe Browsing list, you'll see a warning like this one: </p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>To warn you about potentially dangerous files, like the picture shown above, Chrome checks the URL of potentially dangerous file types you download against a list of URLs that have been verified.\nPotentially dangerous file types include both executables and commonly-abused document types.\nThis list is stored locally on your computer and updated regularly.\nChrome does not send information to Google for files you download from URLs in this list, or if the file is signed by a verified publisher.\nFor all other unverified potentially dangerous file downloads, Chrome sends Google the information needed to help determine whether the download is harmful, including some or all of the following: information about the full URL of the site or file download, all related referrers and redirects, code signing certificates, file hashes, and file header information.\nChrome may then show a warning like the one pictured above.\n</p>\n<p>If you are enrolled in Google's Advanced Protection Program, Chrome will show you additional warnings when you download files but where Safe Browsing is unable to ascertain they are safe.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome helps protect you against password phishing by checking with Google when you enter your password on an uncommon page.\nChrome keeps a local list of popular websites that Safe Browsing found to be safe.\nIf Chrome detects that you have entered your Google account password or one of your passwords stored in Chrome\u2019s password manager on a website that\u2019s not on the list, it sends a request to Safe Browsing to gather the reputation of that website.\nThe verdict received from Safe Browsing is usually cached on your device for 1 week.\nFor users who have enabled the \"Help improve security on the web for everyone\" setting, Chrome will ignore the list of popular websites for a small fraction of visits, to test the accuracy of that list.\n</p>\n<p>If the reused password is your Google account password and the verdict for the website is that it is phishing, Chrome will suggest that you change your Google account password to avoid losing access to your account.\n</p>\n<p>If you sync your browsing history without a sync passphrase, or if you accept the \u201cProtect account\u201d option from the dialog shown below, Chrome sends a request to Google to protect your account.\nThis request contains the URL where the phishing attempt happened, and the verdict received from Safe Browsing.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you've opted into \u201cHelp improve security on the web for everyone\u201d, Chrome also sends a request to Safe Browsing each time you start to enter a password on a page that isn\u2019t in Chrome\u2019s local list.\nIn addition, the request Chrome sends to Safe Browsing to determine the reputation of the website on which you reuse your password includes the list of websites for which you saved this password in Chrome\u2019s password manager (but not the password itself).\n</p>\n<p>If Chrome detects that your settings have been tampered with, Chrome reports the URL of the last downloaded potentially dangerous file, and information about the nature of the possible tampering, to the Safe Browsing service.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome asks your permission before using certain web features (APIs) that might have associated risks.\nSome sites trigger these permission requests or use the corresponding APIs in ways that are abusive or that users find undesirable or annoying.\nOn these sites Chrome may send the partial URL fingerprint to Google to verify if a less intrusive UI should be used to surface the request.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve opted into \u201cEnhanced protection\u201d (pictured above), in addition to all the protections described above for \u201cStandard protection\u201d mode, Chrome will use the real-time checks mechanism described above for checking the Safe Browsing reputation of top-level URLs and iframe URLs.\nIf you're signed in to Chrome, the requests for performing real-time checks and the requests for checking potentially dangerous file downloads contain a temporary authentication token tied to your Google account that is used to protect you across Google apps.\nEnhanced protection also enables reporting additional data relevant to security to help improve Safe Browsing and overall web security, and it enables Chrome\u2019s password breach detection.\nWhen browsing in incognito or guest mode, these extra checks do not occur, and Enhanced protection mode operates the same way as Standard protection.\n</p>\n<p>For all Safe Browsing requests and reports, Google logs the transferred data in its raw form and retains this data for up to 30 days.\nGoogle collects standard log information for Safe Browsing requests, including an IP address and one or more cookies.\nAfter at most 30 days, Safe Browsing deletes the raw logs, storing only calculated data in an anonymized form that does not include your IP addresses or cookies.\nAdditionally, Safe Browsing requests won\u2019t be associated with your Google Account, except if the request includes the temporary authentication token described above.\nThey are, however, tied to the other Safe Browsing requests made from the same device.\n</p>\n<p>For Chrome on iOS 13 and later, Apple allows for connecting to multiple Safe Browsing services.\nThis means that Chrome may connect to a third-party Safe Browsing service instead of the Google one.\nApple determines which Safe Browsing service to connect to based on factors like your device locale.\n</p> Safety Check <p>Google Chrome includes a Safety check feature in settings.\nRunning the Safety check verifies whether the browser is up to date, whether Safe Browsing is enabled, whether your passwords have been exposed as a part of a data breach, on Desktop whether you have potentially harmful extensions installed, and on Windows whether unwanted software has been found on your device.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Unwanted software protection <p>The Windows version of Chrome is able to detect and remove certain types of software that violate Google's Unwanted Software Policy.\nIf left in your system, this software may perform unwanted actions, such as changing your Chrome settings without your approval.\nChrome periodically scans your device to detect potentially unwanted software.\nIn addition, if you have opted in to automatically report details of possible security incidents to Google, Chrome will report information about unwanted software, including relevant file metadata and system settings linked to the unwanted software found on your computer.\n</p>\n<p>If you perform an unwanted software check on your computer from the Settings page, Chrome reports information about unwanted software and your system.\nSystem information includes metadata about programs installed or running on your system that could be associated with harmful software, such as: services and processes, scheduled tasks, system registry values commonly used by malicious software, command-line arguments of Chrome shortcuts, Windows proxy settings, and software modules loaded into Chrome or the network stack.\nYou can opt out of sharing this data by deselecting the checkbox next to \"Report details to Google\" before starting the scan.\n</p>\n<p>If unwanted software is detected, Chrome will offer you an option to clean it up by using the Chrome Cleanup Tool.\nThis will quarantine detected malicious files, delete harmful extensions and registry keys, and reset your settings.\nThe Chrome Cleanup Tool also reports information about unwanted software and your system to Google, and again you can opt out of sharing this data by deselecting the checkbox next to \"Report details to Google\" before starting the cleanup.\n</p>\n<p>This data is used for the purpose of improving Google\u2019s ability to detect unwanted software and offer better protection to Chrome users.\nIt is used in accordance with Google\u2019s Privacy Policy and is stored for up to 14 days, after which only aggregated statistics are retained.\n</p> Offline Indicator <p>On Android versions Lollipop and older, when Chrome detects a network change, it sends a cookieless request to http://connectivitycheck.gstatic.com/generate_204 or http://clients4.google.com/generate_204 to determine whether you\u2019re offline and display an offline indicator.\n</p> Software updates <p>Desktop versions of Chrome and the Google Chrome Apps Launcher use Google Update to keep you up to date with the latest and most secure versions of software.\nIn order to provide greater transparency and to make the technology available to other applications, the Google Update technology is open source.\n</p>\n<p>Google Update requests include information necessary for the update process, such as the version of Chrome, its release channel, basic hardware information, and update errors that have been encountered.\nThe update requests also send Google information that helps us understand how many people are using Google Chrome and the Chrome Apps Launcher \u23bc specifically, whether the software was used in the last day, the number of days since the last time it was used, the total number of days it has been installed, and the number of active profiles.\nGoogle Update also periodically sends a non-unique four-letter tag that contains information about how you obtained Google Chrome.\nThis tag is not personally identifiable, does not encode any information about when you obtained Google Chrome, and is the same as everyone who obtained Google Chrome the same way.\n</p>\n<p>Because Chrome OS updates the entire OS stack, Google Update on Chrome OS also sends the current Chrome OS version and hardware model information to Google in order to ensure that the correct software updates and hardware manufacturer customizations such as apps, wallpaper, and help articles are delivered.\nThis information is not personally identifiable, and is common to all users of Chrome OS on the same revision of device.\n</p>\n<p>Unlike the desktop versions of Chrome, the delivery and management of updates for mobile versions of Chrome are managed through the app stores for Android and iOS.\nMobile versions of Chrome utilize the servers described above for counting active installations and for user-initiated checks for updates.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome extensions and applications that you\u2019ve installed are kept up to date with a similar system used for updating desktop versions of Chrome.\nThese update requests include similar information (such as the application ID, when the application was last used, and how long it\u2019s been installed).\nWe use these requests to determine the aggregate popularity and usage of applications and extensions.\nIf you are using an extension or application restricted to a certain audience, authentication tokens are sent with the update requests for these add-ons.\nFor security reasons, Chrome also occasionally sends a cookieless request to the Chrome Web Store, in order to verify that installed extensions and applications that claim to be from the store are genuine.\n</p>\n<p>In order to keep updates as small as possible, Google Chrome is internally split into a variety of components, each of which can be updated independently.\nEach component is uniquely identified via an ID that is shared among all Google Chrome installations (e.g., \u201cfmeadaodfnidclnjhlkdgjkolmhmfofk\u201d).\nAn update request for a component contains this ID, the hash of the previous download (called a \"fingerprint\"), and the component\u2019s version.\nBecause every installation has the same ID, and downloads of the same component have the same fingerprint, none of this information is personally identifiable.\n</p>\n<p>If you install web apps on an Android device, a Google server is responsible for creating a native Android package that can be verified for authenticity by Chrome.\nWhen Chrome is updated or notices that the web app's manifest has changed, Chrome asks the server for a new version of the Android package in a cookieless request.\nIf the information needed to create the native Android package cannot be acquired by the server (e.g., because the information is behind a corporate firewall), Chrome sends it to Google and an Android package is created that is unique to you.\nIt contains a unique and random identifier that is not tied to your identity.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome may also download and run a binary executable (e.g., as part of the software update or to improve Safe Browsing protection).\nThese executables are cryptographically signed and verified before execution.\nChrome may download further static resources like dictionaries on demand to reduce the size of the installer.\n</p>\n<p>On Windows and OS X versions of Chrome, the recovery component tries to repair Google Update when it\u2019s broken.\nAfter the relevant binary is executed, Google Update uploads statistics on the actions that were performed.\nThese statistics contain no personally identifiable information.\n</p> Network time <p>On desktop platforms, Chrome uses network time to verify SSL certificates, which are valid only for a specified time.\nAt random intervals or when Chrome encounters an expired SSL certificate, Chrome may send requests to Google to obtain the time from a trusted source.\nThese requests are more frequent if Chrome believes the system clock is inaccurate.\nThese requests contain no cookies and are not logged on the server.\n</p> Counting installations <p>In order to measure the success rate of Google Chrome downloads and installations of the Windows version of Google Chrome, a randomly-generated token is included with Google Chrome's installer.\nThis token is sent to Google during the installation process to confirm the success of that particular installation.\nA new token is generated for every install.\nIt is not associated with any personal information, and is deleted once Google Chrome runs and checks for updates the first time.\n</p>\n<p>For Chrome to know how many active installations it has, the mobile version of Chrome sends a ping to Google with a salted hash of a device identifier on an ongoing basis.\nThe desktop version of Chrome does not send any stable identifier to count active installations.\nInstead an anonymous message to Google with a timestamp of the last ping is used to infer number of active installations.\n</p> Measuring effectiveness of a promotion <p>Chrome utilizes two measurements to understand how effective a promotional campaign has been: how many Chrome installations are acquired through a promotional campaign, and how much Chrome usage and traffic to Google is driven by a campaign.\n</p>\n<p>To measure installations or reactivations of Chrome through a campaign, Chrome will send a token or an identifier unique to your device to Google at the first launch of Chrome, as well as the first search using Google.\nOn desktop versions of Chrome, a token unique to your device is generated.\nThe same token will be sent if Chrome is later reinstalled at first launch and at first use of the Omnibox after reinstallation or reactivation.\nRather than storing the token on the computer, it is generated when necessary by using built-in system information that is scrambled in an irreversible manner.\nOn iOS, Chrome uses the IDFA for counting installations acquired by a campaign, and it can be reset in iOS settings.\n</p>\n<p>To measure searches and Chrome usage driven by a particular campaign, Chrome inserts a promotional tag, not unique to you or your device, in the searches you perform on Google.\nThis non-unique tag contains information about how Chrome was obtained, the week when Chrome was installed, and the week when the first search was performed.\nFor desktop versions of Chrome, Chrome generates a promotional tag, if the promotional installation token described in the previous paragraph indicates that Chrome has been installed or reactivated by a campaign on a device which has not been associated with any campaign yet.\nFor Chrome on Mobile, a promotional tag is always sent regardless of the source of installations.\n</p>\n<p>The promotional tag is generated using a software library called \"RLZ\" and looks similar to \u201c1T4ADBR_enUS236US239\u201d.\nThe RLZ library was fully open-sourced in June 2010.\nFor more information, please see the In the Open, for RLZ post on the Chromium blog and the article \u201cHow To Read An RLZ String\u201d.\nOn Android, this promotional tag can also be a readable string like \"android-hms-tmobile-us\" instead of an RLZ string, and is not unique to either you or your device.\n</p>\n<p>This non-unique promotional tag is included when performing searches via Google (the tag appears as a parameter beginning with \"rlz=\" when triggered from the Omnibox, or as an \u201cx-rlz-string\u201d HTTP header).\nWe use this information to measure the searches and Chrome usage driven by a particular promotion.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If usage statistics and crash reports are enabled, the RLZ string is sent along with the report.\nThis allows us to improve Chrome based on variations that are limited to specific geographic regions.\n</p>\n<p>For the desktop version of Chrome, you can opt-out of sending this data to Google by uninstalling Chrome, and installing a version downloaded directly from www.google.com/chrome.\nTo opt-out of sending the RLZ string in Chrome OS, press Ctrl + Alt + T to open the crosh shell, type rlz disable followed by the enter key, and then reboot your device.\n</p> Usage statistics and crash reports <p>Chrome has a feature to automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google in order to help improve Chrome\u2019s feature set and stability.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Usage statistics contain information such as system information, preferences, user interface feature usage, responsiveness, performance, and memory usage.\nCrash reports contain system information gathered at the time of the crash, and may contain web page URLs, actions taken by the user before the crash, and/or personal information depending on what was happening at the time of the crash.\nThis feature is enabled by default for Chrome installations of version 54 or later.\nYou can control the feature in the \"Sync and Google services\" section of Chrome's settings.\n</p>\n<p>When this feature is enabled, Google Chrome stores a randomly generated unique token on your device, which is sent to Google along with your usage statistics and crash reports.\nThe token does not contain any personal information and is used to de-duplicate reports and maintain accuracy in statistics.\nThis token is deleted when the feature is disabled and a new token is regenerated when the feature is enabled again.\n</p>\n<p>By default, the usage statistics do not include any personal information.\nHowever, if you're signed in to Chrome and have enabled Chrome sync, Chrome may combine your declared age and gender from your Google account with our statistics to help us build products better suited for your demographics.\nThis demographic data is not included in crash reports.\n</p>\n<p>Along with usage statistics and crash reports, Chrome also reports anonymous, randomized data that is constructed in a manner which is not linked to the unique token, and which ensures that no information can be inferred about any particular user's activity.\nThis data collection mechanism is summarized on the Google research blog, and full technical details have been published in a technical report and presented at the 2014 ACM Computer and Communications Security conference.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome will also anonymously report to Google if requests to websites operated by Google fail or succeed in order to detect and fix problems quickly.\n</p>\n<p>If you have also turned on \u201cMake searches and browsing better (Sends URLs of pages you visit to Google)\u201d in the \u201cSync and Google services\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings, Chrome usage statistics include information about the web pages you visit and your usage of them.\nThe information will also include the URLs and statistics related to downloaded files.\nIf you sync extensions, these statistics will also include information about the extensions that have been installed from Chrome Web Store.\nThe URLs and statistics are sent along with a unique device identifier that can be reset by turning off \u201cMake searches and browsing better\u201d in the \u201cSync and Google services\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings or by turning off usage statistics and crash reports.\nThe usage statistics are not tied to your Google account.\nGoogle only stores usage statistics associated with published extensions, and URLs that are known by Google\u2019s web crawlers.\nWe use this information to improve our products and services, for example, by identifying web pages which load slowly.\nthis gives us insight into how to best improve overall Chrome performance.\nWe also make some statistics available externally, through efforts like the Chrome User Experience Report.\nExternally published reports are conducted in highly aggregated manner to not reveal individual user's identity.\n</p>\n<p>On iOS, if you are syncing your browsing history without a sync passphrase, Chrome reports usage for certain URLs that other Google apps could open.\nFor example, when you tap on an email address, Chrome presents a dialog that allows you to choose between opening with Google Gmail or other mail apps installed on your device.\nThe usage information also includes which apps were presented to you, which one was selected, and if a Google app was installed.\nChrome does not log the actual URL tapped.\nIf you are signed in, this usage is tied to your Google account.\nIf you are signed out, the information is sent to Google with a unique device identifier that can be regenerated by resetting the Google Usage ID found in Chrome settings.\nThe raw reports are deleted within 60 days, after which only the aggregated statistics remain.\n</p> Google Surveys in Chrome <p>In Chrome on Android and Desktop, when you have \"send usage statistics\" enabled, you may be randomly selected to participate in surveys to evaluate consumer satisfaction with Chrome features.\nIf you are selected, Chrome requests a survey from Google for you.\nIf a survey is available, Chrome then asks you to answer the survey and submit responses to Google.\n</p>\n<p>The survey also records basic metrics about your actions, such as time spent looking at the survey and elements that the user clicked.\nThese metrics are sent to Google even if you do not fully complete the survey.\n</p>\n<p>Google uses strategies to ensure that surveys are spread evenly across users and not repeatedly served to a single user.\nOn Android, Chrome stores a randomly generated unique token on the device.\nOn Desktop, Chrome uses a cookie to connect with the server.\nThis token or cookie is used solely for the survey requests and does not contain any personal information.\nIf you disable sending usage statistics, the token or cookie will be cleared.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Suggestions for spelling errors <p>Desktop versions of Chrome can provide smarter spell-checking by sending text you type into the browser to Google's servers, allowing you to apply the same spell-checking technology that\u2019s used by Google products like Docs.\nIf this feature is enabled, Chrome sends the entire contents of text fields as you type in them to Google, along with the browser\u2019s default language.\nGoogle returns a list of suggested spellings that are displayed in the context menu.\nCookies are not sent along with these requests.\nRequests are logged temporarily and anonymously for debugging and quality improvement purposes.\n</p>\n<p>This feature is disabled by default.\nto turn it on, click \u201cAsk Google for suggestions\u201d in the context menu that appears when you right-click on a misspelled word.\nYou can also turn this feature on or off with the \u201cEnhanced spell check\u201d checkbox in the \u201cSync and Google services\u201d section of Chrome settings.\nWhen the feature is turned off, spelling suggestions are generated locally without sending data to Google's servers.\n</p>\n<p>Mobile versions of Chrome rely on the operating system to provide spell-checking.\n</p> Translate <p>Google Chrome\u2019s built-in translation feature helps you read more of the Web, regardless of the language of the web page.\nThe feature is enabled by default.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Translation can be disabled at any time in Chrome\u2019s settings.\n</p>\n<p>Language <em>detection</em> is done entirely using a client-side library, and does not involve any Google servers.\nFor <em>translation</em>, the contents of a web page are only sent to Google if you decide to have it translated.\nYou can do that on an individual basis on each page that shows a translation option or for all pages in a specific language by choosing \u201cAlways translate\u201d in the Translate UI.\nAdditionally, you can do so by clicking on a translated search result on the Google Search Results Page.\n</p>\n<p>If you do choose to translate a web page, the text of that page is sent to Google Translate for translation.\nYour cookies are not sent along with that request and the request is sent over SSL.\nThis communication with Google's translation service is covered by the Google privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve chosen to sync your Chrome history, statistics about the languages of pages you visit and about your interactions with the translation feature will be sent to Google to improve Chrome\u2019s understanding of the languages you speak and when Chrome should offer to translate text for you.\n</p> Image Descriptions for screen reader users <p>Chrome can provide automatic descriptions for users who are visually impaired by sending the contents of images on pages you visit to Google's servers.\nThis feature is only enabled when Chrome detects that the user has a screen reader running and if the user explicitly enables it in the page context menu.\nCookies are not sent along with these requests.\nChrome fetches the list of supported languages from Google's servers and then requests descriptions in the most appropriate language given the current web page and the user's language preferences.\nRequests are not logged.\n</p> Sign In to Chrome and sync <p>You have the option to use the Chrome browser while signed in to your Google Account, with or without sync enabled.\n</p>\n<p>On desktop versions of Chrome, signing into or out of any Google web service, like google.com, signs you into or out of Chrome.\nOn Chrome on Android, when you sign into any Google web service, Chrome may offer you to sign in with the accounts that are already signed in on the device.\nSigning into Chrome via this dialog doesn\u2019t turn on sync.\nIf you want to just sign in to the Google web service and not to Chrome, you can dismiss the dialog and enter your credentials manually in the web form in the background.\nIf you are signed in to Chrome, Chrome may offer to save your passwords, payment cards and related billing information to your Google Account.\nChrome may also offer you the option of filling passwords or payment cards from your Google Account into web forms.\nIf you would like to sign into Google web services, like google.com, without Chrome asking whether you want to save your info to your Google Account, you can turn off Chrome sign-in.\n</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed-in and have enabled sync with your Google Account, your personal browsing data information is saved in your Google Account so you may access it when you sign in and sync to Chrome on other computers and devices.\nSynced data can include bookmarks, saved passwords, open tabs, browsing history, extensions, addresses, phone numbers, payment methods, and more.\nIn advanced sync settings, you can choose which types of data to synchronize with this device.\nBy default, all syncable data types are enabled.\nYou can turn sync on or off in the \u201cYou and Google\u201d section of Chrome settings.\n</p>\n<p>If you have turned on sync and signed out of the account you are syncing to, sync will pause sending all syncable data to Google until you sign back in with the same account.\nSome sync data types (such as bookmarks and passwords) that are saved locally while sync is paused will automatically be synced to your account after you sign back in with the same account.\n</p>\n<p>On mobile versions of Chrome, you can turn sync on or off in Chrome settings.\nThis can be done for any account that has already been added to the mobile device without authenticating again.\n</p>\n<p>On both desktop and mobile, signing into Chrome keeps you signed into Google web services until you sign out of Chrome.\nOn mobile, signing into Chrome will keep you signed in with all Google Accounts that have been added to the device.\nOn desktop, it will keep you signed in with all Google Accounts that you added from a Google web service, unless you have set \u201cClear cookies and site data when you quit Chrome\u201d in your cookie settings.\n</p>\n<p>On Android and desktop, Chrome signals to Google web services that you are signed into Chrome by attaching an X-Chrome-Connected header to any HTTPS requests to Google-owned domains.\nOn iOS, the CHROME_CONNECTED cookie is used instead.\nOn Android, Chrome sends the X-Chrome-Connected header to accounts.google.com to indicate it is eligible for account consistency (meaning that you can sign in to Chrome and Google web services with the Google Accounts already present on your device).\nThis allows those Google web services to update their UI accordingly.\nOn desktop, Chrome sends the X-Chrome-ID-Consistency-Request header with all HTTPS requests to account.google.com if the \u201cAllow Chrome sign-in\u201d setting is enabled.\nIf you are using a managed device, your system admin may disable the sign in feature or require that data be deleted when you disconnect your account.\n</p>\n<p>Users can share phone numbers and text between their devices (mobile or desktop) when they are signed-in to Chrome.\nThe transferred data is encrypted during transit and Google cannot read or store the content.\nTo let users select the device to share with, Chrome collects the following information about devices on which a user is signed-in and stores that in the user's Google account: device manufacturer, model number, Chrome version, OS, and device type.\n</p>\n<p>Google uses your personal synchronized data to provide you a consistent browsing experience across your devices, and to customize features in Chrome.\nYou can manage your synchronized history by going to chrome://history in your Chrome browser.\nIf \u201cInclude history from Chrome and other apps in your Web &amp.\nApp Activity\u201d is checked on the Web &amp.\nApp Activity controls page, Google also uses your synchronized browsing data to provide personalized Google products and services to you.\nYou can change your preference any time, and manage individual activities associated with your Google account.\n</p>\n<p>The paragraph above describes the use of your personal browsing history.\nGoogle also uses aggregated and anonymized synchronized browsing data to improve other Google products and services.\nFor example, we use this information to improve Google Search by helping to detect mobile friendly pages, pages which have stopped serving content, and downloads of malware.\n</p>\n<p>For sync users, Google may collect additional information derived from Chrome history for the Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) experiment.\nFLoC is one of the open standards proposed as part of the Privacy Sandbox, an initiative to make the web more private and secure for users while also supporting publishers.\nChrome\u2019s implementation of FLoC assigns each user to an interest cohort - a cluster representing a large group of users who share similar browsing habits - and periodically updates this assignment by similarity-hashing recently visited URLs from navigation history.\nAs a first step in the FLoC experiments, Google is logging users' cohorts via sync if you are syncing history without a custom passphrase, and if \u201cInclude Chrome history and activity from sites, apps, and devices that use Google services\u201d in your Google Activity Controls as well as \u201cAlso use your activity &amp.\ninformation from Google services to personalize ads on websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads\u201d in your Google Ad Settings are enabled.\nGoogle will use logged interest cohorts to perform an internal privacy analysis before making them available to the web ecosystem for broader testing.\n</p>\n<p>If you would like to use Google's cloud to store and sync your Chrome data without allowing any personalized and aggregated use by Google as described in the previous paragraphs, you can choose to encrypt all of your synced data with a sync passphrase.\nIf you choose this option, it\u2019s important to note that Google won\u2019t have access to the sync passphrase you set.\nwe won\u2019t be able to help you recover data if you forget the passphrase.\nRegardless of how you choose to encrypt your data, all data is always sent over secure SSL connections to Google\u2019s servers.\n</p>\n<p>Google will store the metadata about the days on which sync was running to improve other Google products and services.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome may help you sign in with credentials you've saved in Android apps on websites that are associated with the respective apps.\nLikewise, credentials you've saved for websites can be used to help you sign into related Android apps.\nYou can view the credentials you've saved in Chrome and Android by visiting passwords.google.com in any browser.\nIf you've saved credentials for Android applications, Chrome periodically sends a cookieless request to Google to get an updated list of websites that are associated with those applications.\nTo stop websites and Android apps from automatically signing in using credentials you previously saved, you can turn off Auto Sign-In on passwords.google.com or in Chrome settings under \"Autofill &gt.\nPasswords\".\nFor more details see this article.\n</p>\n<p>To make the history page easier to use, Chrome displays favicons of visited URLs.\nFor Chrome browsing history from your other devices, these favicons are fetched from Google servers via cookieless requests that only contain the given URL and device display DPI.\nFavicons are not fetched for users with sync passphrase.\n</p>\n<p>On the iOS version of Chrome, if you sync your browsing history without a sync passphrase and your browser\u2019s usage statistics and crash reports setting is also enabled, your usage statistics and crash reports will include statistics about the pages you visit.\nYou can read more in the Usage statistics and crash reports section of this Whitepaper.\n</p>\n<p>All data synchronized through Google\u2019s servers is subject to Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nTo get an overview of the Chrome data stored for your Google Account, go to the Chrome section of Google Dashboard.\nThat page also allows you to stop synchronization completely and delete all sync data from Google\u2019s servers.\n</p> Autofill and Password Management <p>Google Chrome has a form autofill feature that helps you fill out forms on the web more quickly.\nAutofill is enabled by default, but it can be turned off at any time in Chrome\u2019s settings.\n</p>\n<p>If Autofill is enabled and you encounter a web page containing a form, Chrome sends some information about that form to Google.\nThis information includes the basic structure of the form, a hash of the web page's hostname as well as form identifiers (such as field names).\nrandomized representation of the form identifiers, and if you have turned on the \"Make searches and browsing better (Sends URLs of pages you visit to Google)\" setting, also a randomized representation of the web page's URL.\nIn response, Chrome receives a prediction of each field\u2019s data type (for example, \u201cfield X is a phone number, and field Y is a country\u201d).\nThis information helps Chrome match up your locally stored Autofill data with the fields of the form.\n</p>\n<p>If Autofill is enabled when you <em>submit</em> a form, Chrome sends Google some information about the form along with the types of data you submitted.\nThis information includes a hash of the web page\u2019s hostname, as well as form identifiers (such as field names), the basic structure of the form, and the observed data types for the fields (i.e., field X was a phone number, field Y was a country).\nThe values you entered into the form are not sent to Google.\nThis information helps Chrome improve the quality of its form-filling over time.\n</p>\n<p>You can manage your Autofill entries via Chrome\u2019s settings, and you can edit or delete saved information at any time.\nChrome will never store full credit card information (card number, cardholder name, and expiration date) without explicit confirmation.\nIn order to prevent offering to save cards you have shown disinterest in saving, Chrome stores the last four digits of detected credit cards locally on the device.\nIf you scan your credit card using a phone camera, the recognition is performed locally.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome may help you sign in to websites with credentials you've saved to Chrome's password manager or your Google Account by autofilling sign-in forms, by offering you an account picker, or by automatically signing you in.\nYou can manage and delete your saved credentials in the \u201cForms and passwords\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings.\nIf you enable password management, the same kind of data about forms as described above is sent to Google to interpret password forms correctly.\nTo enable Chrome to offer password generation that meets site-specific requirements, Chrome uploads a randomized vote on a specific password characteristic to the server once a user-created password is stored.\nIf stored credentials are used for the first time in a username field which was already filled differently by the website itself, Chrome also transmits a short one-byte hash of the prefilled value.\nThis allows Google to classify if the website uses a static placeholder in the username field which can be safely overwritten without deleting valuable user-specific data.\nGoogle cannot reconstruct the value from this hash.\n</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed in to Chrome with your Google Account on desktop, Chrome may offer you to use credentials you\u2019ve saved to your account, to generate a strong password, or to save credentials to your Google Account.\nTo access credentials in your Google Account, Chrome may ask you to re-authenticate to your Google Account.\nCredentials from your Google Account will be available on the device while you\u2019re signed in, even when you are offline.\nIf sync isn\u2019t enabled, when you sign out of Chrome, all credentials stored in your Google Account are removed from Chrome on the device.\nWhile signed in to Chrome, you can choose to store a credential after you have signed into a site to your Google Account or locally to the device.\nLocally-saved credentials are not deleted when you sign out of Chrome.\nAfter you have used a locally-saved credential to sign into a site, Chrome may also offer you to move the locally stored credentials to your account.\n</p>\n<p>When you sign in to a site, Chrome may give you a warning if the username/password have been exposed as a result of a data breach on some website or app.\nThe feature is available on all platforms but only to the users signed in with a Google account.\nOn Android the feature is only available if sync is also enabled, due to the way the accounts are managed by the OS.\nBeing signed in to a Google account is a technical requirement that prevents abuse of the API.\nWhen you sign in to a website, Chrome will send a hashed copy of your username and password to Google encrypted with a secret key only known to Chrome.\nNo one, including Google, is able to derive your username or password from this encrypted copy.\nFrom the response, Chrome can tell if the submitted username and password appear in the database of leaked credentials.\nThe final resolution is done locally.\nGoogle doesn\u2019t know whether or not the credential is present in the database.\nThe feature can be disabled in settings under Sync and Google services.\nOn desktop and Android versions of Chrome, this feature is not available if Safe Browsing is turned off.\n</p>\n<p>Using the same secure method described above, you can check all the saved passwords against the public data breaches in the \u201cPasswords\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings.\nOnce you\u2019ve run a password check, Chrome will show a list of breached passwords.\nIf a password in this list is outdated, you can manually edit it to store the current version.\nIf you choose to edit, the new username/password pair will be checked automatically but only if the feature described above is not disabled.\n</p>\n<p>Also, if you choose, you can bring your Autofill data with you to all your Chrome-enabled devices by syncing it as part of your browser settings (see the \u201cSign In to Chrome\u201d section of this document).\nIf you choose to sync Autofill information, field values are sent as described in \u201cSign In to Chrome\u201d.\notherwise, field values are not sent.\n</p>\n<p>If you enable Chrome\u2019s credential provider extension in iOS Autofill passwords settings, Chrome will be able to autofill the passwords currently saved in Chrome into other apps on your device, such as Safari.\nThe extension does not store Chrome passwords.\nIf the device's keychain or the iCloud keychain are enabled as a credential provider, then the extension will prompt you to save the recently used password in the keychain.\n</p> Payments <p>When you\u2019re signed into Chrome with your Google Account, Chrome may offer to save payment cards and related billing addresses into payment data under the same Google Account, and include cards from your account among the autofill suggestions on payment web forms.\nIf you're not signed in, Chrome offers to save your credit cards locally.\nIf the card is not stored locally, you will be prompted for your CVV code or device authentication, such as Touch ID, Windows Hello, or Android screen lock, each time you use the card.\nIn some versions of Chrome, it is possible to store a card to Google Payments and locally in Chrome at the same time, in which case Chrome will not ask for a CVV or device authentication confirmation.\nIf you have cards stored in this way, their local copies will persist until you sign out of your Google account, at which point the local copy will be deleted from your device.\nIf you choose not to store the card locally, you will be prompted for your CVV code or device authentication each time you use the card.\nYou can opt out of using device authentication in the Payment methods section of Chrome settings.\nIf you use a card from Google Payments, Chrome will collect information about your computer and share it with Google Payments to prevent fraudulent use of your card.\nIf you use device authentication to confirm cards from Google Payments, an identifier scoped to a device and signed-in session will be used to ensure that the device and account autofilling the card should have access to it.\n</p>\n<p>To delete credit card information saved in Chrome, follow the \u201cAdd and edit credit cards\u201d steps in the Autofill article.\nWhen you delete a credit card that's also saved in your Google Payments account, you will be redirected to Google Payments to complete the deletion.\nAfter your card has been deleted from your Google Payments account, Chrome will automatically remove that card from your Autofill suggestions.\n</p>\n<p>To save a card locally on the device only, while still being signed in to Chrome with a Google Account, you can add a card from the \u201cAdd\u201d button in the \u201cPayment methods\u201d section in Chrome settings.\nIf you would like to sign into Google web services, like google.com, without Chrome asking whether you want to save your info to your Google Account, you can turn off Chrome sign-in.\nIf you have sync turned on, you can disable syncing payment methods and addresses to Google Pay under \u201cSync\u201d in Chrome settings.\nYou can also turn the Payments Autofill feature off altogether in settings.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome also supports the PaymentRequest API by allowing you to pay for purchases with credit cards from Autofill, Google Payments, and other payment apps already installed on your device.\nGoogle Payments and other payment apps are only available on Android devices.\nPaymentRequest allows the merchant to request the following information: full name, shipping address, billing address, phone number, email, credit card number, credit card expiration, CVV, and Google Payments credentials.\nInformation is not shared with the merchant until you agree.\n</p> Geolocation <p>Google Chrome supports the Geolocation API, which provides access to fine-grained user location information with your consent.\n</p>\n<p>By default, Chrome will request your permission when a web page asks for your location information, and does not send any location information to the web page unless you explicitly consent.\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore, whenever you are on a web page which is using your location information, Chrome will display a location icon on the right side of the omnibox.\nYou can click on this icon in order to find out more information or manage location settings.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>In Chrome\u2019s settings, by clicking \u201cSite Settings\u201d and scrolling to the \u201cLocation\u201d section, you can choose to allow all sites to receive your location information, have Chrome ask you every time (the default), or block all sites from receiving your location information.\nYou can also configure exceptions for specific web sites.\n</p>\n<p>In the Android version of Chrome, your default search engine automatically receives your location when you conduct a search.\nOn the iOS version of Chrome, by default your location is sent to Google if you conduct a search from the omnibox.\nRead more about how your default search engine handles geolocation and how to manage your settings in the Omnibox section of the whitepaper.\n</p>\n<p>If you do choose to share your location with a web site, Chrome will send local network information to Google (also used by other browsers such as Mozilla Firefox) in order to estimate your location.\nThis local network information can include data about nearby Wi-Fi access points or cellular signal sites/towers (even if you\u2019re not using them), and your computer\u2019s IP address.\nThe requests are logged, and aggregated and anonymized before being used to operate, support, and improve the overall quality of Google Chrome and Google Location Services.\n</p>\n<p>For further reading on the privacy and user interface implications of the Geolocation API (as well as other HTML5 APIs), see \u201dPractical Privacy Concerns in a Real World Browser\u201d written by two Google Chrome team members.\n</p> Speech to text <p>Chrome supports the Web Speech API, a mechanism for converting speech to text on a web page.\nIt uses Google's servers to perform the conversion.\nUsing the feature sends an audio recording to Google (audio data is not sent directly to the page itself), along with the domain of the website using the API, your default browser language and the language settings of the website.\nCookies are not sent along with these requests.\n</p> Google Assistant on Chrome OS devices <p>The Google Assistant is integrated into some models of Chrome OS devices.\nIf you opt in to the feature, Chrome OS listens for you to say \"Ok Google\" and sends the audio of the next thing you say, plus a few seconds before, to Google.\nDetection of the phrase \"Ok Google\" is performed locally on your computer, and the audio is only sent to Google after it detects \"Ok Google\".\nYou can enable or disable this feature in Google Assistant Settings.\n</p>\n<p>Enabling this feature in Chrome Settings will cause Chrome to listen whenever the screen is unlocked.\nOn Chrome OS devices with a local audio processor, the device also listens when the device is asleep.\nOn these devices, The Google Assistant feature only works if Voice &amp.\nAudio Activity is enabled for your Google account.\nChrome will prompt you to enable Voice &amp.\nAudio Activity for the associated Google account if it is disabled.\n</p>\n<p>Once the audio has been converted to text, a search with that text is submitted to Google.\nIf you have used the \u201cOk Google\u201d search before on a device but turned off Voice &amp.\nAudio Activity later, your device is still capable of processing your voice and sending the audio to Google but the voice is deleted shortly thereafter.\n</p>\n<p>You can determine your Chrome OS device\u2019s behavior by examining the text in the \"Search and Assistant\" section of settings.\n</p> Google Assistant on Android devices <p>You can quickly complete tasks on the web using the Google Assistant in Chrome on certain Android devices .\nIf you opt-in to this feature, you can speak to the Google Assistant and ask it to search websites.\nIt also can fill out forms on your behalf, or speed up the checkout experience.\n</p>\n<p>For example, if you issue a command to the Google Assistant e.g.\n\u201csearch Wikipedia for Henry VIII\u201d, the Google Assistant in Chrome will respond by opening Chrome to Wikipedia, sending the query as a text string to Google Assistant in Chrome, and searching for \u201cHenry VIII\u201d on the Wikipedia page.\n</p>\n<p>As another example, if you ask the Google Assistant to help you purchase tickets for an upcoming movie, then the address of the website you are viewing, your credit card information, and your email address will be shared with Google to complete the transaction and make it possible for you to receive the purchase receipt and movie ticket.\n</p>\n<p>If you opt-in to this feature, the Google Assistant in Chrome will send data to Google in order to complete the command you issued.\nWhen the command is issued, the Google Assistant in Chrome shares back to Google the website\u2019s URL to validate that the webpage is allowed to be automated by Google Assistant in Chrome and to receive the instructions on how to complete the task (e.g.\non how to fill out a form).\n</p>\n<p>At the time the command you issued is executed, additional information can be shared.\nDepending on the command you issued, the information shared with Google can include the address of the website you are viewing, your email address, your name, your delivery and billing address, your credit card information, and possibly the username you use to log into the website.\nThis information is not stored by Google \u2014 rather, this information is passed on to the third party website to complete the command you issued to the Google Assistant.\nAdditionally, information about your system is collected in order to improve the product and to debug issues.\n</p>\n<p>To personalize future actions Google Assistant in Chrome will save configuration information about the command you issued to improve your future experiences (for example: seat selections, number and types of movie tickets, etc.).\nThis information is saved to your Google Account.\n</p>\n<p>Some Google Assistant features are not available on Incognito tabs.\nYou can turn off the ability to use the Google Assistant in Chrome on your Android device by toggling the \u201cGoogle Assistant for Chrome\u201d option in Chrome\u2019s settings.\n</p> Google Cloud Print <p>The Google Cloud Print feature allows you to print documents from your browser over the Internet.\nYou do not need a direct connection between the machine that executes Chrome and your printer.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to print a web page via Cloud Print, Chrome will generate a PDF of this website and upload it over an encrypted network connection to Google\u2019s servers.\nIf you choose to print other kinds of documents, they may be uploaded as raw documents to Google\u2019s servers.\n</p>\n<p>A print job will be downloaded by either a Chrome browser (\u201cConnector\u201d) or a Cloud Print capable printer that you selected when printing the website.\nIn some cases the print job must be submitted to a third-party service to print (HP\u2019s ePrint, for example).\n</p>\n<p>The print job is deleted from Google\u2019s servers when any of three criteria is met: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You delete the print job </li>\n<li>The job has been printed and marked as printed by the printer/connector </li>\n<li>The job has been queued on Google\u2019s servers for 30 days </li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can manage your printers and print jobs on the Google Cloud Print website.\n</p> SSL certificate reporting <p>Chrome stores locally a list of expected SSL certificate information for a variety of high-value websites, in an effort to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.\nFor Google websites and other websites that choose to opt in, Chrome will report a possible attack or misconfiguration.\nIf the certificate provided by the web server doesn\u2019t match the expected signature, Chrome reports information about the SSL certificate chain to Google or to a report collection endpoint of the website's choosing.\nChrome sends these reports only for certificate chains that use a public root of trust.\n</p>\n<p>You can enable this feature by opting in to report data relevant to security, as described in the Safe Browsing section.\nWhile you are opted in, two kinds of reports may be sent to Google\u2019s security team.\nEach time you see an SSL error page, a report will be sent containsing the SSL certificate chain, the server's hostname, the local time, and relevant details about the validation error and SSL error page type.\nAdditionally, each time a mismatch between different certificate verifiers is detected, a report will be sent containing the certificate chain and the verification result.\n</p>\n<p>Because Chrome sends these reports for all certificate chains, even those that chain to a private root of trust, these chains can contain personally identifiable information.\nYou can opt out anytime by unchecking the box \u201cHelp Improve Chrome security\u201d in \u201cPrivacy and security &gt.\nSecurity\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>The SSL certificate reporting feature is not available on Chrome iOS.\n</p> Installed Applications and Extensions <p>Users can install external apps and extensions for the desktop versions of Chrome to add features to or customize their Chrome browsers.\nInstalling an application or extension from the Chrome Web Store directly or via an inline installation flow on a third-party site involves a request to the Chrome Web Store for details about the application.\nThis request includes cookies, and if you\u2019re logged into Google when you install an application, that installation is recorded as part of your Google account.\nThe store uses this information to recommend applications to you in the future, and in aggregate to evaluate application popularity and usage.\nAs noted above, applications and extensions are updated via Google Update.\n</p>\n<p>As they're more deeply integrated into Chrome, applications and extensions that you choose to install can request access to additional capabilities, enabling functionality that doesn't make sense on the web at large: background notifications or raw socket access, for instance.\nThese additional permissions may change the way your data is collected and shared, as extensions and applications might have access to data regarding the websites you visit, and might be capable of monitoring or modifying your interactions with the web.\nWhen installing an application or extension, Chrome may first warn you about certain capabilities.\nPlease do take the time to read and evaluate this warning before proceeding with the installation.\nNote also that interactions with and data collected by these third-party applications and extensions are governed by their own privacy policies, not Google's privacy policy.\n</p> Push messaging <p>Your device may receive push messages from the backend servers of apps and extensions installed in Chrome, websites that you grant the \u201cnotification\u201d permission to, and your default search engine.\nDisabling push messages from your default search engine is done in the same way as disabling push messages from any site, by visiting the \u201cNotifications\u201d section of \u201cSite settings\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>Push message data is sent over a secure channel from the developer through Google\u2019s infrastructure to Chrome on your device, which can wake up apps, extensions, and websites (including your default search engine) to deliver the message.\nThe developer may end-to-end encrypt the message data, or may send it in a form such that Google servers process it as plain text.\nGoogle servers retain up to 4 weeks\u2019 worth of messages to ensure delivery to users even if their devices are offline at the time of the initial pushing.\n</p>\n<p>If the notification permission is set to \u201cgranted\u201d for any website (including the default search engine), or you have an app or extension installed that uses push messaging, then Chrome provides the app\u2019s, extension\u2019s, or website\u2019s server with one or more registration tokens that can be used to send messages to the entity (app, extension, or website).\nWebsites you visit in Incognito mode are not allowed to send you push messages and therefore cannot get a registration token.\n</p>\n<p>When you uninstall an app or extension, revoke the notification permission for a website, or clear cookies for a permitted website, its registration token is revoked and will not be reused, even if the same app or extension is re-installed or the same website is re-visited.\nRegistration tokens used by Chrome components such as Sync are revoked once they are no longer in use (for example, when the user disables Sync).\nWhen a registration token is revoked, the associated entity on your device stops receiving messages sent from its developer\u2019s server.\n</p>\n<p>The registration tokens that are passed to entities contain an encrypted device ID, which is used for routing the messages.\nGoogle can decrypt the device ID, but other entities cannot, and the encryption is designed so that two registration tokens for the same device ID cannot be correlated.\nOn desktop versions of Chrome, the device ID is reset when the Chrome profile is removed, or when neither Chrome Sync nor any of the entities requires it for push messaging.\nOn Android, the lifetime of the device ID is governed by the operating system and is independent of Chrome.\nAny messages routed to registration tokens containing a revoked device ID will not be delivered.\n</p> Chrome custom tabs <p>On Android devices, an app developer may use a Custom Tab to show web content when you click on a URL from their app.\nA Custom Tab may look different from a regular Chrome tab, for example it may have app-specified visual style, and the absence of an editable URL bar.\nDespite the different visual style a Custom Tab may have, the data sent and received in the Custom Tab, such as cookies, saved passwords and browsing history function the same way they do in a normal Chrome tab.\nThe Custom Tab is an app-customized view using the same underlying user profile.\n</p>\n<p>With Chrome Custom Tabs, an Android app developer may also specify custom actions in the Chrome toolbar and overflow menu that are relevant to their app, for example,\"share\", \u201csave page\u201d, \u201ccopy URL\u201d.\nIf you tap on such a button, the address of the current website is shared with the application.\n</p>\n<p>An application can request Chrome to pre-render a given URL in the background.\nThis allows Chrome to show you a pre-loaded site instantly when you open it from the app.\nAt the same time it allows an application to set cookies in your browser in the background.\nTo disable pre-rendering, you can uncheck \"Preload pages for faster browsing and searching\" in the \u201cPrivacy and security &gt.\nCookies\u201d section of Chrome\u2019s settings.\n</p>\n<p>Trusted Web Activities are a form of Chrome Custom Tab where the top bar is not present, allowing web browsing with no browser UI but with access to the cookie jar.\nThey can only be used to view web content on an origin that the client app can prove that it owns using Digital Asset Links.\nIf the user navigates off this origin the the top bar reappears.\n</p>\n<p>When the client app is uninstalled or has its data cleared through Android Settings, Chrome will allow the user to clear data for the linked origin.\n</p> Continue where you left off <p>If you have selected the option to \u201cContinue where you left off\u201d in settings on desktop versions of Chrome, when you open Chrome, it attempts to bring you right back to the way things were when the browser was closed.\nChrome reloads the tabs you had open and persists session information to get you up and running as quickly as possible.\nThis feature effectively extends a browsing session across restarts.\nIn this mode, session cookies are no longer deleted when the browser closes.\ninstead, they remain available on restart to keep you logged into your favorite sites.\n</p>\n<p>On desktop versions of Chrome, this feature can be enabled or disabled in Chrome settings.\nOn Chrome OS, it is enabled by default.\n</p>\n<p>On OS X, when you restart your device, a checkbox in the OS confirmation dialog asks you whether you want to re-open applications and windows after restart.\nIf you check this box, Chrome restores tabs and windows, as well as the session cookies, even if you have disabled \"Continue where you left off\" on Chrome.\n</p>\n<p>On mobile versions of Chrome, this feature is always enabled without a setting.\n</p> Chrome Variations <p>Chrome is constantly evolving to better meet the needs of users and the web.\nTo ensure new features are providing the best experience and working correctly, they may be enabled for a subset of users before they are fully launched.\nFor example, if we improve how page loading works in Chrome, we may try it out for 1% of users to ensure that it doesn't crash or run slower before launching to everyone.\nThis is done through a system called \"Chrome Variations\" - also known as \"field trials\".\n</p>\n<p>A given Chrome installation may be participating in a number of different variations (for different features) at the same time.\nThese fall into two categories: </p>\n<ol>\n<li> Low entropy variations, which are randomized based on a number from 0 to 7999 (13 bits) that's randomly generated by each Chrome installation on the first run.\n</li>\n<li> High entropy variations, which are randomized using the usage statistics token for Chrome installations that have usage statistics reporting enabled.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Other factors may additionally inform the variations assigned to a Chrome installation, such as country (determined by your IP address), operating system, Chrome version and other parameters.\n</p>\n<p>Usage statistics and crash reports are tagged with all variations a client participates in, including both low entropy and high entropy variations.\nThese reports, which also contain a pseudonymous client identifier, can be disabled in Chrome settings.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, a subset of low entropy variations are included in network requests sent to Google.\nThe combined state of these variations is non-identifying, since it is based on a 13-bit low entropy value (see above).\nThese are transmitted using the \"X-Client-Data\" HTTP header, which contains a list of active variations.\nOn Android, this header may include a limited set of external server-side experiments, which may affect the Chrome installation.\nThis header is used to evaluate the effect on Google servers - for example, a networking change may affect YouTube video load speed or an Omnibox ranking update may result in more helpful Google Search results.\n</p>\n<p>On Android Chrome, in certain cases these low entropy variations may also be sent to Google apps when cross-app communication occurs to support a Chrome feature.\nfor example, when searching with Google Lens.\nThis information is used to better understand how Chrome experiments affect that Google feature: for example, Chrome memory usage change could affect how long it takes an action in the Google app to complete.\n</p>\n<p>You can reset the variations used by your Chrome installation by starting it with the \u201c--reset-variation-state\u201d command line flag.\n</p> Do Not Track <p>If you enable the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d preference in Chrome\u2019s settings, Chrome will send a DNT:1 HTTP header with your outgoing HTTP, HTTPS and SPDY browsing traffic (Chrome cannot, however, guarantee that NPAPI plugins also send the header.) The header will not be sent with system traffic such as the geolocation, metrics or device management services.\n</p>\n<p>The effect of Do Not Track depends on whether a website responds to the request, and how the request is interpreted.\nFor example, some websites may respond to this request by showing you ads that aren't based on other websites you've visited.\nMany websites will still collect and use your browsing data - for example, to improve security.\nto provide content, services, ads and recommendations on their websites.\nand to generate reporting statistics.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome on iOS now uses WKWebView to provide a more stable and faster browser.\nAs a result of this move, the Do Not Track preference is no longer available due to iOS constraints.\nIf Apple makes changes to allow this feature, Chrome will make Do Not Track available again in iOS.\n</p> Plugins <p>Chrome ships with an Adobe Flash Player implementation that is based on the Pepper API.\nFlash and other Pepper-based plugins may ask you for \u201cAccess to your computer\u201d.\nIf you grant this permission, the plugin is granted unsandboxed access.\nThis allows content providers to offer you access to DRM protected content like videos or music but may have security and privacy implications, so consider carefully whether you trust a plugin or website with this privilege.\n</p> Media licenses <p>Some websites encrypt media to protect against unauthorized access and copying.\nWhen users play media from these sites, they typically log into the site, which authenticates the user, and then digital rights management negotiates a key exchange for the decryption and playback of the media.\n</p>\n<p>For HTML5 sites, this key exchange is done using the Encrypted Media Extensions API.\nThe implementation of that API is tightly coupled with the browser to protect user privacy and security, through Content Decryption Modules (CDM), which are provided by digital rights management solutions such as Google Widevine or Microsoft PlayReady.\n</p>\n<p>When a user asks Chrome to play encrypted HTML5 media (for example, watching a movie on Google Play Movies), Chrome will generate a request for a license to decrypt that media.\nThis license request contains an automatically generated request ID, which is created by the Content Decryption Module, as well as proof that the CDM is legitimate.\nAfter generation, the license request is typically sent to a license server managed by either the content website or Google.\nNeither the license request, the proof, nor the request ID include any personally identifying information.\nAfter being sent, the license request is not stored locally on the user\u2019s device.\n</p>\n<p>As part of the license request, Chrome also generates a unique session ID which does not contain personally identifying information.\nThis session ID is sent to the license server, and when the server returns a license the session ID is used to decrypt the media.\nThe session ID may be stored locally even after the site has been closed.\nThe license may also be stored locally for offline consumption of protected content.\nSession ID and licenses may be cleared by the user in Chrome using Clear Browsing Data with \u201cCookies and other site data\u201d selected.\n</p>\n<p>When returning a license, the site license server may include a client ID, generated by the site.\nThis client ID is unique to the user and the site, it is not shared between sites.\nIf provided, the client ID is stored locally and included by Chrome in subsequent license requests to that site.\nThe client ID may be cleared by the user in Chrome using Clear Browsing Data with \u201cCookies and other site data\u201d selected.\n</p>\n<p>On some platforms, the website may additionally request verification that the device is eligible to play specific types of protected content.\nOn Chrome OS, this is known as Verified Access.\nIn this case, Google creates a certificate using a unique hardware identifier for the device.\nThis hardware ID identifies the device, but does not identify the user.\nIf the user agrees, Google receives the hardware ID and generates a certificate verifying the device for the requested site.\nThe certificate does not include the hardware ID or any other information that could permanently identify the device.\nCertificates are stored locally similar to other cached browsing data, and may be cleared by the user in Chrome using Clear Browsing Data with \u201cCookies and other site data\u201d selected.\nOn Android, this is called Provisioning.\nSee \u201cMediaDrm Provisioning\u201d for more details.\n</p>\n<p>Some sites use Flash instead of HTML5.\nIf a website you visit chooses to use Adobe Flash Access DRM protection, Chrome for Windows and Chrome OS will give Adobe Flash access to a device identifier.\nYou can deny this access in the settings under Content Settings, Protected content, and reset the ID using Clear Browsing Data with \u201cCookies and other site data\u201d selected.\n</p>\n<p>In order to give you access to licensed music, the Google Play Music app can retrieve a device identifier that is derived from your hard drive partitions or, on a Chrome OS or Linux installation, from a unique file on your disk.\nThis identifier can be reset by reinstalling your operating system.\n</p> MediaDrm provisioning <p>Chrome on Android uses Android MediaDrm to play protected content.\nAs on ChromeOS, the website may request verification that the device is eligible to do so.\nThis is achieved by MediaDrm provisioning.\nA provisioning request is sent to Google, which generates a certificate that will be stored on the device and sent to the site whenever you play protected content.\nThe information in the provisioning request and in the certificate vary depending on the Android version.\nIn all cases, the information can be used to identify the device, but never the user.\n</p>\n<p>On Android K and L, the device only needs to be provisioned once and the certificate is shared by all applications running on the device.\nThe request contains a hardware ID, and the certificate contains a stable device ID, both of which could be used to permanently identify the device.\n</p>\n<p>On Android M or later, MediaDrm supports per-origin provisioning.\nChrome randomly generates an origin ID for each website to be provisioned.\nEven though the request still contains a hardware ID, the certificate is different for each website, so that different websites cannot cross-reference the same device.\n</p>\n<p>On Android O or later on some devices, provisioning can be scoped to a single application.\nThe request will contain a hardware ID, but the certificate will be different for each application, in addition to each site, so different applications cannot cross-reference the same device.\n</p>\n<p>Provisioning can be controlled by the \u201cProtected media\u201d permission in the \u201cSite settings\u201d menu.\nOn Android versions K and L, Chrome will always ask you to grant this permission before provisioning starts.\nOn later versions of Android, this permission is granted by default.\nYou can clear the provisioned certificates anytime using the \u201cCookies and other site data\u201d option in the Clear browsing data dialog.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome also performs MediaDrm pre-provisioning to support playback of protected content in cases where the provisioning server is not accessible, such as in-flight entertainment.\nChrome randomly generates a list of origin IDs and provision them in advance for future use.\n</p>\n<p>On Android versions with per-device provisioning, where provisioning requires a permission, Chrome does not support pre-provisioning.\nPlayback might still work because the device could have already been provisioned by other applications.\n</p>\n<p>On Android versions with per-origin provisioning, Chrome pre-provisions itself once the user attempts to play protected content.\nAs the provisioning for the first playback already involved sending a stable hardware ID to Google, the subsequent pre-provisioning of additional origin IDs introduces no new privacy implications.\nIf provisioning fails and there is no pre-provisioned origin ID, Chrome may ask for permission to further fallback to per-device provisioning.\n</p>\n<p>On devices with per-application provisioning, Chrome pre-provisions itself automatically on startup.\n</p> Cloud policy <p>When you sign into a Chrome OS device, Chrome on Android, or a desktop Chrome profile with an account associated with a Google Apps domain, or if your desktop browser is enrolled in Chrome Browser Cloud Management, Chrome checks whether the domain has configured enterprise policies.\nIf so, the Chrome OS user session, Chrome profile, or enrolled Chrome Browser is assigned a unique ID, and registered as belonging to that Google Apps domain.\nAny configured policies are applied.\nTo revoke the registration, remove the Chrome OS user, sign out of Chrome on Android, remove the desktop profile, or remove the enrollment token and device token for Chrome Browser Cloud Management.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, Chrome OS devices can be enrolled to a Google Apps domain by a domain admin.\nThis will enforce enterprise policies for the entire device, such as providing shared network configurations and restricting access to developer mode.\nWhen a Chrome OS device is enrolled to a domain, then a unique device ID is registered to the device.\nIn order to revoke the registration, the admin will need to wipe the entire Chrome OS device.\n</p>\n<p>Registered profiles and devices check for policy changes periodically (every 3 hours by default).\nIn some cases, the server pushes policy changes to the client without waiting for Chrome's periodic check.\nUnregistered profiles check whether a policy has been turned on for their domain each time Chrome starts up.\n</p>\n<p>The policy list contains details about the types of configurations that are available via Cloud Policy.\n</p> Lite Mode <p>If you enable Lite Mode (previously known as \u201cData Saver\u201d), Chrome may send your traffic through Google's optimizing servers to reduce the amount of data downloaded and speed up your page loads.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome will share the URLs you visit with Google, as well as usage and performance statistics for those sites so Chrome can better optimize them.\nCookies for sites you visit are not shared with Google.\nLogs are not associated with your Google Account, and all log entries are removed within 14 days.\nPages loaded in Incognito will not use the optimizing servers and usage and performance statistics will not be reported.\n</p> Image Compression <p>To save Lite Mode users data, image requests may be sent to a Google image optimization server which will fetch the image from the origin and return a compressed version to Chrome.\nTo avoid optimizing private images, Chrome first asks Google for a list of image URLs known to be on the page according to a crawl of the site from a Google data center.\nOnly images on that list will be sent to the optimization server.\nImage URLs on the page that were not seen during the Google crawl will not be optimized, and no information about those URLs will be sent to Google.\n</p> Using Chrome with a kid\u2019s Google Account <p>Chrome for Android offers features to be used when signed in with a kid's Google Account and automatically signs in a kid's account if they've signed into the Android device.\nChrome uses the Sync feature to sync settings configured by parents to the kid\u2019s account.\nYou can read about how Sync data is used in the Sign in section of this Whitepaper.\n</p>\n<p>The collection and use of Chrome data in association with a kid\u2019s Google Account are governed by the Google Family Link - Children\u2019s Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>In order for the configured settings to apply to a kid\u2019s account, Chrome does not support the following features for a kid\u2019s Google Account: signing out of Chrome, Incognito mode, and deleting browsing history from within Chrome.\nBrowsing history can still be removed in the Chrome section of the Google Dashboard.\n</p>\n<p>By default, first party cookie blocking is disabled when Chrome is signed in with a kid\u2019s account.\nParents can go to chrome.google.com/manage/family to allow their kids to block first party cookies.\nHowever, blocking cookies signs kids out of Google web products such as Google Search or YouTube and therefore prevents these products from providing any features designed for kids\u2019 Google Accounts.\n</p>\n<p>When Chrome is used with a kid\u2019s Google Account, information about the kid\u2019s requests to access blocked content is sent to Google and made visible to the kid\u2019s parent(s) on chrome.google.com/manage/family and in the Google Family Link app.\nIf the kid\u2019s browsing mode is set to \u201cTry to block mature sites\u201d, Chrome will send a request to the Google SafeSearch service for each navigation in order to block access to sites that have been classified as containing mature content.\n</p> Incognito and Guest Mode <p>Incognito mode in Chrome is a temporary browsing mode.\nIt ensures that you don\u2019t leave browsing history and cookies on your computer.\nThe browsing history and cookies are deleted only once you have closed the last incognito window.\nIncognito mode cannot make you invisible on the internet.\nWebsites that you navigate to may record your visits.\nGoing incognito doesn\u2019t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.\n</p>\n<p>Browsing as a Guest in Chrome allows you to use somebody else's computer without modifying their profile.\nFor example, no bookmarks or passwords get stored on their computer.\nNote that Guest mode does not protect you for example, if the computer you are using is infected by a keylogger that records what you type.\n</p> iOS 8 and Mac OS X Yosemite Handoff Support <p>While browsing in a standard (i.e.\nnon-Incognito) session, Chrome will share your current URL with iOS 8+ to support the Handoff feature that was added in OS X Yosemite.\nThis information is only sent to Apple devices that are paired with your iOS device, and the data is encrypted in transit.\n</p>\n<p>More information is available at Apple Support, Apple Developers, and in the Apple iOS Security Guide.\nChrome support for this feature can be disabled in Chrome settings.\n</p> Security Key <p>A FIDO U2F Security Key provides a non-phishable credential which can be used to authenticate a user.\nThis mitigates the risk of various kinds of man-in-the-middle attacks in which websites try to steal your password and use it later.\n</p>\n<p>To prevent abuse, a website is required to be delivered over a secure connection (HTTPS), and to register the security key before it can be used for identification.\nOnce a website is registered with a specific security key, that security key will provide a persistent identifier, regardless of which computer it is plugged into, or whether you're in incognito or guest mode, but you must physically interact with the security key to give a website access to an identifier (by, for example, touching it, or plugging it in).\n</p> Physical Web <p>The Physical Web lets you see a list of URLs being broadcast by objects in the environment around you.\nGoogle Chrome looks for Physical Web devices with Bluetooth Low Energy beacons that are broadcasting URLs using the Eddystone protocol.\nBluetooth signals can be received from 90 feet away or more, depending on signal strength and the user\u2019s environment (although the range is often much shorter, due to obstacles and signal noise).\nIf the Physical Web feature is enabled, Chrome sends detected URLs to Google\u2019s Physical Web Service (PWS) via a cookieless HTTPS request.\nFor each URL, the PWS obtains the title of the web page, filters out unsafe results, and returns a ranking based on non-personalized signals about the quality and relevance of the web page.\n</p>\n<p>The Physical Web feature is available on Chrome on iOS and Android.\nUsers will need to turn on Bluetooth to use the feature.\n</p>\n<p>If Android users have location settings enabled on both their device and in Chrome, they will receive a notification the first time they are near a beacon that will give them the option to turn on the Physical Web feature.\nThis beacon\u2019s URL is not sent to Google\u2019s PWS unless the Physical Web feature is enabled.\nUsers can also enable (or disable) the feature in the Privacy settings.\nOnce a user enables the feature, Chrome scans for nearby devices for a few seconds each time the user unlocks the mobile device in use and sends them to the PWS in order to obtain more information about the beacon.\nThe user receives a silent notification when Chrome finds a nearby URL.\n</p>\n<p>On iOS devices, users can enable (or disable) the feature in the Privacy settings or by adding the Chrome widget to their Today view in the notification center.\nAdditionally, the feature is automatically enabled for users who have location enabled on their device, granted Chrome the location permission, and have granted Google the geolocation permission.\nChrome scans for nearby devices whenever it is open in the foreground.\nWhen Chrome finds nearby URLs, users will see them as omnibox suggestions.\nAdditionally, Chrome scans for nearby devices for a few seconds when the Today widget is displayed in the notification center.\n</p> Bluetooth <p>Google Chrome supports the Web Bluetooth API, which provides websites with access to nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices with your consent.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome does not let any page communicate with a device unless you explicitly consent.\nWhen a web page asks to pair with a device, Chrome will ask you to choose which device the web page should access, if any.\nSelecting a device for one page does not give other pages access to the device you have chosen, and does not allow that page to access other devices.\nCurrently, permission for a page to communicate with a device is usually revoked when the page is reloaded, and is always revoked when Chrome is restarted.\n</p> Chrome data that Android sends to Google <p>The data collection and usage described in this section is handled by Android and governed by the Google Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>If the Android Backup Service is enabled on your device, some of your Chrome preferences will be saved and stored on Google servers.\nFor Nexus and Android One devices, it is described under \u201cBack up your data and settings with Android Backup Service\u201d in this article.\nFor other Android devices, you may be able to find help by looking up your device on this page.\nWhen setting up a new Android device, you may request that it copies the preferences from a previously set up device.\nIf you do so, Android may restore backed up Chrome preferences when Chrome is first installed.\nThe new device only copies the preferences if automatic restore is enabled (see \u201cRestore your data and settings\u201d in the same article), Chrome was signed into an account when the backup was made, and the new Android device is signed into that same account.\n</p>\n<p>Chrome\u2019s backup data for a particular device may also be restored if you uninstall and then later re-install Chrome on that device.\nThis will only happen if automatic restore is enabled and the device is signed into the account that Chrome was signed into when the backup was made.\n</p> Integration with Digital Wellbeing <p>If you opt-in to see sites you have visited and set site timers in the Digital Wellbeing app on Android, Chrome will report which websites you\u2019ve visited and the length of time spent in each of them to the app.\nSites visited in incognito mode will not be reported to the Digital Wellbeing app.\n</p>\n<p>To continually improve the experience of Digital Wellbeing, the app will share with Google the websites that you set a timer on and how long you have visited them.\n</p>\n<p>You can opt out of this feature in the Digital Wellbeing app or in Chrome\u2019s privacy settings anytime.\n</p> Follow us <ul>\n<li> Youtube </li>\n<li> Twitter

computer or mobile device, Chrome OS, and when you enable Safe Browsing in Chrome.\nAlthough this policy describes features that are specific to Chrome, any personal information that is provided to Google or stored in your Google Account will be used and protected in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy, as changed from time to time.\nGoogle\u2019s retention policy describes how and why Google retains data.\n</p>\n<p>If Google Play apps have been enabled on your Chromebook, the use and protection of information collected by Google Play or the Android operating system is governed by the Google Play Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy.\nDetails specific to Chrome are provided in this Notice where relevant.\n</p> Details about the Privacy Notice <p>In this Privacy Notice, we use the term \"Chrome\" to refer to all the products in the Chrome family listed above.\nIf there are differences in our policy between products, we'll point them out.\nWe change this Privacy Notice from time to time.\n</p>\n<p>\"Beta,\" \"Dev,\" or \"Canary\" versions of Chrome let you test new features still being created in Chrome.\nThis Privacy Notice applies to all versions of Chrome, but might not be up-to-date for features still under development.\n</p>\n<p>For step-by-step guides to managing your privacy preferences, read this overview of Chrome's privacy controls.\n</p> Table of

browsing experience.\nPrivacy practices are different depending on the mode that you're using.\n</p> Basic browser mode <p>The basic browser mode stores information locally on your system.\nThis information might include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Browsing history information.\nFor example, Chrome stores the URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages, and, if the network actions prediction feature is turned on, a list of some of the IP addresses linked from those pages.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personal information and passwords, to help you

dialog.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can stop Chrome from accepting cookies.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can review stored passwords in Chrome settings.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can view and manage your stored Autofill information.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The personal information that Chrome stores won't be sent to Google unless you choose to store that data in your Google Account by turning on sync, or, in the case of passwords, payment cards, and billing information, choosing specific credentials or payment card and billing information to store in your Google Account.\nLearn More.\n</p> How Chrome handles your information <p>\n<strong>Information for website operators.</strong> Sites that you visit using Chrome will automatically receive standard log information, including your system\u2019s IP address and data from cookies.\nIn general, the fact that you use Chrome to access Google services, such as Gmail, does not cause Google to receive any additional personally identifying information about you.\nOn Google websites and other websites that opt in, if Chrome detects signs that you are being actively attacked by someone on the network (a \"man in the middle attack\"), Chrome may send information about that connection to Google or the website you visited to help determine the extent of the attack and how the attack functions.\nGoogle provides participating website owners with reports about attacks occurring on their sites.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Prerendering.</strong> To load web pages faster, Chrome has a setting that can look up the IP addresses of links on a web page and open network connections.\nSites and Android apps can also ask the browser to preload the pages you might visit next.\nPreloading requests from Android apps are controlled by the same setting as Chrome-initiated predictions.\nBut preloading instructions from sites are always performed, regardless of whether Chrome\u2019s network prediction feature is enabled.\nIf prerendering is requested, whether by Chrome or by a site or app, the preloaded site is allowed to set and read its own cookies just as if you had visited it, even if you don\u2019t end up visiting the prerendered page.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location.</strong> To get more geographically relevant information, Chrome gives you the option to share your location with a site.\nChrome won't allow a site to access your location without your permission.\nhowever, on mobile devices, Chrome automatically shares your location with your default search engine if the Chrome app has permission to access your location and you haven\u2019t blocked geolocation for the associated web site.\nChrome uses Google Location Services to estimate your location.\nThe information that Chrome sends to Google Location Services may include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Wi-Fi routers closest to you </li>\n<li>Cell IDs of the cell towers closest to you </li>\n<li>The strength of your Wi-Fi or cell signal </li>\n<li>The IP address that is currently assigned to your device </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google doesn't have control over third-party websites or their privacy practices, so be cautious when sharing your location with a website.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Updates.</strong> Chrome periodically sends information to Google to check for updates, get connectivity status, validate the current time, and estimate the number of active users.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Search features.</strong> If you are signed in to a Google site and Google is your default search engine, searches you perform using the omnibox or the search box on the new tab page in Chrome are stored in your Google Account.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Search prediction service.</strong> To help you find information faster, Chrome uses the prediction service provided by your default search engine to offer likely completions to the text you are typing.\nWhen you search using the omnibox or the search box on the new tab page in Chrome, the characters you type (even if you haven\u2019t hit \"enter\" yet) are sent to your default search engine.\nIf Google is your default search engine, predictions are based on your own search history, topics related to what you\u2019re typing in the omnibox or in the search box on the new tab page, and what other people are searching for.\nLearn more.\nPredictions can also be based on your browsing history.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Navigation assistance.</strong> When you can\u2019t connect to a web page, you can get suggestions for alternative pages similar to the one you're trying to reach.\nIn order to offer you suggestions, Chrome sends Google the URL of the page you're trying to reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Autofill, password management, and payments.</strong> In order to improve Chrome\u2019s Autofill and password management services, Chrome sends Google limited, anonymous information about the web forms that you encounter or submit while Autofill or password management is enabled, including a hashed URL of the web page and details of the form's structure.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>When you are signed into Chrome with your Google Account, Chrome may offer to save passwords, payment methods and related information to your Google Account.\nChrome may also offer you the option of filling passwords and payment methods from your Google Account into web forms.\nIf you have passwords or payment methods saved locally in Chrome, Chrome may prompt you to save them to your Google Account.\nIf you use a payment method from your Google Account or choose to save your payment method in your Google Account for future use, Chrome will collect information about your computer and share it with Google Pay to protect you from fraud and provide the service.\nIf supported by the merchant, Chrome will also allow you to pay using Google Pay.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Language.</strong> In order to customize your browsing experience based on the languages that you prefer to read, Chrome will keep a count of the most popular languages of the sites you visit.\nThis language preference will be sent to Google to customize your experience in Chrome.\nIf you have turned on Chrome sync, this language profile will be associated with your Google Account and, if you include Chrome history in your Google Web &amp.\nApp Activity, it may be used to personalize your experience in other Google products.\nView Activity Controls.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web Apps on Android.</strong> On Android devices, if you select \"add to homescreen\" for a website that has been optimized for fast, reliable performance on mobile devices, then Chrome will use a Google server to create a native Android package for that website on your device.\nThe Android package allows you to interact with the web app as you would with an Android app.\nFor example, the web app will appear in your list of installed apps.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Usage statistics and crash reports.</strong> By default, usage statistics and crash reports are sent to Google to help us improve our products.\nUsage statistics contain information such as preferences, button clicks, performance statistics, and memory usage.\nIn general, usage statistics do not include web page URLs or personal information, but, if you have turned on \"Make searches and browsing better / Sends URLs of pages you visit to Google\", then Chrome usage statistics include information about the web pages you visit and your usage of them.\nIf you have enabled Chrome sync, Chrome may combine any declared age and gender information from your Google account with our statistics to help us build products better suited for all demographics.\nFor example, we may collect statistics to identify web pages that load slowly.\nWe use this information to improve our products and services, and to give web developers insight into improving their pages.\nCrash reports contain system information at the time of the crash, and may contain web page URLs or personal information, depending on what was happening at the time the crash report was triggered.\nWe may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with partners \u2014 like publishers, advertisers or web developers.\nYou can change whether usage statistics and crash reports are sent to Google at any time.\nLearn more.\nIf Google Play apps are enabled on your Chromebook and Chrome usage statistics are enabled, then Android diagnostic and usage data is also sent to Google.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Media licenses.</strong> Some websites encrypt media to protect against unauthorized access and copying.\nFor HTML5 sites, this key exchange is done using the Encrypted Media Extensions API.\nIn the process of allowing access to this media, session identifiers and licenses may be stored locally.\nThese identifiers can be cleared by the user in Chrome using Clear Browsing Data with \"Cookies and other site data\" selected.\nFor sites that use Adobe Flash Access, Chrome will provide a unique identifier to content partners and websites.\nThe identifier is stored on your system.\nYou can deny this access in the settings under Content Settings, Protected content, and reset the ID using Clear Browsing Data with \"Cookies and other site data\" selected.\nIf you access protected content in Chrome on Android, or access higher quality or offline content on Chrome OS, a content provider may ask Chrome for a certificate to verify the eligibility of the device.\nYour device will share a site specific identifier with the website to certify that its cryptographic keys are protected by Chrome hardware.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Google services.</strong> This notice describes the Google services that are enabled by default in Chrome.\nIn addition, Chrome may offer other Google web services.\nFor example, if you encounter a page in a different language, Chrome will offer to send the text to Google for translation.\nYou will be notified of your options for controlling these services when you first use them.\nYou can find more information in the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper.\n</p> Identifiers in Chrome <p>Chrome includes a number of unique and non-unique identifiers necessary to power features and functional services.\nFor example, if you use push messaging, an identifier is created in order to deliver notices to you.\nWhere possible, we use non-unique identifiers and remove identifiers when they are no longer needed.\nAdditionally, the following identifiers help us develop, distribute, and promote Chrome, but are not directly related to a Chrome feature.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Installation tracking.</strong> Each copy of the Windows desktop version of the Chrome browser includes a temporary randomly generated installation number that is sent to Google when you install and first use Chrome.\nThis temporary identifier helps us estimate the number of installed browsers, and will be deleted the first time Chrome updates.\nThe mobile version of Chrome uses a variant of the device identifier on an ongoing basis to track the number of installations of Chrome.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Promotion tracking.</strong> In order to help us track the success of promotional campaigns, Chrome generates a unique token that is sent to Google when you first run and use the browser.\nIn addition, if you received or reactivated your copy of the desktop version of the Chrome browser as part of a promotional campaign and Google is your default search engine, then searches from the omnibox will include a non-unique promotional tag.\nAll mobile versions of the Chrome browser also include a non-unique promotional tag with searches from the omnibox.\nChrome OS may also send a non-unique promotional tag to Google periodically (including during initial setup) and when performing searches with Google.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Field trials.</strong> We sometimes conduct limited tests of new features.\nChrome includes a seed number that is randomly selected on first run to assign browsers to experiment groups.\nExperiments may also be limited by country (determined by your IP address), operating system, Chrome version, and other parameters.\nA list of field trials that are currently active on your installation of Chrome is included in all requests sent to Google.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Sign-in and Sync Chrome modes <p>You also have the option to use the Chrome browser while signed in to your Google Account, with or without sync enabled.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sign in.</strong> On desktop versions of Chrome, signing into or out of any Google web service, like google.com, signs you into or out of Chrome.\nYou can turn this off in settings.\nLearn more.\nOn Chrome on Android, when you sign into any Google web service, Chrome may offer to sign you in with the Google Accounts that are already signed in on the device.\nYou can turn this off in settings.\nLearn more.\nIf you are signed in to Chrome with your Google Account, Chrome may offer to save your passwords, payment methods and related information to your Google Account.\nThis personal information will be used and protected in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sync.</strong> When you sign in to the Chrome browser or a Chromebook and enable sync with your Google Account, your personal information is saved in your Google Account on Google's servers so you may access it when you sign in and sync to Chrome on other computers and devices.\nThis personal information will be used and protected in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.\nThis type of information can include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browsing history </li>\n<li>Bookmarks </li>\n<li>Tabs </li>\n<li>Passwords and Autofill information </li>\n<li>Other browser settings, like installed extensions </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sync is only enabled if you choose.\nLearn More.\nTo customize the specific information that you have enabled to sync, use the \"Settings\" menu.\nLearn more.\nYou can see the amount of Chrome data stored for your Google Account and manage it at Chrome data from your account.\nOn the Dashboard, except for Google Accounts created through Family Link, you can also disable sync and delete all the associated data from Google\u2019s servers.\nLearn more.\nFor Google Accounts created in Family Link, sign-in is required and sync cannot be disabled because it provides parent management features, such as website restrictions.\nHowever, children with Family Link accounts can still delete their data and disable synchronization of most data types.\nLearn More.\nThe Privacy Notice for Google Accounts created in Family Link applies to Chrome sync data stored in those accounts.\n</p> How Chrome handles your synced information <p>When you enable sync with your Google Account, we use your browsing data to improve and personalize your experience within Chrome.\nYou can also personalize your experience on other Google products, by allowing your Chrome history to be included in your Google Web &amp.\nApp Activity.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>You can change this setting on your Account History page or manage your private data whenever you like.\nIf you don't use your Chrome data to personalize your Google experience outside of Chrome, Google will only use your Chrome data after it's anonymized and aggregated with data from other users.\nGoogle uses this data to develop new features, products, and services, and to improve the overall quality of existing products and services.\nIf you would like to use Google's cloud to store and sync your Chrome data but you don't want Google to access the data, you can encrypt your synced Chrome data with your own sync passphrase.\nLearn more.\n</p> Incognito mode and guest mode <p>You can limit the information Chrome stores on your system by using incognito mode or guest mode.\nIn these modes, Chrome won't store certain information, such as: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic browsing history information like URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you visit </li>\n<li>Snapshots of pages that you visit </li>\n<li>Records of your downloads, although the files you download will still be stored elsewhere on your computer or device </li>\n</ul> How Chrome handles your incognito or guest information <p>\n<strong>Cookies.</strong> Chrome won't share existing cookies with sites you visit in incognito or guest mode.\nSites may deposit new cookies on your system while you are in these modes, but they'll only be stored and transmitted until you close the last incognito or guest window.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Browser configuration changes.</strong> When you make changes to your browser configuration, like bookmarking a web page or changing your settings, this information is saved.\nThese changes are not affected by incognito or guest mode.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Permissions.</strong> Permissions you grant in incognito mode are not saved to your existing profile.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Profile information.</strong> In incognito mode, you will still have access to information from your existing profile, such as suggestions based on your browsing history and saved passwords, while you are browsing.\nIn guest mode, you can browse without seeing information from any existing profiles.\n</p> Managing Users in Chrome Managing users for personal Chrome use <p>You can set up personalized versions of Chrome for users sharing one device or computer.\nNote that anyone with access to your device can view all the information in all profiles.\nTo truly protect your data from being seen by others, use the built-in user accounts in your operating system.\nLearn more.\n</p> Managing users on Chrome for Enterprise <p>Some Chrome browsers or Chromebooks are managed by a school or company.\nIn that case, the administrator has the ability to apply policies to the browser or Chromebook.\nChrome contacts Google to check for these policies when a user first starts browsing (except in guest mode).\nChrome checks periodically for updates to policies.\n</p>\n<p>An administrator can set up a policy for status and activity reporting for Chrome, including location information for Chrome OS devices.\nYour administrators may also have the ability to access, monitor, use or disclose data accessed from your managed device.\n</p> Safe Browsing practices <p>Google Chrome and certain third-party browsers, like some versions of Mozilla Firefox and Apple\u2019s Safari, include Google's Safe Browsing feature.\nWith Safe Browsing, information about suspicious websites is sent and received between the browser you are using and Google's servers.\n</p> How Safe Browsing works <p>Your browser contacts Google's servers periodically to download the most recent \"Safe Browsing\" list, which contains known phishing and malware sites.\nThe most recent copy of the list is stored locally on your system.\nGoogle doesn't collect any account information or other personally identifying information as part of this contact.\nHowever, it does receive standard log information, including an IP address and cookies.\n</p>\n<p>Each site you visit is checked against the Safe Browsing list on your system.\nIf there's a match, your browser sends Google a hashed, partial copy of the site\u2019s URL so that Google can send more information to your browser.\nGoogle cannot determine the real URL from this information.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n<p>The following Safe Browsing features are specific to Chrome: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you have turned on Safe Browsing\u2019s Enhanced Protection mode, Chrome provides additional protections, and sends Google additional data, as described in Chrome settings.\nLearn more.\nSome of these protections may also be available as standalone features, subject to separate controls, where Standard Protection is enabled.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have turned on \"Make searches and browsing better / Sends URLs of pages you visit to Google\u201d and Safe Browsing is enabled, Chrome sends Google the full URL of each site you visit to determine whether that site is safe.\nIf you also sync your browsing history without a sync passphrase, these URLs will be temporarily associated with your Google account to provide more personalized protection.\nThis feature is disabled in incognito and guest modes.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some versions of Chrome feature Safe Browsing technology that can identify potentially harmful sites and potentially dangerous file types not already known by Google.\nThe full URL of the site or potentially dangerous file might also be sent to Google to help determine whether the site or file is harmful.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chrome uses Safe Browsing technology to scan your computer periodically, in order to detect unwanted software that prevents you from changing your settings or otherwise interferes with the security and stability of your browser.\nLearn more.\nIf this kind of software is detected, Chrome might offer you the option to download the Chrome Cleanup Tool to remove it.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can choose to send additional data to help improve Safe Browsing when you access a site that appears to contain malware or when Chrome detects unwanted software on your computer.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use Chrome\u2019s password manager, Safe Browsing checks with Google when you enter any saved password on an uncommon page to protect you from phishing attacks.\nChrome does not send your passwords to Google as part of this protection.\nIn addition, Safe Browsing protects your Google Account password.\nIf you enter it on a likely phishing site, Chrome will prompt you to change your Google Account password.\nIf you sync your browsing history, or if you are signed in to your Google Account and choose to notify Google, Chrome will also flag your Google Account as likely phished.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are signed in to your Google Account, Chrome will also warn you when you use a username and password that may have been exposed in a data breach.\nTo check, when you sign in to a site, Chrome sends Google a partial hash of your username and other encrypted information about your password, and Google returns a list of possible matches from known breaches.\nChrome uses this list to determine whether your username and password were exposed.\nGoogle does not learn your username or password, or whether they were exposed, as part of this process.\nThis feature can be disabled in Chrome settings.\nLearn more.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On desktop and Android versions of Chrome, you can always choose to disable the Safe Browsing feature within Chrome settings.\nOn iOS versions of Chrome, Apple controls the Safe Browsing technology used by your device and may send data to Safe Browsing providers other than Google.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Privacy practices of apps, extensions, themes, services, and other add-ons <p>You can use apps, extensions, themes, services and other add-ons with Chrome, including some that may be preinstalled or integrated with Chrome.\nAdd-ons developed and provided by Google may communicate with Google servers and are subject to the Google Privacy Policy unless otherwise indicated.\nAdd-ons developed and provided by others are the responsibility of the add-on creators and may have different privacy policies.\n</p> Managing add-ons <p>Before installing an add-on, you should review the requested permissions.\nAdd-ons can have permission to do various things, like: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Store, access, and share data stored locally or in your Google Drive account </li>\n<li>View and access content on websites you visit </li>\n<li>Use notifications that are sent through Google servers </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chrome can interact with add-ons in a few different ways: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Checking for updates </li>\n<li>Downloading and installing updates </li>\n<li>Sending usage indicators to Google about the add-ons </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some add-ons might require access to a unique identifier for digital rights management or for delivery of push messaging.\nYou can disable the use of identifiers by removing the add-on from Chrome.\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, Google might discover an add-on that poses a security threat, violates the developer terms for Chrome Web Store, or violates other legal agreements, laws, regulations, or policies.\nChrome periodically downloads a list of these dangerous add-ons, in order to remotely disable or remove them from your system.\n</p> Server Log Privacy Information <p>Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites.\nThese \"server logs\" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.\n</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a typical log entry for where the search is for \"cars\" looks like this, followed by a breakdown of its parts: </p>\n<p>\n<code>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 - https://www.google.com/search?q=cars - Firefox 1.0.7.\nWindows NT 5.1 - 740674ce2123e969</code>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>123.45.67.89</code> is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user\u2019s ISP.\nD.\ndepending on the user\u2019s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet..\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>25/Mar/2003 10:15:32</code> is the date and time of the query..\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>https://www.google.com/search?q=cars</code> is the requested URL, including the search query..\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>Firefox 1.0.7.\nWindows NT 5.1</code> is the browser and operating system being used..\n</li>\n<li>\n<code>740674ce2123a969</code> is the unique cookie ID that was assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited a Google site.\n(Cookies can be deleted by users.\nIf the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they\u2019ve/s/he visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the user the next time theys/he visits Google from that particular computer).\n</li>\n</ul> More information <p>Information that Google receives when you use Chrome is used and protected under the Google Privacy Policy.\nInformation that other website operators and add-on developers receive, including cookies, is subject to the privacy policies of those websites.\n</p>\n<p>Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others.\nRegardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in the Google Privacy Policy.\nWe also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, including the European frameworks described on our Data Transfer Frameworks page.\nLearn more.\n</p> Key Terms Cookies <p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.\nWhen you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser.\nCookies may store user preferences and other information.\nYou can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.\nLearn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.\n</p> Google Account <p>You may access some of our services by signing up for a Google Account and providing us with some personal information (typically your name, email address and a password).\nThis account information is used to authenticate you when you access Google services and protect your account from unauthorized access by others.\nYou can edit or delete your account at any time through your Google Account settings.\n</p>", "created_at": "2021-03-18 19:58:08.812535", "updated_at": "2021-03-22
