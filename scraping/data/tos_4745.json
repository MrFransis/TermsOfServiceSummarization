several reasons for these prohibitions on free services.\nThe reasons include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:<br> a.\nFirst, free services generally do not require any reliable means of identifying the person who registers for them.\nAs such, it can be practically impossible to track down persons who abuse the free services.<br> b.\nOur customers, including (resellers) are all paying for prompt, reliable service and we have built a solid reputation for delivering excellent service to them.\nWe cannot risk having unidentified persons damage our reputation.<br> c.\nUsers of free services are notorious for registering for free accounts and immediately spamming or otherwise consuming very large amounts of system resources and bandwidth before their accounts are shut down.\nSuch abusers often register for successive or multiple accounts and cause many problems for the servers and network.<br> d.\nSpammers, operators of phishing and pharming scams, distributors of spy ware, viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and other malware, operators of illegal Warez sites, operators of illegal or unauthorized file-swapping or archive sites, and hackers frequently abuse free online services.\nAllowing free services would expose our servers to severe abuse and could harm US/ all of our customers, and all the customers of our resellers.<br> e.\nFree services lead to various forms of abuses that may violate criminal laws or even foster terrorist activities.\nBecause such abuses violate applicable laws as well as our policies, we must prohibit them.<br> If the Customer violates this prohibition on free services, we may suspend their account immediately, with or without notice, as we in our sole discretion deem necessary to address the situation.<br> Additional Information.\nEvolucix reserves the right to request additional identification on any order.\nThe request for additional identification will be sent to the customer before services are established<br>
