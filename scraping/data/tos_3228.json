Security Policy\n<p>Vanguard is committed to protecting your online security.\nWe devote significant resources to the provision of safeguards designed to keep your information and investments secure, so that you can use our website materials and enjoy the benefits of your account with confidence.</p>\n<p>This policy explains some of the many ways in which we keep your details secure and confidential.\nIt informs you about potential threats and other risks which may affect you, and it outlines the additional steps which you can take to protect yourself.</p>\n<p>If you believe that your Vanguard account has been compromised or may be at risk, please email us at personalinvestors@vanguard.co.uk or contact our Personal Investor Services team.</p>\n<p>If you have been a victim of identity theft, you should contact us immediately.\nYou can email or call us at the above email address or phone number.\nplease include your name, the circumstances of the criminal activity, and a phone number where we can reach you.\nAs described further below, identity theft occurs when a criminal steals your personal information to access your accounts or opens new accounts under your name.\nSome common ways in which unauthorised people can get your information include breaking into your house, intercepting your postal mail or email, and sending you phishing emails.</p>\nSecurity features of your Vanguard account\n<p>Vanguard takes very seriously the importance of maintaining your personal information and investments securely at all times.\nWe use a broad range of physical and electronic controls, which we regularly review in order to keep abreast of changing needs and advances in technology.\nSome of our key account security controls are highlighted below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Accessing your account</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>As part of the process of signing up for an online account with Vanguard, you will set up a password and various other security credentials for use when you access your account.\nThis information is encrypted to protect it from third parties, and it will remain confidential and known only by you provided you do not disclose it.\nFor your protection and to ensure security, we always verify your identity before granting you access to your account.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Encryption and preventing unauthorised access</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Vanguard\u2019s website employs some of the strongest currently available encryption technology to protect your online activity with us.\nAll account information passing between your computer and our systems is securely encrypted.</p>\n<p>Our systems are protected by firewalls which block unauthorised entry.\nFirewalls are barriers which permit only certain types of approved traffic to enter our systems.</p>\n<p>Someone acting fraudulently may obtain some of your security details and try to access your account by guessing the rest.\nAs a precaution, we will temporarily disable your account if too many incorrect attempts to log in are made.\nIf you accidentally do this yourself, or if you forget your password, you will be able to reactivate your account by following the online account security re-set procedure available at www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk.\nAlternatively, or if you are unable to reset access your account, please contact our Personal Investor Services team on 0800 587 0460.</p>\n<p>You should always log out of your account when you have finished using the website, to ensure that the secure connection is closed.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Time-out features</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>For added security, Vanguard\u2019s system will automatically log you off after a certain period of inactivity on your account, to reduce the risk of wrongful access by someone else.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Additional security code for account changes</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you wish to make certain changes to the personal information stored in your account (such as your password, home address or bank details), you will be asked first to enter a unique security code.\nThis will be generated and sent to your nominated telephone number, and acts as an additional level of protection against unauthorised dealing with your investments, even if someone has managed to gain access to your account.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Secure online withdrawals</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>To protect you against the risk of fraudulent withdrawals of money from your Vanguard account, we ask you to nominate a single bank account for the purpose of receiving payments from us.\nThis means that, even if someone accesses your account wrongfully, the only bank account to which money can be sent is the one nominated by you.\nIf you wish, you may change your nominated bank account online at any time, but for security you must verify the change before a withdrawal from your account may be authorised subsequently, using an additional security code which we will provide to you as described above for dealings.</p>\n<p>We will also send a message to your phone and email when certain other activities take place on your account.\nPlease contact us immediately if you receive notification of a change or other activity which you did not initiate yourself.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Payment cards</em>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Debit card transactions on Vanguard's website are supported by the Cybersource secure payments gateway.\nCybersource transmit your debit card details to Worldpay, a provider of payment services within the UK which collects the payment from your card issuer.\nThe transmission of debit card data occurs within a secured encrypted network between Cybersource, Worldpay and your card issuer.\nBoth Cybersource and Worldpay are certified under the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS) and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.\nYour debit card details are not received or stored by Vanguard.</p>\nWhat you can do to stay secure\n<p>While Vanguard will do all it reasonably can to keep your account safe, you are urged to take steps yourself to avoid the risks which can arise when transacting online.\nSome practical tips to bear in mind are recommended below.</p>\n<p>You should take steps to use the internet safely and securely at all times.\nFree, expert advice may be obtained at www.getsafeonline.org.\nTo obtain further advice, or to report a fraud, you should contact the UK\u2019s Action Fraud Centre (www.actionfraud.police.uk).</p>\n<p>You should ensure that you have robust, up-to-date firewall, anti-virus and anti-spyware software installed on your PC, as a critical means of protecting your personal information.\nAlso, if you connect to the internet via a wireless network, including a smart phone or tablet, ensure that it is secure.\nRegardless of how good your anti-virus software and other protection may be, information passed to websites on an insecure network can be accessed by someone acting fraudulently.</p>\n<p>It is critical that you keep your account password and other security details secret.\nYou should not disclose them to anyone, and you should be careful not to write them down or store them unsafely.\nIf you do make a record of your password or other log-in details, make sure that these are kept securely, and above all never store your username, full password and transactional password details in the same place.\nRemember, once your account is set up Vanguard will never ask you to divulge your full password.\nIf you are ever asked to provide this, whether on our website or by email or phone, you should stop immediately and contact us on 0800 587 0460 or by email at personalinvestors@vanguard.co.uk.</p>\n<p>We advise against the use of a shared email address if you also register a contact telephone number with Vanguard which is used by another account holder, for instance a family member.\nThis may impact the management of your account or expose it to activity not under your direct control.\nVanguard cannot be held responsible for any unauthorised activity due to use of shared email used with a shared telephone number.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that you change your password regularly, as a means of reducing the risk of harm through someone gaining unauthorised access to your account.\nYou can change your password details at any time by logging in to your account and saving the new password which you choose.</p>\n<p>To keep your account secure generally, you should also not give out any personal or financial information unless you are completely sure that the request for it is legitimate.\nVanguard will never contact you to encourage you to trade on your account, to authorise a transfer of money to a third party, or to request any confidential or account security information from you.\nIf you have any doubt as to whether a personal call is genuine, you should end it and contact our Personal Investor Services team on 0800 587 0460.</p>\n<p>Be very cautious in your treatment of emails, in particular.\nYou should never send us any personal or account information by email, as it is not a secure method of communication.\nWe have provided a secure means whereby you can send us messages via your account when you are logged in (click the \u201ccontact us\u201d link), and information sent in this way is secure.\nAlso, be alert to the risks posed by unsolicited emails which you receive, as these may not be genuine.\nFake or \u201cphishing\u201d emails are designed to appear as if they come from a reputable company, and they attempt to obtain your personal information for criminal purposes (identity theft).\nSuch scam emails can be difficult to tell apart from authentic ones, and if you are in any doubt you should delete them.\nDo not click on any embedded links, which seek to take you to a website, and do not reply to the email.</p>\nThreats and scams\n<p>You should remain vigilant at all times to ensure that you are not caught by one of the many internet-based and other scams attempted by criminals.\nWe have already highlighted some of the main risks, and we list below the most common examples of these threats.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>\u201cPhishing\u201d emails \u2013 </em>\n</b>which claim to be from your bank or another organisation and attempt to trick you into unwittingly providing sensitive personal information by email or by clicking on links to fake websites.\nBe aware that sharing certain personal information through social media may increase the risk of targeted phishing emails.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Advance fee scams (also known as \u201c419 fraud\u201d) \u2013 </em>\n</b>these involve requesting you to make advance payment for services which are not subsequently provided, or promise you a share of the gains from, for example, participating in the transfer of money from another country.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>\u201cBoiler room\u201d scams \u2013 </em>\n</b>these attempt to defraud unsuspecting investors by selling worthless or completely bogus company shares, usually via a telephone cold-calling approach and bogus websites.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<em>Malware</em>\n</b> (malicious software) \u2013 this describes generally various kinds of harmful software installed on your computer by criminals to obtain access to information held there.\nSpecific types of malware include trojans, spyware, and virus.</p>\n<p>In addition to the sources of information already mentioned, visit the UK Police Action Fraud website (http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/) for up to date information about protecting yourself from identity theft, fraud and cyber-crime.\nThere is also useful advice regarding identity fraud and other scams on the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s ScamSmart website (http://scamsmart.fca.org.uk/).</p>\n<p>Specific points to note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Be particularly cautious regarding email correspondence with Vanguard (or other financial institutions with which you have a relationship).\n</b>Email is a particularly vulnerable and commonly used medium for online fraud.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Never provide your login details in full by email or over the phone </b>\u2013 Vanguard will never request these in this way.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Make sure your computer has up-to-date anti-virus software and a firewall installed.\n</b>Consider using anti-spyware software.\nDownload the latest security updates, known as patches, for your browser and for your operating system (e.g.\nWindows).</li>\n<li>\n<b>Be wary of unsolicited emails requesting personal financial information.\n&nbsp;</b>You are responsible for keeping your login credentials safe.\nalways be wary of unsolicited emails or calls asking you to disclose any personal details or card numbers.\nVanguard, your bank, building society or the police would never contact you to ask
