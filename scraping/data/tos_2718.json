you do choose to use the Services, you must agree to the Medscape Network Terms of Use which is a contract between us and users of the Services.\nBy agreeing to the Medscape Network Terms of Use, you confirm that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy which explains how we collect, disclose, transfer, secure and use information about you in connection with your use of the Services and the rights and choices you have regarding these activities.\nIf you do not want us to collect and use information about you as described in this Privacy Policy, then you should not use the Services.\nBy using the Services, you acknowledge that we will store, use and otherwise process your information in the United States and any other country from where the applicable Medscape Network

Tracking</b>.\nWe and our service providers collect and store information about users' interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies.\nThis allows us to infer the presence of a common user or household behind multiple devices.\nWe do so in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>provide personalized advertising on each device that is inferred from the browsing patterns on all of the devices;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>detect and prevent fraud;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>allow users to use our service on one device and pick up seamlessly where they left off on another device;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>limiting the number of times a user is shown the same advertisement, across known or inferred devices</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information on your advertising choices and opt-out, please see the \u201cChoices and Control\u201d section of this Privacy Notice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Market Research</b>.\nYou may be invited

that commissioned the survey.\nFor some surveys, you may be asked to provide personal information for re-contact (e.g., by e-mail or phone) or payment fulfillment purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Public Forums</b>.\nWhen you post a comment on a discussion board or other public forum, by default your username, specialty and degree will be displayed within the

Registration Forms</b>.\nFrom time to time we may offer you the opportunity to receive additional information or services from us or from third parties, including our advertisers (e.g., sample request, sales rep visit, direct marketing, etc.), or to register to attend live events, either in-person or via livestream.\nIf you wish to participate in such opportunities, you may be asked to provide personal information to fulfill the request.\nUnless otherwise specified in the request form, we may use such information as described in this Privacy Policy and the third party, if applicable, will be required to use such personal information as described at the point of collection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Information from Third Party Sources</b>.\nWe may obtain additional information about you from third party sources to assist us in providing the Services.\nFor example, we may use third party information to verify and augment your registration information, for research purposes or to personalize the Services, including advertising.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Non-registered Users</b>.\nYou must register with the Medscape Network to gain full access to Services, however, you may be able to access certain limited Services without registering.\nEven if you have not registered, we collect information about your use of the Services through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.\nThe information we collect includes the referring website, if applicable, the type of browser you use, the material viewed, and the time and date that you accessed the Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> How Your Information May be Used\n<p>Information about you may be used for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Provision of the Services</b>.\nWe may use the information collected about you to provide and improve the Services, and to develop new Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Member Profiles</b>.\nWe may associate information that we have collected about your use of the Services with your registration information and any other information we have about you, as described in this Privacy Policy, thereby creating a profile of you that we may update from time to time (\"Member Profile\").\nThis processing of your Member Profile is necessary to deliver the Services tailored according to your specialty and interests (known or inferred), as further described below in Personalize the Services Including Advertising.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Network Profiles</b>.\nWe may use your registration information, as well as information from third-party sources such as IQVIA, to create a profile for you that is viewable by other members of the Medscape Network, which may be associated with content with which you engage and comments you may post (collectively, your \"Network Profile\").</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Communications</b>.\nBy registering as a member of the Medscape Network, you agree to the use of your registration information and other information collected about you as described in this Privacy Policy to communicate with you about the Services and other information that may be of interest to you.\nThese communications may be conveyed through a variety of channels, subject to applicable law, including emails and may contain advertisements and other promotional materials from third party sponsors, including pharmaceutical companies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Personalize the Services Including Advertising</b>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may personalize the Services, including the advertising you see within the Medscape Network, on third party websites and in our email communications, based on information included in your Member Profile.\nFor example, a user who WebMD believes is a cardiologist or who has browsed cardiology content with the Medscape Network may be served an advertisement promoting a particular cardiac product within the Medscape Network, on third party websites and/or within an email that a user who WebMD believes is a neurologist or has not browsed cardiology content will not see.\nWe partner with third parties to manage and conduct our advertising activities including advertising on our websites and on third party websites.\nThese third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to deliver this advertising based on your activities and interests as inferred from your use of the Services and other information they have about you.\nAlso, advertisers may use their own cookies and other tracking technologies in the advertisements served to you through the Services, some of which may enable the advertiser to obtain personal information that can be used to specifically identify you, including the fact that you saw the advertisement, to the extent that you have separately provided consent to the advertiser or to the third party providing the tracking technology.\nSome advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their advertisements on their behalf and to monitor users' responses to these advertisements through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.\nWhile WebMD generally permits the use of third party tracking technologies based on an understanding that they comply with the WebMD Advertising Policy, we do not have control over these third parties' use of cookies and other tracking technologies or how they manage the information they gather through them and WebMD may be unable to verify compliance with the WebMD Advertising Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Personalization is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us according to which we deliver the Services.\nWe analyze or deduct your preferences and interests based on a number of factors including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>your profile (information provided at the registration time), enriched with other information obtained from third-party sources such as IQVIA to ensure accuracy of our data and comply with our legal obligations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your interactions with our Services and the Medscape Network, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>your viewing and search history,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the time and location of Your access to our Services,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the device you use,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>answers you give to surveys and quiz,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>our content you post, like, share or recommend, including through social media.\nOther users with similar tastes and preferences on our Service;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>your interactions with other websites including with the Medscape Network, subject to our Cookies Policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This information is used to classify users into different groups or segments, using algorithms and machine-learning.\nThis analysis helps identify links and patterns between different behaviors and characteristics to recommend relevant Services for you.\nThis will never prevent you from accessing and browsing the Services available to you within the Medscape Network.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Verification Purposes</b>.\nWe may use your information in conjunction with information from third parties to recognize you as a registered member when you visit one of our properties and to verify your identity and/or professional credentials.\nWe may require you to provide proof of your identity, including that you are a healthcare professional, and if you are unable to do so to our reasonable satisfaction, we reserve the right to deny you access to the Services.\nWhile we take steps to verify that our members who identify as healthcare professionals are actually healthcare professionals, we make no guarantee as to their identity, professional credentials or licensure status.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Account Management</b>.\nWe may use your information to administer your account, respond to your inquiries, fulfill your requests and send you administrative communications about the Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Investigations</b>.\nWe may use your information to detect, investigate and defend against fraudulent or unlawful activity, violations of the Medscape Terms of Use and to otherwise establish, exercise and defend our legal rights.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Sharing Your Information with Third Parties <p>Information about your use of the Services may be shared as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Service Providers</b>.\nWe work with third party service providers to help us provide the Services and to otherwise assist us in the operation of the Medscape Network, including in the areas of email management and deployment, analytics, marketing, advertising, market research, sweepstakes and contest administration, identity and professional credential validation, content distribution, customer service, payment fulfillment, event logistics, website maintenance and data storage and security.\nWe may provide these service providers with personal information about users of our Services so that they can fulfill their responsibilities to us, however, we do require that they agree to limit their use of this personal information to the fulfillment of these responsibilities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Advertising and Sponsored Programs</b>.\nWe may provide your personal information to third party sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs, subject to applicable law.\nSpecifically, when you are exposed to an advertisement through the Services, whether on one of our websites or apps, in an email or through some other means, or when you engage in a Sponsored Program, e.g., access a sponsored information resource, open one of our sponsored emails, WebMD may provide your personal information, such as your name and specialty (but not your email or postal address) to the applicable sponsor and/or its agents on the sponsor's behalf.\nWe may also provide such third parties with details about your engagement with the advertisement or Sponsored Program (e.g., whether you viewed or otherwise interacted with certain content), your answers to any questions contained in the Sponsored Program and information about you that we have received from third parties.\nAdditionally, when you register as a member of the Medscape Network, we may provide your personal information (but not your email or postal address) to potential sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs that may be offered or provided to you through the Services, subject to applicable law.\nPlease review the Privacy Policies of these third parties to familiarize yourself with their practices.\nAll advertisements and Sponsored Programs (including any links to Sponsored Programs) made available within the Medscape Network, including through emails, will be identified to you by the label Advertisement, Information from Industry, Sponsored, WebMD Professional or some similar designation indicating that the content, which may pertain to a particular medical condition, therapy, product or service, has been selected by a third-party sponsor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Member Profiles</b>.\nSubject to applicable law, WebMD may provide Member Profiles, and portions thereof, (excluding contact information and information about your participation in specific named CME and CE activities) to third parties, including our advertising customers, which these third parties may use for their business purposes including marketing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Network Profiles</b>.\nYour Network Profile may be viewable by other members of the Medscape Network for personalization purposes described above and to allow you to view and connect with other members of the Medscape Network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Market Research</b>.\nIf you receive remuneration for participating in a market research program offered through our Services, we may provide your personal information to our payment fulfillment vendor so that it can process and deliver your payment to you and for its recordkeeping and regulatory compliance purposes, and also to the program sponsor (or the market research company acting on its behalf) for its recordkeeping and regulatory compliance purposes.\nIf you choose to access a survey that is conducted by a third party market research company, we may identify you to this company.\nSometimes market research companies send us lists of individuals they wish to reach with particular market research opportunities and we may inform these companies which of these individuals are members of the Medscape Network so that they can manage their recruitment needs accordingly.\nAlso, certain market research opportunities require us or the market research company to contact you directly to conduct the survey, including by telephone.\nWe will inform you in the research invitation if you will be required to provide additional contact information, e.g., phone number, to participate so that you can decide at that time if you wish to proceed with the opportunity.\nWe do not disclose your survey responses to the sponsor in a manner that identifies you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Continuing Medical Education</b>.\nMedscape, LLC (\u201cMedscape\u201d) is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, the American Nurses Credentialing Center and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education to deliver continuing education for the healthcare team (collectively, \"CME/CE\"), which CME/CE activities are hosted by Medscape on Medscape Education (medscape.org), which is part of the Medscape Network.\nAs an accredited entity, Medscape is required to periodically submit personal information about CME/CE participation to the relevant accrediting entities.\nMedscape and its affiliates that develop independent medical education content (\u201cIME\u201d), including WebMD Global LLC (\"WebMD Global\"), may provide your personal information to accredited providers that certify CME/CE and IME offered through the Services as required to process your credits, fulfill their reporting obligations to the relevant accreditation bodies, and for their internal recordkeeping and regulatory purposes.\nCommercial supporters of CME/CE and IME activities receive only aggregated data about the activities that they support including participation and outcomes measurement reports.\nWe may share your personal information among our affiliates for the purpose of sending you a survey with respect to a CME/CE or IME activity.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Logging in to Another Website Using Your Medscape Credentials</b>.\nCertain third party websites permit you to log in using

registration profile including personal information such as your name, specialty, occupation and email address, (but not your Medscape username and password), which the operator of the website has agreed to use in accordance with its website's privacy policy.\nYou should review the third party website's privacy policy before logging in.\nIf the privacy policy of the third party site permits, we may receive information about your use of this third party site, which we may use in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Adverse Event Reporting</b>.\nIf you provide us information about an adverse event regarding a pharmaceutical product or medical device, we may be required to report such information along with your contact information to the manufacturer as required for it to fulfill its reporting obligations to the applicable regulatory authority.\nIf you do not want this information reported to the applicable manufacturer and regulatory authority, then do not provide us with adverse event information.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Consent</b>.\nWe may disclose your personal information to a third party in a manner not addressed by this Privacy Policy subject to your consent at such time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Aggregated Information</b>.\nWe may provide aggregated information about users of our Services to third parties as we deem appropriate

social widgets within our websites and apps which enable you to interact with the associated social media services, e.g., to share an article.\nThese widgets may collect browsing data which may be

platform.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Business Transfers and Affiliates</b>.\nWe may share your information with any member of our group of companies (meaning our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries) for their use for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, including to market to you through a variety of channels as described herein, subject to applicable law.\nIn connection with a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, we reserve the right to transfer your personal information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets.\nIn the event of such a change, your personal information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as may be modified as described below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Legal Requirements</b>.\nWe may release personal information when we believe release (i) is required to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order and to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\nor (ii) is reasonable in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights of us or others.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nSecurity of Information\n<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect the personal information that we have under our control from unauthorized access, use, disclosure and accidental loss.\nWhen you enter personal information, we encrypt the transmission of that information or use SSL connections (Secure Socket Layer) technology.\nYou are solely responsible for maintaining the security and
