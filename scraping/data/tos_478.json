INVESTMENTS services (<b>\"Services\"</b>) which includes the Web site located at pho.to the \"Site\") and all LINEROCK INVESTMENTS mobile phone applications (<b>\"Mobile\"</b>).</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.\nBY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH BELOW, YOU MAY NOT USE THE LINEROCK INVESTMENTS SERVICES.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy together with our Terms of Service applies to information (including personal information) collected during your use of LINEROCK INVESTMENTS services.\nFor the purpose of this Privacy Policy, \"personal information\" means information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us.\nPersonal information does not include technical, device, or usage information that cannot be used to identify you personally, nor does it include \"aggregate\" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Services or about a group or category of Services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information have been removed.\nThis Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate and non-personal information, and we may share such data about our users with third parties for various purposes.</p> What Information We <br>Collect<p>We respect the privacy of every individual who uses our Services.\nWe collect certain personal information that you voluntarily provide to us.\nFor example, we collect your name, email address, user name, social network information and other information you provide us when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our services.\nWe may also obtain information from other companies and combine that with the information we collect on the Services.\nfor example, when you link your account with Facebook, we might have access to your name and profile picture.</p>\n<p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect some information.\nSuch information includes the type of browser you use, your browser\u2019s language, access time or the website from which you linked to us.\nWe also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity

collect information about others if you use our Services to upload, share and/or distribute Content that contains information about them, including their name, image and online contact information.</p> SERVICE DATA<p>To use our Services, you should provide a photo prior to the event of photo editing.\nSince the processing requires Internet connection and is performed on our servers the photos are sent there through the encrypted connection.\nWe use Secure Socket Layer technology to protect the privacy and integrity of the transmission process.</p>\n<p>For non-registered users and users who don\u2019t share their results within the Services, the original photos and results are automatically removed from our servers by two weeks after the last interaction.\nFor registered users who share their results within the Services that provide special social network features, the shared content will be stored on the servers and shown within the Services unless a user either removes the images themselves or requests such a removal by contacting our support team.</p>\n<p>Whenever you choose an effect that involves face manipulations we use special face recognition technologies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>detect a face in a photo;</li>\n<li>find required facial key points (the set of points varies with the effect);</li>\n<li>and apply the effect to your photo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The detected key points may be kept along with the photo on the servers of our providers for up to two weeks from the last interaction with the photo.\nThe only purpose of this is to speed up any further processings of the same photos.</p>Cookies<p>We automatically collect certain information through the use of \"cookies\".\nCookies are small data files that are stored locally.\nWe use cookies to collect information about your device, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report information to our branded partners.</p>\n<p>We may store some information locally when you visit the Site or use Services.\nThis information facilitates your use of the site or Sevices, personalizes your experience, and helps us to remember your preferences.\nThe information stored in a cookie provides features that recognize your account as logged on and other Site or Serveces features.\nWe do not have any control over cookies which our advertisers or branded partners may use.</p>Security<p>The technology that we use and the policies that we have implemented are intended to safeguard your privacy from unauthorized access and improper use.\nWe will continue to update these measures as new technology becomes available.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures.\nIf you use a password on our Services, you are responsible for keeping it confidential.\nDo not share it with any other person.\nIf you believe your
