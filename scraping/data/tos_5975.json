Aktiengesellschaft), its video-player widgets and other products is possible without any indication of personal data.\nhowever, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, video-player widgets or any of our other products, processing of personal data could become necessary.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>\n<p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft).\nBy means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.\nFurthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.</p>\n<p>As the controller, ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.\nHowever, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.\nFor this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g.\nby telephone.</p> 01 Definitions <p>The data protection declaration of ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nOur data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners.\nTo ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.\nIn this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>\n<strong>A</strong> Personal data</dt>\n<dd>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d).\nAn identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,

Restriction of processing</dt>\n<dd>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>E</strong> Profiling</dt>\n<dd>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>F</strong> Pseudonymisation</dt>\n<dd>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>G</strong> Controller or controller responsible for the processing</dt>\n<dd>Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\nwhere the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>H</strong> Processor</dt>\n<dd>Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>I</strong> Recipient</dt>\n<dd>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed,

processing.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>J</strong> Third party</dt>\n<dd>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>K</strong> Consent</dt>\n<dd>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</dd>\n</dl> 02 Name and Address of the controller <p>Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is:</p>\nShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft)\n<p>Brunnenstr.\n154</p>\n<p>10115 Berlin</p>\n<p>Deutschland</p>\n<p>Phone: +4915114534007</p>\n<p>Email: gdpr@showheroes.com</p>\n<p>Website: www.showheroes.com</p> 03 Cookies <p>The Internet pages of ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) use cookies.\nCookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.</p>\n<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies.\nMany cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.\nA cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\nIt consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.\nThis allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.\nA specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>\n<p>Through the use of cookies, ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>\n<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.\nCookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.\nThe purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.\nThe website user that uses cookies, e.g.\ndoes not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user\u2019s computer system.\nAnother example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.\nThe online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>\n<p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nFurthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.\nThis is possible in all popular Internet browsers.\nIf the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p> 04 Collection of general data and information <p>The website of ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.\nThis general data and information are stored in the server log files.\nCollected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>\n<p>When using these general data and information, ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p> 05 Registration on our website <p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data.\nWhich personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration.\nThe personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes.\nThe controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g.\na parcel service) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.</p>\n<p>By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address\u2014assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject\u2014date, and time of the registration are also stored.\nThe storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.\nInsofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller.\nThis data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.\nRegistered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>\n<p>The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject.\nIn addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.\nThe entirety of the controller\u2019s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.</p> 06 Subscription to our newsletters <p>On the website of ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft), users are given the opportunity to subscribe to our enterprise\u2019s newsletter.\nThe input mask used for this purpose determines what personal data are transmitted, as well as when the newsletter is ordered from the controller.</p>\n<p>ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) informs its customers and business partners regularly by means of a newsletter about enterprise offers.\nThe enterprise\u2019s newsletter may only be received by the data subject if (1) the data subject has a valid e-mail address and (2) the data subject registers for the newsletter shipping.\nA confirmation e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address registered by a data subject for the first time for newsletter shipping, for legal reasons, in the double opt-in procedure.\nThis confirmation e-mail is used to prove whether the owner of the e-mail address as the data subject is authorized to receive the newsletter.</p>\n<p>During the registration for the newsletter, we also store the IP address of the computer system assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject at the time of the registration, as well as the date and time of the registration.\nThe collection of this data is necessary in order to understand the (possible) misuse of the e-mail address of a data subject at a later date, and it therefore serves the aim of the legal protection of the controller.</p>\n<p>The personal data collected as part of a registration for the newsletter will only be used to send our newsletter.\nIn addition, subscribers to the newsletter may be informed by e-mail, as long as this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service or a registration in question, as this could be the case in the event of modifications to the newsletter offer, or in the event of a change in technical circumstances.\nThere will be no transfer of personal data collected by the newsletter service to third parties.\nThe subscription to our newsletter may be terminated by the data subject at any time.\nThe consent to the storage of personal data, which the data subject has given for shipping the newsletter, may be revoked at any time.\nFor the purpose of revocation of consent, a corresponding link is found in each newsletter.\nIt is also possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller, or to communicate this to the controller in a different way.</p> 07 Newsletter-Tracking <p>The newsletter of ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) contains so-called tracking pixels.\nA tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in such e-mails, which are sent in HTML format to enable log file recording and analysis.\nThis allows a statistical analysis of the success or failure of online marketing campaigns.\nBased on the embedded tracking pixel, ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) may see if and when an e-mail was opened by a data subject, and which links in the e-mail were called up by data subjects.</p>\n<p>Such personal data collected in the tracking pixels contained in the newsletters are stored and analyzed by the controller in order to optimize the shipping of the newsletter, as well as to adapt the content of future newsletters even better to the interests of the data subject.\nThese personal data will not be passed on to third parties.\nData subjects are at any time entitled to revoke the respective separate declaration of consent issued by means of the double-opt-in procedure.\nAfter a revocation, these personal data will be deleted by the controller.\nShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) automatically regards a withdrawal from the receipt of the newsletter as a revocation.</p> 08 Contact possibility via the website <p>The website of ShowHeroes SE (Europ\u00e4ische Aktiengesellschaft) contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called electronic mail (e-mail address).</p>\n<p>If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored.\nSuch personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.\nThere is no transfer of this personal data to third parties.</p> 09 Routine erasure and blocking of personal data <p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>\n<p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p> 10 Rights of the data subject <dl>\n<dt>\n<strong>A</strong> Right of confirmation</dt>\n<dd>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>B</strong> Right of access</dt>\n<dd>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information.\nFurthermore,

about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.\nWhere this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p>\n<p>If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>\n<strong>C</strong> Right to rectification</dt>\n<dd>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her.\nTaking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data

grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:\n<ul>\n<li>The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.</li>\n<li>The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.</li>\n<li>The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.</li>\n<li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</li>\n<li>The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.</li>\n<li>The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society

<p>Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIs our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\nSuch processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nHe considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>\n<p>Further informatiton can be found here.</p> 23 The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\n24 Period for which the personal data will be stored The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.\nAfter expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.\n25 Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.\nRequirement necessary to enter into a contract.\nObligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n26 Existence of automated decision-making
