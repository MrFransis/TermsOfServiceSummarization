which provides all advocacy services on www.thehotline.org and through 24-hour telephone services at 1-800-799-7233.</p>\n<p>Anonymous Digital Service is defined as a one-time confidential contact between a user and advocate in which no identifying information is verified.</p>\n<p>\n<b>The Hotline Provides Digital Services</b>\n</p>\n<p>Engaging in our digital services constitutes an agreement and understanding of privacy policy.\nDigital services are defined as web based chat, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, The Hotline blog or any Hotline website or web-based comment section.\nIf at any time, a digital service user feels that their safety or privacy may be compromised due their use of these services, the interaction can be escalated to phone-based services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Opt-Out Policy</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Hotline gives users options for non-digital services when necessary and practical.\nSuch choices include opting not to engage in digital services and opting not to provide identifiable information during interactions with advocates.\nUsers concerned for their physical safety and well-being are encouraged to contact The Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Confidential and Anonymous Chat</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our live chat services are provided by Caspio as a service (SaaS) provider.\nChat users are asked to enter their name and other personal information to facilitate service with an operator.\nIP addresses are also required to facilitate a connection.\nInformation collected from a user on a voluntary basis can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organization name</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>City</li>\n<li>State</li>\n<li>Zip</li>\n<li>How user-heard about the service</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The National Domestic Violence Hotline collects limited demographic and geo-locational information in order to provide services.\nThe National Domestic Violence Hotline defines anonymous communication as a onetime individual contact where digital services are provided between a chatter and advocate in which no information is collected that can connect the user to the individual service interaction.\nDialogue transcripts of chats are purged regularly.\nAny information that is temporarily maintained is core to our evaluation of services provided to persons contacting the National Domestic Violence Hotline.\nIdentifying information is in no way cross-verified.\nA chat user\u2019s information, including any personally identifiable information, will only be shared with persons implicitly linked to The Hotline\u2019s operations.\nWe do not sell, trade or rent personal information that chat users provide.\nAll advocates, including volunteers, are required to sign a client confidentiality policy.\nAfter any chat or email session, persons contacting The Hotline may be asked to fill out an exit survey in order to provide valuable feedback about our service.\nProviding information in an exit survey is completely voluntary.\nSurveys may ask for contact information (e.g., email address) and for demographic information (e.g., zip code, age or income level).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Text/SMS Messaging Services</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Hotline offers services through a text message short code in which all inbound phone-numbers are scrambled.\nThese services include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Text-for-help services: The same privacy standards applied to our chat services apply to our text-for-help platform.\nAny statement of charges or billing will appear as a text message sent to Waterfall, based in Austin, and is in no way connected to The Hotline.\nUsers may be asked to provide voluntary feedback to survey questions.</li>\n<li>Opt-in newsletter/updates: Users can opt-in to receive regular messages providing updates relevant issue-related content.\nUsers can opt-out any time.\nWhile numbers may be&nbsp.\nscrambled, but users may provide voluntary feedback to survey questions.</li>\n<li>One-time information messages: These are one-time messages are sent to a user to inform the user of specific issue content.\nThe user has the option to learn more on follow-up page.\nNo further communication will occur unless prompted by the user.\nThe Hotline will not provide crisis services in this type of interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users can opt-out of services by texting \u2018STOP\u2019 to our shortcode any time.\nUsers can get help by texting \u2018HELP\u2019 to our shortcode any time.\nMessage and data rates may apply.\nUsers will be charged standard text messaging rates relative to their provider\u2019s plans.\nCarriers are not liable for the delayed or undelivered messages.\nMessage frequency may vary.\nUsers should be aware and mindful that text messages sent using modern smart phones are saved indefinitely and could compromise their safety.\nUsers concerned for their physical safety and well-being are encouraged to contact The Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Software as a Service and Application Service Providers (3rd party)</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Hotline will undertake an annual review of any third party privacy policies affecting
