process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given your consent for one or more specific purposes.\nNote that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below.\nThis, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law.\n(ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.\n(iii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject.\n(iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us.\n(v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.\nIn any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.\n<br>\n<br>\nInformation transfer and storage\nDepending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your

obligations thereof.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe right to object to processing\nWhere Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.\nYou must know that, however,
