Damaged Items <br> Listia is not responsible for any item that is shipped by a member and is lost or damaged in the shipping process.\nItems lost or damaged in transit are the sole responsibility of the shipping member.\nIn the event that there is a dispute between members regarding the shipment or condition of an item, Listia will attempt to mediate the dispute and may, in its sole discretion,

Listia.\n<br>\n<br> When you receive a Credit, Listia hereby grants you a limited license (\"Credit License\") to use the Credit as a virtual token to be held, bartered, traded and/or transferred on the Service with other users (and/or Listia), in exchange for permission to access and use content, applications, services, and various user-listed items, in accordance with these Terms of Service.\nThe Credit License is transferable by the holder to any other user, provided that both users comply with these Terms of Service and maintain their Accounts in good standing.\nExcept as expressly permitted by this Agreement or otherwise expressly permitted by Listia, the Credit License may not be sublicensed, encumbered, conveyed or made subject to any right of survivorship or other disposition by operation of law or otherwise, and you agree that any attempted disposition in violation of these Terms of Service is null and void.\nListia may revoke the Credit License at any time without notice, refund or compensation in the event that: (i) the Credit program is suspended or terminated.\n(ii) Listia determines that the Account holder has committed fraud or other illegal conduct.\n(iii) Listia imposes an expiration date on usage of Credits in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n(iv) the holder's Account is terminated for violation of these Terms of

instrument and are not redeemable for any sum of money from Listia at any time.\nYou agree that Listia has the right to manage, regulate, control, and/or modify the license rights underlying such Credits as it sees fit and that Listia will have no liability to you based on its exercise of this right.\nListia makes no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of the features of the Service that will be accessible through the use of Credits, or the availability or supply of Credits.\nListia may modify, revalue, or make the Credits and Services more or less common, valuable, effective, or functional.\n<br>\n<br> When you win a listing, your winning bid amount in Credits will be subtracted from your Account.\nWhen another user wins your listing, you get the winning bid amount in Credits added to your Account, less any stated transaction fees.\nCredits may also be purchased for a fee from Listia.\nCredits may be held by Listia in a pending state or in escrow while both parties confirm that the items in the listing have been delivered and received.\n<br>\n<br> You acknowledge that except as set forth in this Agreement, purchases of Credits or other goods, content and features of the Service are final, non-refundable, have no monetary value (i.e.\nare not a cash account or equivalent) and are purchases of only a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable license to use, even if they come with a durational term (e.g.\na monthly subscription).\nNotwithstanding any agreement by Listia to provide a discretionary pro-rata refund or credit in certain circumstances, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, economic, or monetary interest in your Account, Credits, content or subscriptions, which remain the exclusive property of Listia.\n<br>\n<br> Dormant Accounts <br> An Account may be deemed \"dormant\" when no items have been listed or bids placed within any 1 year period.\nDormant Accounts may be closed and any accumulated Credits forfeited without compensation to the Account holder.\n</li>\n<li> 7.\nPROPS.\n<br> 7.1.\nAccess.\nIn order to receive any benefits on the Service from holding cryptographic tokens issued by Listia (\"Props\"), you must (a) complete the Approval Process described in 7.4 below, (b) link a digital wallet (such as MyEtherWallet, Metamask, or Mobile Wallet) (a \"Wallet\") to your Account by following the instructions we provide to you in the Service and (c) associate a certain Props balance (such balance may change from time to time) with the Wallet that you linked to your Account.\nProps may be associated with the Wallet that you linked to your Account either (i) upon receiving Props into that Wallet from an external source such that the Props were transferred to your Wallet by third parties or (ii) upon earning Props by taking certain actions as described below under \"Earning Props\" such that we send Props to the Wallet you associated with your Account.\nIf You connect a Wallet with your Account, you provide Listia with the public address of your Wallet and authorize us to use that public address in connection with our provision of the Service, including to read the balance of Props therein, display the balance of Props in such Wallet to you through the Service or display to other users of the Service that you hold Props, and to send all Props you earn in connection with the Service to that Wallet.\nListia will send Props you may receive as rewards under these Terms only to this Wallet.\nYou acknowledge that any balance of Props displayed does not refer to any credit balance of real currency, Credits, virtual currency, or its equivalent.\nBy linking a Wallet to your Account, You represent and warrant that you are the exclusive owner and controller of such Wallet and the contents of the Wallet, including all Props associated with that Wallet and all Props that we send to that Wallet, and have all necessary permissions to authorize us to access such Wallet as contemplated by us, the Service, and these Terms.\nYou cannot sell, purchase, exchange, or grant Props through the Service.\nFurther, by agreeing to the Terms, You agree to not transfer your Account to anyone else.\n<br>\n<br> 7.2.\nRewarding Activities.\nWe may reward certain activities that you may perform while using the Service, which may include without limitation: (1) selling an item successfully with positive feedback, (2) buying an item and giving the seller a feedback rating, (3) earning badges, which generally includes engaging with the Service in defined and meaningful ways, (4) completing goals that are set and determined by Listia, and (5) certain one-time events, such as competitions and bonuses.\nThe specific amount of any rewards to you after performing any of these activities will be determined in Listia's sole discretion.\nIn addition, Listia may in its sole discretion adjust the circumstances and types of activities that are rewarded in the app.\nThe specific amount of rewards is determined by a formula that Listia may modify at any time in its sole discretion.\nYou understand and agree that the amount of any rewards depends, in part, on the volume, audience, and nature of items listed, bought, and sold by other users on the same calendar period and, thus, the same activities may not have the same rewards on different calendar periods.\nFurther, you agree that you are not entitled to earn or receive any rewards of any kind in connection with your activity on the Service or your listings and content or use of the Service in any of the following circumstances: (a) you are not at least 18 years of age or older (b) if one or more third parties claim rights to certain elements of your content or listings.\n(c) if the ability to receive rewards is disabled on your Account by either you or Listia.\nor (d) Your Listia Account is suspended, banned, erased, or terminated.\nThe Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you if any of these circumstances should occur.\n<br>\n<br> 7.3.\nPending Props.\nIf you perform an activity that we determine to reward, the performance of this activity alone does not entitle you to receive Props.\nIf you perform one of these actions, we may indicate that you are provisionally entitled to receive Props by associating \"Pending Props\" with your Listia Account.\nPending Props are not Props or other cryptocurrencies and are only accounting mechanisms used by Listia to signify who is provisionally entitled to receive Props Tokens because they have completed certain in-app activities.\nPending Props are not transferrable, and you may not transfer any Pending Props associated with Your Listia Account.\nIf we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have violated these Terms, in our sole discretion, we may cause you to forfeit all of the Pending Props associated with your Listia Account.\n<br>\n<br> 7.4.\nReceiving Props.\nIn order to receive Props, You must comply with these Terms.\nPending Props may only become Props when (i) you have verified your identity with us through a KYC verification process and gone through an AML check, each as described below, (ii) you have supplied all tax forms requested by us and completed any other documentation requested by us in our sole discretion, (iii) you have linked a Wallet to your Listia Account by following the instructions we provide to you, (iv) we have completed all fraud checks or other checks we deem necessary to confirm that rewards are validly issued pursuant to these Terms, and (v) Listia determines, in its sole discretion, that you are eligible to receive Props (collectively, (i) through (v) are the \" Approval Process\").\nIn connection with the operation of the Service, Listia collects information from users that Listia deems necessary to collect in order to complete know-your-client (KYC) verification and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.\nWe may require that you provide all information that we, in our sole discretion, deem necessary in order to allow us to complete these checks.\nIn addition, we may require that you have a minimum number of Pending Props, which number Listia can adjust from time to time, before you can complete these required KYC and AML verifications.\nAs a result, You must have a minimum level of Pending Props to any Props in connection with your use of the Service.\n<br>\n<br> 7.5.\nIf You fail to provide all information and documentation requested by us in connection with the Approval Process within 120 days following the date that we associated a Pending Prop with your user account, or if Listia determines, in its sole discretion, that you are not eligible to receive Props, we may cancel the Pending Props, and you will not be entitled to receive any Props in connection with any such Pending Props.\n<br>\n<br> 7.6.\nTransfer of Props.\nIf Listia determines you are eligible to receive Props, we may reward Your activities with Props in an amount equal to the number of Pending Props for which all of the above-described steps have completed.\nIn order to complete a reward of Props, Listia will initiate a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain that will cause the requisite number of Props to be associated with your Wallet.\nIn order to minimize costs associated with effecting transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, Listia may effect these transactions on a weekly, monthly, or less frequent, basis and any issuance to you will occur only in connection with the next-occurring issuance or, if the award cannot be made at the next-occurring issuance in a commercially reasonable manner, then the award will be effected as soon as reasonably practicable.\nUpon the initiation of this transaction, the corresponding Pending Props will be cancelled in your Account.\n<br>\n<br> 7.7.\nProps Functionality / Props Benefits.\nProps may provide users with premium functionality within the Service.\nThese functionalities may include, without limitation: (1) Level Status: the more Props a user has, the higher their status level display associated with that user within the service is.\nand (2) Bonuses and discounts: users on Listia who have a certain balance of Props may receive discounts and bonuses for activities such as purchasing Credits, completing offers for Credits, or reduced transaction fees for selling items in the marketplace.\nThese benefits may vary based on the level of Props holdings that a user has.\nFor example, users with more Props will be afforded higher \"Level Status\" within the app and may receive higher discounts and bonuses..\nFor purposes of making the calculation of how many Props you have, Listia may count Pending Props together with Props for these benefits.\nAs a result, for example, in order to determine your \"Level Status\" in the app, we count both Props and Pending Props.\n<br>\n<br> 7.8.\nWe may in our sole discretion modify these functions for your Props.\nFor example, we may adjust how \"Level Status\" is displayed, the varying levels of statuses, what benefits are afforded to these statuses, when discounts and bonuses are given to users, and the specific amount of the discounts and bonuses afforded to any users.\nWe may add to or remove these basic functionalities for Props in the app in the future.\nFor purposes of all functionalities in the future, we may in our sole discretion determine to count or not count Pending Props together with Props when making the calculation of how many Props You have.\nPending Props will not necessarily always entitle you to the same functionality that Props entitle you to in the app.\n<br>\n<br> 7.9.\nNotwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, if You violate these Terms, we reserve the right in our sole discretion to remove you from the Service and deny Y=you the benefits of these functions in their entirety.\nAs a result, if you violate these Terms, you may not ever enjoy the benefits we afford to other users who hold Props and have Pending Props associated with their user account.\nIn addition, if Listia discontinues or ceases providing the Service, or substantially reduces the functionality of the Service, for any reason, then you may not be able to continue enjoying the benefits associated with Props.\n<br>\n<br> 7.10.\nListia may terminate your eligibility to receive rewards in connection with your activity or your listings and content or the Service for any reason without prior notice to you.\nIf You decide to terminate your Listia Account or participation in this rewards program, Listia may NOT be able to complete any pending rewards to you, and for the avoidance of doubt, you will have no right to receive any rewards and your Pending Props may be cancelled.\nAdditionally, Listia may suspend or terminate your Listia Account, or otherwise terminate Your participation in the rewards program or in connection with the Service, immediately and without notice if Listia determines or suspects, in its sole discretion, that you have violated the Terms or any other agreement between you and, on the other hand, Listia or any of its affiliates.\nUpon termination of your Listia Account or your participation in the rewards program, all other rights and duties of the parties toward each other shall cease.\n<br>\n<br> 7.11.\nNo Employment.\nYou are engaging Listia for the use of the Service and ability to potentially receive Props.\nYou are not an employee of Listia or any affiliated entity.\nIn the event that any court or agency determines that you performed services for Listia or any affiliated entity, you agree that it is the express intention of Listia and you that your participation through the Service is as an independent contractor to Listia.\nNothing in these Terms shall in any way be construed to constitute you acting as an agent, employee or representative of Listia.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you are obligated to report as income all compensation received in connection with your use of the Service.\nYou agree to and acknowledge the obligation to pay all self-employment and other taxes on such income.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that you are not required to create litsings, make or share content, nor do you have any schedule or requirements related thereto except as provided herein.\n<br>\n<br> 7.12.\nNo Advice.\nListia is not providing any advice relating to the Props or the advisability of using the Service for the purpose of receiving any Props, and you agree that you have received and have had an opportunity to review the Props Offering Circular and all the information, including risk factors, described therein.\nYou agree that you are using the Service without being furnished any offering literature other than the Props Offering Circular, and that you are making your decision to participate and use the Service, including for purposes of obtaining Props, solely in reliance upon the information contained in the Props Offering Circular and upon any investigation made by you, but not on any recommendation to participate or use the Service by Listia or any of its affiliates.\n<br>\n<br> 7.13.\nRights.\nYou agree and understand that the receipt of Props (i) does not provide you with rights of any form with respect to Listia or its revenues or assets, including, but not limited to, any voting, distribution, redemption, liquidation, proprietary (including all forms of intellectual property), or other financial or legal rights, (ii) is not a loan to Listia, (iii) does not create any binding obligation enforceable against Listia with respect to Props following their delivery, and (iv) does not provide you with any ownership or other interest in Listia or its platform or the Service.\n<br>\n<br> 7.14.\nSufficient Knowledge.\nBy linking a Wallet to your Listia Account, You agree and represent that you have sufficient knowledge, understanding, and experience, in financial and business matters, and of the functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms, and other material characteristics of cryptographic tokens, token wallets and other token storage mechanisms, public and private key management, blockchain technology, and blockchain-based software systems, including Listia's network and platform, to understand the terms of these Terms and the Props Offering Circular, and such knowledge, understanding, and experience enables you to evaluate the merits and risks of using the Service for purposes of obtaining Props.\n<br>\n<br> 7.15.\nParticipation for Own Account.\nBy linking a Wallet to your Listia Account, You agree and represent that you are using the Service for and receiving any Props in connection with the Service solely for the your own account, and not with a view toward or in connection with distribution, subdivision or fractionalization thereof.\nYou agree not to engage in underwriting or other distribution activity.\nYou have no agreement or other arrangement, formal or informal, with any person or entity to sell, transfer or pledge any Props, or which would guarantee you any profit, or insure against any loss with respect to Props, and you have no plans to enter into any such agreement or arrangement.\n<br>\n<br> 7.16.\nLocation.\nBy linking a Wallet to your Listia Account, You represent and warrant that you: (a) (1) are not located or domiciled.\n(2) do not have a place of business.\nand (3) are not conducting business (any of which would make you a \"Resident\") in a jurisdiction in which access to or use of the Service or Props is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act, (2) a Resident of, or located in, a jurisdiction that is subject to U.S.\nor other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes, or (3) an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce's Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S.\nDepartment of State's Debarred Parties List.\nYou agree that if your country of residence or other circumstances change such that the above representations are no longer accurate, you will immediately cease using the Service and Props and Listia may refuse to deliver Props to you.\n<br>\n<br> 7.17.\nProtections.\nYou understand acknowledge and agree that the distribution of Props contemplated in these Terms and the Props
