Oriented<p>Twilio processes two broad categories of personal information when you use our products and services: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your personal information as a customer (or potential customer) of Twilio\u2019s services \u2014 information that we refer to as <strong>Customer Account Data</strong>, and </li>\n<li>The personal information of your end users who use or interact with your application that you\u2019ve built on Twilio\u2019s platform, like the people you communicate by way of that application \u2014 this category contains both your <strong>Customer Usage Data</strong> (e.g., communications metadata) and your <strong>Customer Content</strong> (e.g., the contents of communications).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Twilio processes these categories of personal information differently because the direct relationship we have with you, our customer, is different than the indirect relationship we have with your end users.</p>How Twilio Processes Your Personal Information<p>Data protection laws and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, like the European Economic Area (EEA), differentiate between \u201ccontrollers\u201d and \u201cprocessors\u201d of personal information.\nA controller decides why and how to process personal information.\n</p>\n<p>A processor processes personal information on behalf of a controller based on the controller\u2019s instructions.\nWhen Twilio processes your Customer Account Data, the Twilio entity with whom you are contracting is acting as a controller.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Broadly speaking, we use Customer Account Data to further our legitimate interests to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>understand who our customers and potential customers are and their interests in Twilio\u2019s product and services, </li>\n<li>manage our relationship with you and other customers, </li>\n<li>carry out core business operations such as accounting, filing taxes, and fulfilling regulatory obligations and</li>\n<li>help detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, fraud and other abuse and/or misuse of our products and services.\n</li>\n</ul>What Personal Information Twilio collects<p>While we\u2019re on the subject of Customer Account Data and Customer Usage Data, we\u2019d like to give you a brief summary of the categories of personal information that might be found in the Customer Account Data and Customer Usage Data that we collect from our customers and their end users, so you can know at a glance what we\u2019re talking about.\n</p>\n<p>We collect and process your personal information: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you visit a Twilio public-facing website like twilio.com, twilio.org, authy.com, or sendgrid.com, sign up for a Twilio event, like SIGNAL, or make a request to receive information about Twilio or our products, like a Twilio whitepaper or a newsletter;</li>\n<li>When you contact our Sales Team or Customer Support Team.\nand</li>\n<li>When you sign up for a Twilio, Authy, or SendGrid account and use our products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We call this personal information <strong>Customer Account Data</strong>.\nWe also collect <strong>Customer Usage Data</strong> from you when you send or receive communications through your use of our services.\nThis data might take different forms, and we might use it for different purposes \u2014 read on for more information.</p>Learn More<p>Depending on your interactions with us, we might collect the following categories of personal information, and for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect <strong>Identifiers</strong>, like your name and contact information (Customer Account Data), when you sign up or use our products or services and to do things like allow you to use our products, verify your identity, and communicate with

device is connected, or Wi-Fi triangulation.</li>\n<li>We collect <strong>Professional or employment information</strong>, such as your company or employer or your role at your company.</li>\n<li>If you attend an event or fill out a form or survey with us, we might collect your age, your gender, or other information that counts as <strong>characteristics of protected classifications</strong>.\nhowever, we will only collect those with your knowledge and opt-in consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can always read more in our API documentation about how we treat personal information we process using our service.\n</p>\n<p>When we\u2019re processing your personal information as our customer, we\u2019re generally processing Customer Account Data or Customer Usage Data.\nWhen we do, we\u2019re a controller, as we described above, and this Privacy Statement details the rules that control our use of that data.</p>\n<p>In addition, as a processor and a service provider, we process Customer Content that may include personal information from any of those categories, plus others.\nIf you\u2019re an end user of a customer of ours, our customer will be able to

information.\nWe collect this information to provide you with what you request through the web form, to learn more about who is interested in our products and services, and to improve navigation experience on our pages.</p>Learn More<p>Information You Share Directly: In some places on Twilio\u2019s public-facing websites, you can fill out web forms to ask to be contacted by our Sales Team, sign up for a newsletter, register for a Twilio event, or take a survey.\nThe specific personal information requested on these forms will vary based on the purpose of the form.\nWe will ask you for information necessary for us to provide you with what you request through the form (for example, we will ask you for your email address if you want to sign up for an email newsletter and for your phone number if you want a member of our Sales Team to call you).\nWe may also ask you for additional information to help us understand you better as a customer like your Twilio use case, your company name, or your role at your company.\nIf you sign up to receive ongoing marketing communications from Twilio, like a newsletter, you can always choose to opt out of further communications through a

Account Data Twilio Processes When You Communicate with Our Sales or Customer Support Teams and Why<p>You may share personal information, like your contact information, with a member of our Sales or Customer Support Team when you communicate with them.\nWe keep a record of this interaction.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn More<p>If you contact our Sales or Customer Support Teams, those teams keep a record of that communication, including your contact details and other information you share during the course of the communication.\nWe store this information to help us keep track of the inquiries we receive from you and from customers generally so we can improve our products and services and provide training to team members.\nThis information also helps our teams manage our ongoing relationships with our customers.\nBecause we store a record of these communications, please be thoughtful about what information you share with our Sales and Customer Support Teams.\nWhile we will take appropriate measures to protect any sensitive information you share with us, it is best to avoid sharing any personal or other sensitive information in these communications not necessary for these teams to assist you.</p>What Customer Account Data Twilio Processes When You Sign Up for and Log Into a Twilio Account and Why<p>When you sign up for an account with us, we ask for certain information like your contact details and billing information so we can communicate with you and so you can pay for our products and services.\nWe also collect some information automatically, like your IP address, when you log in to your account or when your software application built on Twilio makes requests to our APIs.\nWe use this to understand who is using our services and how, and to detect, prevent and investigate fraud, abuse, or security incidents.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn More<p>Information You Share Directly: When you sign up for a Twilio account with us, you\u2019ll be asked to give us your name, email address, and optionally, your company name, and to create a password.\nYou can also name your account (or accounts, if you have more than one).\nWe collect this information so we know who you are, we can communicate with you about your account(s), and we can recognize you when you communicate with us through the account portal or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>When you sign up for a SendGrid account, we ask you for a username, email address, and ask you to create a password.\nSimilarly, we collect this information so we can identify you on our service, provide the service to you, communicate with you about your account, and recognize you when you communicate with us.\n</p>\n<p>We also use your email address to send you information about other Twilio products, services or events in which we think you may be interested.\nYou can opt out of further marketing communications through your marketing preferences page linked from any marketing email you receive from Twilio.\nOr, you can contact our Customer Support Team to communicate your choice to opt-out.</p>\n<p>When you first sign up for an account, we also ask you for a telephone number so we can communicate a verification code to that telephone number and have you enter the code into our website.\nThis helps us ensure you\u2019re actually a human being.\nA Twilio team member may also contact you at this number to help you with onboarding unless you tell us you don\u2019t want us to contact you.</p>\n<p>When you set up two-factor authentication for your account, we\u2019ll ask you to enter a telephone number to set up the process.\nYou have the option to use that telephone number as the method for us to communicate verification codes to you to verify that it is you logging into your account.\nYou can alternatively use the Authy App for verification codes.</p>\n<p>When you upgrade your trial account, we\u2019ll ask you to provide our payment processor with your payment method information like a credit card or your Paypal account, and/or your billing address.\nOur payment processor, acting on our behalf, gathers this so we can bill you for your use of our products and services.\nOur payment processor will share your billing address with Twilio.\nYour billing address may also be used by Twilio for tax calculation and audit purposes.\n</p>\n<p>For some products, we may also obtain a physical address from you that includes a proof of address, name, or other identification information.\nFor example, to get a phone number in certain countries, local law may require us to have a physical service address on file for the individual who will be using that Twilio number, whether that\u2019s you or your end user, and/or proof of identity and physical service address.\nWe call these \u201csubscriber records.\u201d</p>\n<p>We may have to share subscriber records with the local telecommunications carrier that provides local connectivity services or with local government authorities.\nWe may also use this physical service address for tax purposes.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, for some of our products, you or your end user, whoever is going to be making use of the product, may have to complete an application form providing details about your company and your intended use of the product, like when you are interested in getting a short code.\nWe\u2019ll use this information for the purpose for which it was gathered from you.\nWe may also use it in connection with improving our own internal processes and services or training our team members.</p>\n<p>Information We Generate or Collect Automatically.\nWhen you sign up for an account with Twilio, we\u2019ll automatically assign you and your account(s) unique IDs called SIDs and we\u2019ll automatically generate an API token for each of your accounts.\nThese are used like a username and password to make API requests.\nInstead of using these API tokens, you can provision API Keys, and use your API key for authentication when making requests to our APIs.\nWe keep a record of these credentials so we know it is you making the requests when your application makes requests to our API using these credentials.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you use our account portal, we collect your IP address and other data through tracking technologies like cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies.\nWe use this information to understand how customers are using our platform, who those customers are (if they are a company and the IP address is associated with that company), what country they are logging in from (for analytics and export control purposes), and to help improve the navigation experience.\nFor more details on our use of cookies and tracking technologies, please see Twilio\u2019s Cookie Notice, and SendGrid\u2019s page on Website Navigational Information.</p>\n<p>Note that we also collect the IP address of your devices or servers when you make requests to our APIs.\nWhen you use our APIs, we also collect and process the information contained in those interactions.\nFor more information about how personal information is processed in that context, see the

Twilio account portal or our products or services may be used to detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, fraud, or abuse and misuse of our platform and services.\nWe will also use it, and share it with our service providers, as needed for our operational purposes \u2014 such as to do things to function as a business and provide our services to you.</p>Other Customer Account Data We Collect and Why<p>We may collect information about you, as our customer, from publicly-available sources so we can understand our customer base better.</p>Learn More<p>We may use publicly-available information about you through services like LinkedIn, or we may obtain information about your company from third party providers to help us understand our customer base better, such as your industry,

services and to operate our business.\nIf you ask Twilio to delete specific personal information from your Customer Account Data (see \u2018How To Make Choices About Your Customer Account Data\u2019

</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communications-related personal information about your end users, like your end users\u2019 phone numbers for number-based communications, your end users\u2019 email addresses for email communications, IP addresses for IP-based communications, device status (indicating whether a device is available for messaging), or device tokens for push notifications, show up in our systems when you use or intend to use this information to contact your end user through use of our products and services.</li>\n<li>Your end users\u2019 personal information may show up in \u201cfriendly names,\u201d which are strings you provide, if you choose to include your end users\u2019 personal information as part of a string.\n</li>\n<li>Your end users\u2019 personal information may also be contained in the content of communications you (or your end users) send or receive using Twilio\u2019s products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We call the information in the first two bullets above <strong>Customer Usage Data</strong>.\nThe information in the third bullet is what we refer to as <strong>Customer Content</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>As noted above, data protection law (including privacy law) in certain jurisdictions, like the EEA, differentiate between \u201ccontrollers\u201d and \u201cprocessors\u201d of personal information.\nWhen Twilio processes Customer Content, we generally act as a processor.\nWhen we process Customer Usage Data, we act as a processor in many respects, but we may act as a controller in others.\nFor example, we may need to use certain Customer Usage Data for the legitimate interests of billing, reconciling invoices with telecommunications carriers, and in the context of troubleshooting and detecting problems with the network.</p>What Customer Usage Data and Customer Content Twilio Processes and Why<p>We use Customer Usage Data and Customer Content to provide services to you and to carry out necessary functions of our business as a communications service provider.\nWe do not sell your end users\u2019 personal information and we do not share your end users\u2019 information with third parties for those third parties\u2019 own business interests.\n</p>Learn More<p>The particular end user personal information Twilio processes when you, our customer, use our products and services and the reason Twilio processes depends on how you use our products and services and which Twilio products and services you use.\nFor that reason, our API docs for each of our products and services are the best place to find information about our processing of personal information when you use that Twilio product and service.\n</p>\n<p>In many cases, you can opt to store records of your communications, or other activities, on Twilio, which may include your end users\u2019 personal information.\nYou may also have the option to use additional features or tools within Twilio\u2019s products or services that allow you to do things such as analyze the records, including end user personal information, in your Twilio account.\nIn those cases, Twilio will process this information to provide you with the service you request.</p>\n<p>In addition, records containing end user personal information may, from time to time, also be used in debugging or troubleshooting or in connection with investigations of security incidents, as well as for the purposes of detecting and preventing spam or fraudulent activity, and detecting and preventing network exploits and abuse.\nIt may also be anonymized, as allowed by law, and we may use data that can no longer identify you or relate to you for our legitimate business needs.</p>How Long Do We Store Customer Usage Data and Customer Content and Exercising Choices About End User Personal Information<p>Details regarding how long your end user personal information may be stored on Twilio systems and how to delete, access, or exercise other choices about end user data will depend on which Twilio products and services you are using and how you are using them.\nFor that reason, our API docs for each of our products and services, along with SendGrid\u2019s documentation, are the best place to find more detailed information about managing end user data collected and stored in connection with your use of our products and services, as well as the particular data retention periods for your use case.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn More<p>As a Twilio customer, if the Twilio product or service you use enables you to store records of your usage on Twilio, including personal information contained within those records, and you choose to do so, then Twilio will retain these records for as long you instruct.\nIn some cases, use of extended storage may cost more.\nIf you later instruct us to delete those records, we will do so.\nPlease note that it may take up to 30 days for the data to be completely removed from all systems.\nIn some cases, a copy of those records, including the personal information contained in them, may nonetheless be retained to carry out necessary functions like billing, invoice reconciliation, troubleshooting, and detecting, preventing, and investigating spam, fraudulent activity, and network exploits and abuse.\nSometimes legal matters arise that also require us to preserve records, including those containing personal information.\nThese matters include litigation, law enforcement requests, or government investigations.\nIf we have to do this, we will delete the impacted records when no longer legally obligated to retain them.\nWe may, however, retain or use records after they have been anonymized, if the law allows.\n</p>When and Why We Share Your Personal Information Or Your End Users\u2019 Personal Information<p>We do not sell or allow your Customer Account Data to be used by third parties for their own marketing purposes, unless you ask us to do this or give us your consent to do this.\nFurther, we do not sell your end users\u2019 personal information.\nWe also do not share it with third parties for their own marketing or other purposes, unless you instruct us to do so.\nYou can read more in our CCPA Notice.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn More<p>Below are the different scenarios under which we may share your data with third parties.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Telephony operators as necessary for proper routing and connectivity.\nTwilio provides an easier way for developers to build applications that make use of the publicly switched telephone network (PSTN) to send communications.\nTherefore, communications-related data is shared with and received from telephony operators as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient.\nHow those telephony operators handle this data is generally determined by those operators\u2019 own policies and local regulations.</li>\n<li>Other communications service providers for proper routing and connectivity.\nTwilio also enables sending or receiving communications through communications service providers that do not use the PSTN, such as Viber and Facebook Messenger (referred to as Over-the-Top (OTT) communications service providers).\nIf you choose to use Twilio to send or receive communications by way of these providers, Twilio will share communications data with these providers as necessary to route and connect those communications from the sender to the intended recipient.\nHow those OTT communications service providers handle this data is determined by their own policies.</li>\n<li>Third-party service providers or consultants.\nTwilio engages certain third-party service providers to carry out certain data processing functions on our behalf.\nThese providers are limited to only accessing or using this data to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances they will appropriately safeguard the data.\nIn addition, Twilio uses Sift Science as a service provider to help us detect potentially fraudulent or malicious accounts or customer activity.\nSift Science uses machine learning as part of its service and certain Customer Account Data Twilio shares with them may be used in building machine learning models to help detect potential fraud or malicious activity that not only benefits Twilio, but other Sift Science customers as well.\nSift Science provides additional information about their data practices in their privacy notice.\nTwilio does not share end user personal data with Sift Science.</li>\n<li>Sub-processors.\nWe may share Customer Content with sub-processors who assist in providing the Twilio services, like our infrastructure provider, or as necessary to provide optional functionality like transcriptions.\nAn up-to-date list of Twilio's sub-processors is located here.</li>\n<li>Add-on Partners.\nAdd-ons are additional features, functionality or services offered by Twilio\u2019s Add-on Partners (third parties not affiliated with Twilio).\nTwilio may make Add-ons available through the Twilio Marketplace.\nSome Add-ons may need to access or collect some of your information, including personal information.\nIf you choose to use an Add-on, Twilio will share your information with the Add-on Partner so you can use the Add-on.\nTwilio does not control Add-on Partners\u2019 use of your information and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own policies.\nIf you do not want your information to be shared with an Add-on Partner, then you should not use the Add-on.</li>\n<li>Compliance with Legal Obligations.\nWe may disclose your or your end users\u2019 personal information to a third party if (i) we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process, or a government request (including to meet national security, emergency services, or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose data to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.\nIf Twilio is required by law to disclose any personal information of you or your end user, we will notify you of the disclosure requirement, unless prohibited by law.\nFurther, we object to requests we do not believe were issued properly.\nYou can read more in our Law Enforcement Guidelines.</li>\n<li>Other Twilio Group Entities.\nWe may share your personal information or your end users\u2019 personal information within the Twilio group of companies, such as with a subsidiary of Twilio Inc.\nWe and our subsidiaries will only use the information as described in this notice.</li>\n<li>Business transfers.\nIf we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, data we gather from you may be part of the assets transferred or shared in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction.\nIn that situation, and that situation only, we might transfer your data in a way that constitutes a sale under applicable law.\nIf we do, we\u2019ll let you know ahead of time, and any acquirer or successor of Twilio may continue to process data consistent with this notice.</li>\n<li>Aggregated or de-identified data.\nWe might also share data with third parties if the data has been de-identified or aggregated in a way so it cannot be used to identify you or your end users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re a Californian interested in what personal information we have shared lately for our business purposes, here\u2019s a list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers</li>\n<li>Commercial information</li>\n<li>Financial information</li>\n<li>Internet or other electronic activity information</li>\n<li>Geolocation information</li>\n<li>Professional or employment information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By \u201cour business purposes,\u201d we mean that we only share personal information as we describe in this section (in other words, with telephony operators, communications providers, and so on).</p>Transfers of Personal Information Out of the EEA and Switzerland<p>When you use our account portal, or our other products and services, personal information of you and your end users processed by Twilio may be transferred to the United States, where our primary processing facilities are located, and possibly to other countries where we or our service providers operate.\nThese transfers will often be made in connection with routing your communications in the most efficient way.\n</p>\n<p>Twilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal data, as required by applicable local law, including Binding Corporate Rules and Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>Learn More<p>While Twilio relies on strong transfer mechanisms to protect the data we transfer across borders, we understand that data transfer mechanisms do not operate in a vacuum.\nYou can read more about the appropriate technical and operational safeguards Twilio has taken to safeguard our customers' personal data.\nBut first, an overview of our transfer mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Twilio\u2019s Binding Corporate Rules.</strong> Twilio has established and implemented a set of Binding Corporate Rules (\u201cBCRs\u201d) for internal transfers of personal information between Twilio group companies in the European Union and Twilio group companies elsewhere.\nTwilio\u2019s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal information that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides.\nYou can access Twilio\u2019s BCR controller and processor policies here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Standard Contractual Clauses.</strong> Where Twilio\u2019s BCRs do not apply, including to cross-border data transfers of the SendGrid services, we rely instead on other safeguards to transfer personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland, such as European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Twilio's Data Protection Addendum.</strong> For more information about our cross-border data transfer mechanisms, please see the Data Protection Addendum which is part of your agreement with us.\nWe provide this DPA by default, as an additional layer of protection for all our customers.</p>SendGrid Services<p>The SendGrid services work a little differently from the rest of Twilio\u2019s services, and we\u2019d like to make sure you\u2019re aware of those differences.\nMost importantly, SendGrid services are not currently covered by Twilio\u2019s Binding Corporate Rules, which means that we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (which you can find in our Data Protection Addendum) for any cross-border data transfers relating to the SendGrid services.\nHowever, even where SendGrid services are not covered by our Binding Corporate Rules, we are committed to providing a high level of data protection for our SendGrid customers.\nThere are a few other elements that are specific to the SendGrid services, and you should read on for more information.</p>Learn MoreData Collection and Email <p>For the most part, the SendGrid services collect the same data the Twilio services collect, and for the same reasons.\nThe SendGrid services also collect some additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform.\nThis allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam.\nYou may learn more about these web beacons on our Website Navigational Information page.</p>Customer Content and Email Recipients\u2019 Personal Information<p>Like Twilio, SendGrid is a data processor for Customer Content, like email communications contents and the contents of marketing campaigns.\nSendGrid is also a data processor for email recipients\u2019 email addresses and other recipients\u2019 personal information.</p>Data Subject Rights and Opt Outs<p>SendGrid takes reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and up to date.\nYou can manage, access, or delete many of your account and profile settings within the dashboard provided through the SendGrid platform, including, in some instances, your end users\u2019 personal information.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of our marketing messages.\nPlease note that it may take up to three days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request.\nYou will not be able to opt out of service emails from us, such as billing emails, unless you deactivate your account.</p>Automated Decision Making <p>Twilio may use automated decision making using a variety of signals derived from account activity to help identify and suspend accounts sending spam or engaged in other abusive or fraudulent activity.\nHolders of accounts suspended under these circumstances are notified of the suspension and given an opportunity to request human review of the suspension decision.</p>Handling disputes relating to our data protection practices<p>We hope we can resolve any disputes relating to our data protection practices between us.\nYou can raise your concern or dispute by emailing our Privacy Team at privacy@twilio.com or by writing to us at: </p>\n<p>Twilio Inc., 375 Beale Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94105 (our worldwide headquarters)</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>Twilio Ireland Limited, 25-28 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland (our EEA headquarters).</p>\n<p>For individuals in the EEA, you have additional rights to make a complaint to a competent data protection authority or commence proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable data protection laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn More<p>If you have a dispute with us relating to our data protection practices, please contact us by email at privacy@twilio.com.\n</p>\n<p>If we can\u2019t resolve the dispute through those channels and you are not in the EEA or Switzerland, please see Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate) of our Terms of Service, which describes how disputes will be resolved between us.\nAs described in that section, the American Arbitration Association (http://www.adr.org) will conduct the dispute resolution proceedings.\nPlease be sure to review our Terms of Service, including Section 18, before you use any of our products and services.</p>\n<p>For those in the EEA or Switzerland, if you have a dispute with us relating to our data protection practices or are not satisfied with how we\u2019ve addressed your concerns or questions, you may complain to an independent dispute resolution provider, at no cost to you.\nWe outline this process in our Privacy Shield Statement (while we do not rely on Privacy Shield for data transfers, we continue to comply with the framework, including its dispute resolution process).\n</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the EEA, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland (where our EEA headquarters are based).\n</p>\n<p>Irish Data Protection

We Secure Personal Information<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline.\nThese measures vary based on the sensitivity of the personal information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.\nWe also take measures to ensure service providers that process personal data on our behalf also have appropriate security controls in place.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn More<p>Please note that no service is completely secure.\nWhile we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur.</p>\n<p>To protect the confidentiality of your account and protect from unauthorized use of your account, we recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your account.\nAdditionally, you must keep your account password and Auth Token confidential and not disclose them publicly or to unauthorized individuals \u2014 this includes accidentally distributing them in a binary or checking them into source control.\nPlease let us know right away if you think your password or Auth Token was compromised or misused.\nFor instructions on changing your password, click here.\nFor instructions on changing your Auth Token, click here.\n</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you provision an API Key, you should keep your secret, well...\nsecret.\nYou should store your API Key Account SID and secret in a secure location.\nInformation on provisioning and revoking API Keys can be found here.\n</p>Other Information You May Find Useful<p>Here\u2019s some other information about our privacy practices, such as how we handle certain types of data like children\u2019s data or protected health information, how we handle do-not-track signals, what to expect if we make changes to our notice, and the legal bases for processing personal information.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Learn MoreInformation from Children<p>We do not knowingly permit children (under the age of 13 in the US or 16, if you live in the EEA) to sign up for a Twilio account.\nIf we discover someone who is underage has signed up for a Twilio account, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that person\u2019s personal information from our records.\nIf you believe a person who is underage has signed up for a Twilio account, please contact us at privacy@twilio.com.</p>Do-Not-Track Signals<p>Twilio does not currently respond to web browser\u2019s Do-Not-Track signals.\nYou can learn more about Do Not Track here, and you can learn more about the cookies the Twilio website sets here and, for the SendGrid website, here.</p>Changes to Our Privacy Notice<p>We may change our Privacy Notice from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we\u2019ll revise the \u201cEffective\u201d date at the top of this notice, and we may provide additional notice such as on the Twilio website homepage, account portal sign-in page, or via the email address we have on file for you.\nWe will comply with applicable law with respect to any changes we make to this notice and seek your consent to any material changes if this is required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information (EEA only)</p>\n<p>If you are from the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\n</p>\n<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent to do so.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person such as in the case where we request personal information from you in the context of a government audit or in response to a request from law enforcement.</p>\n<p>If you have

desktop and mobile app for two-step verification.\nThe Authy apps generate one time passwords and push notifications on your desktop computer or mobile device that can be used as a part of a 2-step verification process with your Authy-compatible accounts to add another layer of security.\nAuthy can be used as an alternative to programs such as Google Authenticator or as a provider of 2-factor authentication for applications or programs that directly integrate with Authy\u2019s 2-factor authentication API.</p>\n<p>Below is a summary of our practices when it comes to your personal information collected when you download and use the Authy desktop or mobile app.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in our practices relating to personal information collected when you build an application that integrates with Authy\u2019s API to add two-factor authentication to your application, click here.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this notice, the words \u201cour,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cAuthy,\u201d and \u201cTwilio\u201d refer to Twilio Inc.\nand our affiliates (which includes any person or entity that controls us, is controlled by us, or is under common control with us, such as our subsidiary, parent company, or our employees).\nIf you are a user outside of the United States, this service is provided to you by Twilio Ireland Limited, located at 25-28 North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland.\nTwilio Ireland Limited is the controller of personal information processed in connection with your use of the Authy apps.</p>\n<p>Before you submit any information on or through Authy, please carefully review this notice.</p>What personal information we collect, how we collect it and why<p>\n<strong>Identifiers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device Information</strong>.\nWhen you download and open the Authy desktop or mobile app, we automatically collect information about the type of device you have downloaded the app on and your device identifier.\nWe collect this to ensure we deliver the right version of the app for your device and so that we can provide appropriate follow up support as necessary.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Phone Number and Email Address</strong>.\nOnce you open the Authy app, we ask you to provide us with a phone number to create your Authy account.\nWe send a verification code to that phone number to be sure that the person creating the Authy account also has control over the phone number entered.\nAfter the phone number is verified, the phone number you use will be the identifier for your Authy account that allows you to add and associate additional devices to your same Authy account.\nThe device on which you first created your Authy account is considered your \u201cprimary device.\u201d You may also enter your email address.</p>\n<p>If you are a user of an application or program that directly integrates with Authy\u2019s 2-Factor Authentication API, those applications or programs collect your phone number and email address and share that information with us so we can use it to associate your account on that application or program with your Authy account that you created when you downloaded the Authy app.</p>\n<p>If you have not downloaded the Authy app, but use an application or program that directly integrates with Authy\u2019s 2-Factor Authentication API, when that application or program shares your phone number and email address with us, we will create an Authy account for you.\nWe will use your phone number to communicate to you verification codes so you can log into your account on that application or program.</p>\n<p>We collect your email address as another piece of information to validate who you are if you need to recover your account or your account has been compromised, and also to communicate notices about your account to you like suspicious logins or other activity that could be related to a compromise of your Authy account or one of your accounts in other applications or programs that integrate with the Authy 2-Factor Authentication API.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Identity Confirmation Information</strong>.\nIf you need to change your phone number associated with your account but are not able to access your Authy app to change your number under Settings, you can submit a request to change your phone number here.\nIf we cannot easily confirm that you are the rightful account holder of the Authy account associated with your old number, we will ask you for your phone account information and a copy of physical identification such as a drivers\u2019 license, national ID, or passport, which we then use to confirm your claim to the account.\nFrom time to time, if there are other situations where we need to verify that you are the rightful account holder of your Authy account, our support team may require you to provide identity information like a drivers\u2019 license, national ID or passport.</p>\n<p>Internet or other electronic network activity information:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Login History and Authy Account History.</strong> When you use an Authy token to log into an account, whether the token was generated on the app or one sent to you via your phone number, we collect and keep information associated with your login activity including information like your IP address, what application or program you logged in to, that you logged in, and when.\nIf you change your phone number or email associated with your Authy account, we will also keep a log of that.\nWe collect this information to monitor for suspicious activity and also as another piece of information that could be used to verify your identity if your account is compromised or may be compromised.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Geolocation information:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have location services turned on, we collect your location location based on your IP address.\nWe use this information for anti-fraud purposes, to check for suspicious activity and, again, as another piece of information we can use to verify your identity if we suspect your account may be compromised.</p>\n<p>\n</p>What we use your personal information for<p>We use your phone number as an identifier for your Authy account.\nThis allows you to download the Authy app onto various devices and associate those devices with your same Authy account.\nWe may also use your phone number to send you verification codes as a second factor for authenticating a login for an application that integrates with the Authy 2-Factor Authentication API.\nWe also use logs of any changes to your phone number to monitor for suspicious or unusual activity and as another piece of information that could be used, if necessary, to verify your identity if your account is or may be compromised.</p>\n<p>We use your email address, and any history of email addresses associated with your Authy account, as another piece of information that could be used, if necessary, to verify your identity if your account is or may be compromised.\nWe also use your email address to communicate notices to you about your account, such as suspicious logins or other activity that could indicate a compromise of your account.\nIn addition, we may use your email address to send you information about other Authy and Twilio products, services, or events that you might be interested in.\nYou can choose not to receive marketing emails from us.\nIf you wish to stop receiving our marketing emails you may click on the unsubscribe link that will appear at the bottom of any of our marketing emails or you can contact customer support.</p>\n<p>We use information associated with your login activity, device information, and changes to your account to monitor for unusual or suspicious activity on your account and as any other piece of information that could be used to help us verify your identity if your account is compromised or may be compromised.</p>\n<p>In addition to using device information as described above, we also use your device information ensure proper delivery of our service and to provide and deliver support and maintenance of the Authy app.</p>\n<p>Your personal information is generally stored until you advise us to close your Authy account and delete your records, and activity logs may be stored for up to a year for security purposes, or, if there is an ongoing investigation, until that matter is concluded.</p>Who we may share your personal information with<p>Authy does not sell your personal information, share it with third parties for their own marketing purposes, nor do we allow third parties to use it for their own marketing purposes, unless you ask us to do this.\nYou can read more in our CCPA Notice.</p>\n<p>An application or program that integrates with the Authy 2-Factor API is able to access a record of the email address and phone number that it sent to Authy.\nIt will also be able to access your primary device type and information associated with your login activity to that application or program.\nIt may also retain this information on its own servers.\nWe may also share other information related to your account with that application or program to help them and us detect suspicious or fraudulent activity on your account.\nThose applications or programs will not be able to see other accounts for which you use Authy to provide 2-factor authentication, however.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may share your information with third parties as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third-party service providers or consultants.\nWe may share your personal information with third-party service providers or consultants who need access to the personal information to perform their work on our behalf, like sharing personal information with our storage provider for the purposes of storing your personal information on our behalf.\nThese third-party service providers are limited to only accessing or using this personal information to provide services to us and must provide reasonable assurances that they will appropriately safeguard the personal information.</li>\n<li>Compliance with Laws.\nWe may disclose your personal information to a third party if (i) we reasonably believe that disclosure is compelled by applicable law, regulation, legal process or a government request (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), (ii) to enforce our agreements and policies, (iii) to protect the security or integrity of our services and products, (iv) to protect ourselves, our other customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (v) to respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose personal information to assist in preventing a death or serious bodily injury.\nIf we are required by law to disclose your personal information, we will notify you of that disclosure requirement, unless prohibited by law.\nFurther, we object to requests that we do not believe were issued properly.</li>\n<li>Other Twilio Group entities.\nWe may share your personal information or your end users\u2019 personal information within the Twilio group of companies, such as with a subsidiary of Twilio Inc.\nWe and our subsidiaries will only use the information as described in this notice.</li>\n<li>Business transfers.\nIf we go through a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal information we gather from you may be part of the assets transferred or shared in connection with the due diligence for any such transaction.\nAny acquirer or successor may continue to use the personal information as described in this notice.</li>\n<li>Aggregated or de-identified information.\nWe might also share information with third parties if that information has been de-identified or aggregated in a way that does not identify you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the last year, we have shared <strong>Identifiers</strong> and <strong>Internet or other electronic network activity information</strong> with third parties, as we describe in this section.\nYou can reach out to us for more information by contacting our Support team.</p>\n<p>If you use the Authy app when logging into a website or application that has not integrated the Authy 2-Factor API (i.e., you are using the Authy app as an alternative to Google Authenticator, typically by adding the website or application to your Authy App through scanning a QR code), the soft token you will see will be a 6 digit code.\nAuthy does not share your information with these websites or applications.</p>International operations and transfers out of the European Economic Area and Switzerland<p>Your personal information may be transferred to the United States, and possibly other countries where we or our service providers operate.\nTwilio employs appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers of personal information, as required by applicable local law.</p>\n<p>Twilio has established and implemented a set of Binding Corporate Rules (\u201cBCRs\u201d) for internal transfers of Authy personal information between Twilio group companies in the European Union and Twilio group companies elsewhere.\nTwilio\u2019s BCRs have been approved by European Union Data Protection Authorities and are a commitment by Twilio to adequately protect personal information that Twilio processes regardless of where the information resides.\nYou can access Twilio\u2019s BCR controller policy here.</p>\n<p>Where Twilio\u2019s BCRs do not apply, we will rely instead on other safeguards to transfer personal information outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, such as European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses.\nYou can read more about these in the main Twilio Privacy Statement and in the Data Protection Addendum that we provide to all our customers.</p>Information from children<p>We do not knowingly permit children (under the age of 13 in the US or 16, if you live in the EEA) to sign up for an Authy account.\nIf we discover that someone who is underage has signed up for an Authy account, we will take reasonable steps to promptly remove that person\u2019s personal information from our records.\nIf you believe that a person who is underage has signed up for an Authy account, please contact us at privacy@twilio.com.</p>How we secure your personal information<p>We use appropriate measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline.\nThese measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.\nPlease note though that no service is completely secure.\nSo, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss or a data breach will never occur.</p>\n<p>There are also things you can do to add extra protection to your Authy account.\nFirst, you should password protect or activate biometrics (like Touch ID) for all devices on which you have downloaded the Authy app.\nThis will prevent unauthorized users from accessing your Authy app.\nFurther, you have the option of setting a protection pin for your Authy app.\nYou can do this by going into your app and clicking on settings.\nIn settings, you should click on \u201cProtection Pin.\u201d You can choose to include a Protection Pin which will require you to enter a pin number of your choosing before accessing settings and your Account Info.\nDepending on your device\u2019s capabilities, you may also be able to add biometric protection.\nYou can also choose to protect the entire app which will require you to enter your chosen Pin and/or use biometric to open the Authy app on your device.\nWe recommend that if you have downloaded Authy onto a shared device, that you use this last option of protecting the entire app.</p>\n<p>If you have multiple devices associated with your account and one of your devices is lost or stolen, you can remove that device from your circle of trusted devices by going into one of the other devices associated with your account, and over which you still control, and remove the lost or stolen device under Settings &gt.\nDevices.\nIf you only have a single device that is associated with your Authy account and that device is lost or stolen, you can alert us through customer service.</p>How we tell you about changes to our privacy practices<p>We may change our Privacy Notice from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we\u2019ll revise the \u201cLast Effective\u201d date at the top of this notice, and we may provide additional notice such as on the Twilio website homepage, in the app, or via the email address we have on file for you.\nWe will comply with applicable law with respect to any changes we make to this notice, and seek your consent to any material changes if this is required by applicable law.</p>How to make choices about your personal information<p>You can make updates to your information associated with your account by going into the settings in the Authy apps.\nYou can also make a request to change your phone number associated with your account by clicking here.</p>\n<p>You may have certain rights to make choices regarding your personal information, including accessing it, deleting it, correcting it, restricting its use, porting it, or withdrawing consent.\nTo make a request for deletion of your Authy account, to make a request to access additional information associated with your account, or to express any other choice regarding your personal information, contact Authy Support or privacy@twilio.com.\nPlease be aware that when you ask us for these things, we will take steps to verify that you are authorized to make the request.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that when you ask us for your personal information, or you ask us to delete your personal information, we may need to withhold or retain some of that personal information for security, legal, or anti-fraud reasons.\nAlso, we do need some of the personal information we have to maintain customer accounts.\nIf you ask us to delete that information, we may not be able to continue providing you our services.\n</p>\n<p>If you want to remove a program or application from your Authy account that uses the Authy 2-Factor API, but you do not want to delete your entire Authy account, you should contact the provider of the program or application that you want to remove.</p>\n<p>Promotional communications.\nIn addition, you can choose not to receive promotional emails from us by following the unsubscribe/opt-out instructions in those emails.\nYou can also opt-out by contacting customer support.\nPlease note that even if you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional messages relating to things like updates to our terms of service or privacy notices, security alerts, and other notices relating to your access to or use of our products and services.</p>How to resolve disputes relating to our privacy practices<p>If you have a dispute with us relating to our privacy practices, please contact our customer support or email us at privacy@twilio.com or contact our Customer Support.\nMost disputes can be resolved that way.\nIf we can\u2019t resolve our dispute that way, and you live in the U.S.\nor Canada, please see Section 17 (Agreement to Arbitrate) of our Terms of Service , which describes how disputes will be resolved between us.\nAs described in that section, the American Arbitration Association will conduct the dispute resolution proceedings.\nPlease be sure to review our Terms of Service, including Section 17, before you use any of our products and services.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re in Europe, you may complain to an independent dispute resolution provider, at no cost to you.\nWe outline this process in our Privacy Shield Statement (while we do not rely on Privacy Shield for data transfers, we continue to comply with the framework, including its dispute resolution process).</p>\n<p>For

Services for non-payment of fees as described in Section 10.3 (Suspension for Non-Payment), we may also suspend the Services immediately upon notice for cause if: (a) you violate (or give us reason to believe you have violated) any provision of these Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy.\n(b) there is reason to believe the traffic created from your use of the Services or your use of the Services is fraudulent or negatively impacting the operating capability of the Services.\n(c) we determine, in our sole discretion, that providing the Services is prohibited by applicable law, or it has become

circumstances leading to the suspension (e.g., to certain phone numbers, sub-accounts or other subset of traffic).\nand (z) remove the suspension as quickly as reasonably practicable after the circumstances leading to the suspension have been resolved.\nIf your account is blocked because you are operating in a country or region prohibited under Section 12.1.4 (Export Controls), you will receive notice of your account being inoperable when you attempt to log into your account in the restricted country or region.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>5.4 Building Regulated Services</p>\n<p>Twilio offers both non-interconnected and interconnected VoIP products.\nIf you purchase an interconnected VoIP product, you are&nbsp.\nresponsible, just like Twilio, to comply with the regulatory requirements, taxes, and fees imposed on interconnected VoIP services.\nIf you purchases a non-interconnected VoIP product or service from Twilio, it is still possible for you to build an interconnected VoIP service with Twilio's non-interconnected VoIP product.\nIf you build an interconnected VoIP service (regardless of which Twilio product is purchased), you will be responsible to comply with the regulatory requirements, taxes, and fees imposed on interconnected VoIP services.</p> 6.\nChanges to the Services.\n<p>\n<em>We are always looking to innovate and make our services better, so our APIs

and our SLA, may change over time.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to the Services are compatible with our then-current Services.\nAlthough we try to avoid making changes to the Services that are not backwards compatible, if any such changes become necessary, we will use reasonable efforts to let you know at least sixty (60) days prior to implementing those changes.</p> 7.\nBeta Offerings.\n<p>\n<em>You have the choice to use our Beta Offerings.\nBut you don\u2019t have to.\nThese are not generally available, and they may have bugs or defects.\nAlso we

Offerings won\u2019t have problems.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You understand that we will not be liable for any damages from your use of Beta Offerings.</em>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, Twilio may make Beta Offerings available to you.&nbsp.\nYou may choose to try such Beta Offerings or not in your sole discretion.\nTwilio may discontinue Beta Offerings at any time in our sole discretion and may decide not to make a Beta Offering generally available.\nFor avoidance of doubt, such Beta Offerings are not \u201cServices\u201d under these Terms.\n\u201cBeta Offerings\u201d means services that are identified as alpha, beta, non-GA, limited release, developer preview, or any such similarly designated services, products, features, and documentation offered by Twilio.</p> 8.\nAffiliates <p>\n<em>Your affiliates (namely a parent company or a subsidiary that your own company controls) can use our Services, and&nbsp.\nyou and your affiliates will both be responsible for everything that your affiliates do when they\u2019re using our Services.\nThat includes any violations&nbsp.\nof these Terms of Service.\nIf your affiliate want to bring a claim against Twilio, then only you may bring that claim on your affiliate\u2019s behalf.\nOf course, your affiliates can also accept our Terms and order their own Services.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Your affiliates mean any entity or person that controls you, is controlled by you, or under common control with you, such as a subsidiary, parent company, or employee.\nThe term \u201ccontrol\u201d means more than 50% ownership.\nSimilarly, if we refer to our affiliates, we mean an entity or person that controls us, is controlled by us, or is under common control with us.\nYour affiliates are not permitted to purchase Services using the Terms of Service that you accepted.\nInstead your affiliates will need to accept the Terms themselves.\nIf your affiliates use the Services under these Terms, then you and those affiliates will be jointly and severally responsible for the acts and omissions of your affiliates, including, but not limited to, their breach of these Terms.\nAny claim from any of your affiliates that use the Services pursuant to these Terms may only be brought against us by you on your affiliates\u2019 behalf.</p> 9.\nProduct Terms <p>\n<em>Review the product terms in the navigation bar.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Refer to

account(s) up with sufficient funds to cover your monthly fees.\nIf you do not have sufficient funds in your Twilio account(s) to cover your monthly fees, then we may suspend our services.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If we approve you for invoicing, you agree to pay all fees that you owe to Twilio in US dollars, unless we agree to another currency in writing, no later than 30 days after the date of the invoice.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you don\u2019t pay on time, then we may send you a late notice.\nIf we don\u2019t get your payment within 10 days after the date on the late

anything bad that might happen as a result.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you ever think that we charged you the wrong amount and you want to dispute it, then let us know, in writing, within 60 days of billing date for the charge in question.\nYou have to be reasonable when disputing an invoice.\nYou must be acting in good faith and cooperating with us to resolve the problem.</em>\n</p>\n<p>10.1 Fees.\nYou agree to pay fees in accordance with the rates listed at&nbsp;twilio.com/pricing and sendgrid.com/pricing, unless otherwise set forth in an order form or order confirmation between the parties (an <em>\u201c</em>\n<strong>\n<em>Order Form</em>\n</strong>\n<em>\u201d</em>).</p>\n<p>Additionally, we will charge you, and you shall pay, in accordance with Section 10.3, any and all additional costs, fines, or penalties we incur from a governmental or regulatory body or telecommunication provider as a result of your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>10.2 Taxes.\nUnless otherwise stated in an Order Form, you shall be responsible for and shall pay all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Services that are the subject of this Agreement.&nbsp.\n<em>\u201c</em>\n<strong>\n<em>Taxes</em>\n</strong>\n<em>\u201d</em> mean all applicable federal, state and local taxes, fees, charges, telecommunications provider (e.g., carrier) surcharges or other similar exactions, including, without limitation, sales and use taxes, communications service taxes, utility user\u2019s taxes or fees, excise taxes, VAT, GST, other license or business and occupations taxes, 911 taxes, franchise fees and universal service fund fees or taxes.\nFor purposes of this Section 10.2, Taxes do not include any Taxes that are imposed on or measured by our net income, property tax, or payroll taxes.\nIf you are exempt from any such Taxes for any reason, we will exempt you from such Taxes on a going-forward basis once you deliver a duly executed and dated valid exemption certificate to our tax department and our tax department has approved such exemption certificate.\nSuch exemptions should be sent directly to taxforms@twilio.com.\nFor avoidance of doubt, the Customer will not be exempt from the Federal Universal Service Fund fees unless the Customer itself is a direct contributor to the Federal Universal Service Fund and has a contributor number that can be verified through the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website.\nIf you are exempt from VAT or GST, then it is your responsibility to provide your VAT or GST registration number to us.\nIf you provide us an exemption certificate or your VAT or GST number after you have paid Taxes, then we will provide, upon your written request, a credit to your customer account for Taxes previously paid for up to a period of three (3) months from the date of receipt of your written request.\nIf for any reason a taxing jurisdiction determines that you are not exempt from any such exempted Taxes and then assesses us such Taxes, you agree to promptly pay to us such Taxes, plus any applicable interest or penalties assessed.</p>\n<p>Should you be required by applicable law to withhold any tax from any payment owed to us, then you may provide us with an exemption certificate or similar document to reduce or eliminate any such withholding.\nUpon receipt of such certificate or document, you shall thereafter reduce or eliminate, as the case may be, such withholding.\nYou shall provide us with documents evidencing your payment of any such withheld Tax to applicable tax authorities.</p>\n<p>10.3 Payment Terms.\nYou will make all of the payments due hereunder in accordance with the following applicable payment method:</p>\n<p>10.3.1 Credit Card Payment Terms.\nIf you elect to pay via credit card, then you are responsible for either (a) enabling auto-recharge on your customer account(s) or (b) ensuring that your customer account(s) has a sufficient positive balance to cover all fees due.\nIf, for any reason, you have a negative balance on your customer account(s), then we reserve the right to suspend the Services.</p>\n<p>10.3.2 Invoicing Payment Terms.\nIf you elect to receive invoices and pay in arrears and we approve you for the same, then invoices will be sent to you via email as a PDF on a monthly basis.\nYou will make all of the undisputed fees hereunder within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice.\nUnless you and Twilio agree otherwise in writing, all undisputed fees due pursuant to these Terms are payable in United States dollars, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties in writing.\nPayment obligations can\u2019t be canceled, and fees paid are non-refundable.\nIf you are overdue on any payment of undisputed fees and fail to pay within ten (10) business days of a written notice of your overdue payment, then we may assess, and you must pay a late fee.\nThe late fee will be either 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by applicable law, whichever is less.\nFollowing the notice of non-payment, we may also suspend the Services until you pay the undisputed fees due plus any late fees.</p>\n<p>10.3.3 Suspension for Non-Payment.\nIf we suspend the Services pursuant to this Section 10.3, then we will have no liability for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits) or any other consequences that you may incur in connection with any such suspension.</p>\n<p>10.4 Fee Disputes.\nIf you are disputing any fees or Taxes, you must act reasonably and in good faith and you must cooperate diligently with Twilio to resolve the dispute.\nYou must notify us in writing if you dispute any portion of any fees paid or payable by you pursuant to these Terms.\nYou must provide that written notice to us within sixty (60) days of the date we bill you for the charge you want to dispute, and we will work together with you to resolve the dispute promptly.</p> 11.\nOwnership and Confidentiality <p>\n<em>What\u2019s ours is ours, and what\u2019s yours is yours.&nbsp.\nPlease let us know what you think about Twilio and our services.\nBy the way,

extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.\n(b) the Indemnifying Party will have the sole and exclusive authority to defend or settle any such Claim (provided that, the Indemnifying Party will obtain the Indemnified Party's consent in connection with any act or forbearance required by the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably

expense.\nThe Indemnified Party reserves the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of a Claim.\nNotwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party will not settle any Claims for which it has an obligation to indemnify pursuant to this Section 13 admitting liability or fault on behalf of the Indemnified Party, nor create any obligation on behalf of the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party\u2019s prior written consent.</p> 14.\nLimitation of Liability.\nEmergency Services <p>\n<em>Generally speaking, neither of us owes each other for any bad things that might indirectly result from our services not working as intended.\nHowever, each of us may owe the other for indirect damages for the claims covered under Section 13 (Mutual Indemnification) where we basically step into your shoes to defend a claim brought against you, or where you step into our shoes to defend a claim against us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Any direct damages we might owe each other cannot be more than the amount you\u2019ve paid (or should have paid) in the previous 12-months for the&nbsp.\ngiven Services giving rise to the claims.\nHowever, direct damages won\u2019t be limited if they result from your breach of Sections 5 (Customer Responsibilities, Restrictions and Requirements) or satisfying our mutual indemnification obligations.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We have special products and a special agreement that covers connecting to emergency services.\nIf you don\u2019t have that agreement with us, you may not use our services to connect to emergency services (like 911).\nIf something bad happens because you or someone using our services under your Twilio account(s) tries but is unable to reach emergency services, then Twilio is not and cannot be held responsible.</em>\n</p>\n<p>14.1 INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES.\nEXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER A PARTY'S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 13 (MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION) OF THESE TERMS, IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY REVENUES, GOODWILL, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, LOST DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF A PARTY\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.&nbsp.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.</p>\n<p>14.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\nEXCEPT FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM BREACH OF YOUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 5 (CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES, RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS) AND EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER A PARTY\u2019S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 13 (MUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION) OF THESE TERMS,&nbsp.\nIN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE.&nbsp.\nTHE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, BUT WILL NOT LIMIT YOUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 10 (FEES, PAYMENT TERMS, TAXES) ABOVE.</p>\n<p>14.3 &nbsp.\nEMERGENCY SERVICES DISCLAIMER.\n&nbsp.\nNEITHER TWILIO NOR ITS REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE, OR LOSS (AND CUSTOMER WILL HOLD TWILIO HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL SUCH CLAIMS) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES, AS DEFINED IN SECTION 5.2(b), ABOVE.&nbsp.\nTWILIO\u2019S OUTBOUND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR CONTACTING EMERGENCY

terms.</em>\n</p>\n<p>15.1 Term.\nThese Terms, as may be updated from time to time, will commence on the date they are accepted by you and continue until terminated in accordance with Section 15.2 (Termination) below (<em>\u201c</em>\n<strong>\n<em>Term</em>\n</strong>\n<em>\u201d</em>).</p>\n<p>15.2 Termination.\nEither party may terminate these Terms and close your customer account(s) for any

and fail to remedy that breach within five (5) days after providing written notice of that breach to us.</p> 16.\nSurvival <p>\n<em>Some terms live on even after these Terms of Service end.\nThat includes your payment obligations and Sections mentioned.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Upon termination of these Terms, your payment obligations, the terms of this Section 16, and the terms of the following

14 (Limitation of Liability.\nEmergency Services), Section 17 (General), and Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate).</p> 17.\nGeneral <p>\n<em>We both agree to follow the law, regulations, and statutes that apply to us.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Just because we don\u2019t enforce some part of these terms against you now doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t start enforcing them against you later.\nIf the

the&nbsp.\ncopyright-related issues to the online navigation bar.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.1 Compliance with Laws.\nYou will comply with the applicable law relating to your respective activities pursuant to these Terms.\nTwilio will provide the Services in accordance with laws&nbsp.\napplicable to Twilio\u2019s provision of the Services to its customers generally (i.e.\nwithout regard for Customer\u2019s particular use of the Services), and subject to Customer\u2019s use of the Services in accordance with this Agreement, the Documentation and&nbsp.\napplicable Order Form (if any).</p>\n<p>17.2 No Waiver, Order of Precedence.\nOur failure to enforce at any time any provision of these Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or any other of your obligations does not waive our right to do so later.\nAnd, if we do expressly waive any provision of these Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or any of your other obligations, that does not mean it is waived for all time in the future.\nAny waiver must be in writing and signed by you and us to be legally binding.\nIn the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence shall be (except as otherwise expressly set forth in an applicable Order Form): (1) &nbsp;the AUP, (2) product-specific terms, (3) the Terms of Service&nbsp.\nand (4) the Documentation.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>You cannot just transfer these terms or your obligations under these terms to someone else without our permission.\nWe can transfer these terms or our obligations under these terms without consent.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.3 Assignment.\nYou will not assign or otherwise transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent.\nAny attempt by you to assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms will be&nbsp.\nvoid.\nTwilio may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, without consent.\nSubject to this Section 17.3, these Terms will be binding on both you and Twilio and each of our successors and assigns.</p>\n<p>\n<em>These terms don\u2019t create any special relationship between us, like employer-employee, joint venture, or a partnership.\nNothing will change that.\nWe both will be responsible for our own employees.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.4 Relationship.\nYou and Twilio are independent contractors in the performance of each and every part of these Terms.\nNothing in these Terms is intended to create or shall be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship or a partnership, agency, joint venture, or franchise.\nYou and Twilio will be solely responsible for all of our respective employees and agents and our respective labor costs and expenses arising in connection with our respective employees and agents.\nYou and Twilio will also be solely responsible for any and all claims, liabilities or damages or debts of any type that may arise on account of each of our respective activities, or those of each of our respective employees or agents, in the performance of these Terms.\nNeither you nor Twilio has the authority to commit the other of us in any way and will not attempt to do so or imply that it has the right to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Except as explained in Section 18, if any part of these terms is not enforceable, the rest of the terms will still be enforceable.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.5 Severability.\nExcept as described in Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate), if any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and, in any event, the rest of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you need to notify us, you must

Counsel.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If one of us can\u2019t keep our promises because something crazy happens beyond our control (think earthquake, massive power outage, war), then that doesn\u2019t count as a breach of these terms.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.7 Force Majeure.\nNo failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of a party shall constitute an event of default or breach of these Terms to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control and without negligence of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil or military authority.\nfire.\nstrike, lockout or other labor dispute.\nflood, terrorist act.\nwar.\nriot.\ntheft.\nearthquake and other natural disaster.\nThe party affected by such cause shall take all reasonable actions to minimize the consequences of any such cause.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you\u2019re affiliated with a government entity, these terms still apply to your use of our services.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.8 Government Terms.\nWe provide the Services, including related software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with these Terms.\nIf you (or any of your End Users) are an agency, department, or other entity of any government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data, software, and manuals, is restricted by these Terms.\nAll other use is prohibited and no rights other than those provided in these Terms are conferred.\nThe Services were developed fully at private expense.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Other than arbitration (see the next section), if we can\u2019t agree on something and we end up having a legal dispute, then California laws will apply.\nWe definitely don\u2019t want to, but, if we have to go to court, then it will be in San Francisco, California.\nCourt isn\u2019t a great option, but at least we\u2019ll be in one of the best cities in the world!</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.9 Governing Law and Venue.\nThe enforceability and interpretation of Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be determined by the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions).\nApart from Section 18, these Terms will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws and principles that would cause laws of another jurisdiction to apply.\nThese Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\nExcept as provided in Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitration), any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services shall be instituted in either the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California, and we each consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is the only set of terms that governs our relationship.\nAny purchase order or other terms that you provide will not be binding or valid.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.10 Entire Agreement.\nExcept as provided in these Terms and any exhibits or addenda or other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms, these Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous proposals, statements, sales materials or presentations and agreements, oral and written.\nNo oral or written information or advice given by Twilio, its agents or employees will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the warranties or obligations under these Terms.\nAny purchase order document or similar document provided by you shall be construed solely as evidence of your internal business processes, and the terms and conditions contained thereon shall be void and have no effect with regard to these Terms between you and Twilio and be non-binding against Twilio even if signed by Twilio after the date you accept these Terms.</p> 18.\nAgreement to Arbitrate <p>\n<em>Please, please, please reach out to our Customer Support Team (they\u2019re amazing!) before bringing a legal case.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If our Customer Support Team can\u2019t help you with a dispute, then we both agree to go to binding arbitration, again, in San Francisco, California.\nArbitration means a professional arbitrator will decide how to resolve our dispute instead of a judge or a jury deciding the case.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Despite what we said above, there are some disputes that won\u2019t go to arbitration, but to court, like IP disputes and disputes about your violation of our Acceptable Use Policy.\nWe also don\u2019t have to arbitrate small claims court cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If we arbitrate, then we\u2019ll do it through the American Arbitration Association (AAA).\nBefore we even arbitrate, though, we\u2019ll try mediation with an AAA mediator.\nIf mediation doesn\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll go to arbitration through AAA with only one arbitrator (one is so much easier).\nAnd remember, the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final and binding.</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agreement to Arbitrate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support.\nMost disputes can be resolved that way.</p>\n<p>18.1 We Both Agree to Arbitrate.\nIf a dispute cannot be resolved through our Customer Support Team, you or any of your affiliates on one hand and Twilio and any of Twilio\u2019s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute relating to these Terms or in relation to the Services by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California.</p>\n<p>This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions below in Section 18.2 (Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate).\nIt also applies even after you have stopped using your customer account(s) or closed it.\nIf we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate), you understand that you and your affiliates and Twilio and its affiliates are giving up the right to have a judge and/or jury resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\n<p>18.2 Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou and your affiliates on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<blockquote>Your, your affiliates\u2019, Twilio\u2019s or Twilio\u2019s affiliates\u2019 intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents).\nor</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>Your violation of our Acceptable Use Policy .</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.\nIn addition, if any of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration).\nAny of us may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>\n<p>18.3 Details of Arbitration Procedure.\nPrior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between us by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties.\nIf mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA.\nYou can look at AAA\u2019s rules and procedures on their website http://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the <em>\"Rules\"</em>) and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules.\nTo the extent anything described in this Section 18 conflicts with the Rules, the language of this Section 18 applies.\nEach of us will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions.\nAll such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator.\nThis Section 18 does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim.\nThe award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award.\nThe arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.\nExcept as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties.\nJudgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<em>We both agree not to bring a class action suit against the other.\nIf for some reason a court decides that this term isn\u2019t enforceable, then this entire Section 18 will go away.</em>\n</p>\n<p>18.4 Class Action Waiver.\nBoth you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each other on an individual basis only.\nThat means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.\nThe arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).\nAnd, the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Twilio customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.\nIf a court decides that this Section 18.4 (Class Action Waiver) is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be null and void (i.e., go away).\nBut, the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p> 19.\nFun <p>\n<em>Let your imagination run wild with Twilio!</em>\n</p>\n<p>You understand and acknowledge that developing applications should be fun and easy, and by using the Services, you agree to let your imagination run wild.</p> 20.\nAdditional

Customers logging into our account portal come from and to detect possible fraud.</p>How We Treat Do Not Track Signals/California Do Not Track Disclosure<p>Various browsers allow a \u201cdo not track\u201d (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual\u2019s browser DNT setting.\nAt this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Twilio should interpret Do Not Track signals.\nTherefore, Twilio does not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device.\nTwilio does, however provide meaningful choices to you about the information that is collected through cookies and web beacons through the various opt-out options set forth above.\nWe will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.</p>How you contact us<p>You may contact via email at
