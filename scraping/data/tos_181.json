upload/download, post, use, copy or otherwise produce, transmit, distribute or store child pornography.\nSuspected violations of this prohibition may be reported to AT&amp;T at the following e-mail address: cp@abuse-att.net.\nAT&amp;T will report any discovered violation of this prohibition to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and take steps to remove child pornography (or otherwise block access to the content determined to contain child pornography) from its servers.</p> Spam/E-mail/Usenet Abuse:\n<p>Violation of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, or any other applicable law regulating e-mail services, constitutes a violation of this AUP.</p>\n<p>Spam/E-mail or Usenet abuse is prohibited using IP Services.\nExamples of Spam/E-mail or Usenet abuse include but are not limited to the following activities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sending multiple unsolicited electronic mail messages or \"mail-bombing\" \u2013 to one or more recipient;</li>\n<li>sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, or unsolicited electronic messages directed primarily at the advertising or promotion of products or services;</li>\n<li>sending unsolicited electronic messages with petitions for signatures or requests for charitable donations, or sending any chain mail related materials;</li>\n<li>sending bulk electronic messages without identifying, within the message, a reasonable means of opting out from receiving additional messages from the sender;</li>\n<li>sending electronic messages, files or other transmissions that exceed contracted for capacity or that create the potential for disruption of the AT&amp;T network or of the networks with which AT&amp;T interconnects, by virtue of quantity, size or otherwise;</li>\n<li>using another site's mail server to relay mail without the express permission of that site;</li>\n<li>using another computer, without authorization, to send multiple e-mail messages or to retransmit e-mail messages for the purpose of misleading recipients as to the

electronic messages;</li>\n<li>maintaining a site that is advertised via unsolicited electronic messages, regardless of the origin of the unsolicited electronic messages;</li>\n<li>sending messages that are harassing or malicious, or otherwise could reasonably be predicted to interfere with another party's quiet enjoyment of the IP Services or the Internet (e.g., through language, frequency, size or otherwise);</li>\n<li>using distribution lists containing addresses that include those who have opted out;</li>\n<li>sending electronic messages that do not accurately identify the sender, the sender's return address, the e-mail address of origin, or other information contained in the subject line or header;</li>\n<li>falsifying packet header, sender, or user information whether in whole or in part to mask the identity of the sender, originator or point of origin;</li>\n<li>using redirect links in unsolicited commercial e-mail to advertise a website or service;</li>\n<li>posting a message to more than ten (10) online forums or newsgroups, that could reasonably be expected to generate complaints;</li>\n<li>intercepting, redirecting or otherwise interfering or attempting to interfere with e-mail intended for third parties;</li>\n<li>knowingly deleting any author attributions, legal notices or proprietary designations or labels in a file that the user mails or sends;</li>\n<li>using, distributing, advertising, transmitting, or otherwise making available any software program, product, or service that is designed to violate this AUP or the AUP of any other Internet Service Provider, including, but not limited to, the facilitation of the means to spam.</li>\n</ul>\nSecurity Violations\n<p>Customers are responsible for ensuring and maintaining security of their systems and the machines that connect to and use IP Service(s), including implementation of necessary patches and operating system updates.</p>\n<p>IP Services may not be used to interfere with, gain unauthorized access to, or otherwise violate the security of AT&amp;T's (or another party's) server, network, network access, personal computer or control devices, software or data, or other system, or to attempt to do any of the foregoing.\nExamples of system or network security violations include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>unauthorized monitoring, scanning or probing of network or system or any other action aimed at the unauthorized interception of data or harvesting of e-mail addresses;</li>\n<li>hacking, attacking, gaining access to, breaching, circumventing or testing the vulnerability of the user authentication or security of any host, network, server, personal computer, network access and control devices, software or data without express authorization of the owner of the system or network;</li>\n<li>impersonating others or secretly or deceptively obtaining personal information of third parties (phishing, etc.);</li>\n<li>using any program, file, script, command or transmission of any message or content of any kind, designed to interfere with a terminal session, the access to or use of the Internet or any other means of communication;</li>\n<li>distributing or using tools designed to compromise security (including but not limited to SNMP tools), including cracking tools, password guessing programs, packet sniffers or network probing tools (except in the case of authorized legitimate network security operations);</li>\n<li>knowingly uploading or distributing files that contain viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots, corrupted files, root kits or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer, network system or other property, or be used to engage in modem or system hi-jacking;</li>\n<li>engaging in the transmission of pirated software;</li>\n<li>with respect to dial-up accounts, using any software or device designed to defeat system time-out limits or to allow Customer's account to stay logged on while Customer is not actively using the IP Services or using such account for the purpose of operating a server of any type;</li>\n<li>using manual or automated means to avoid any use limitations placed on the IP Services;</li>\n<li>providing guidance, information or assistance with respect to causing damage or security breach to AT&amp;T's network or systems, or to the network of any other IP Service provider;</li>\n<li>failure to take reasonable security precautions to help prevent violation(s) of this AUP.</li>\n</ul>\nCustomer Responsibilities\n<p>Customers remain solely and fully responsible for the content of any material posted, hosted, downloaded/uploaded, created, accessed or transmitted using the IP Services.\nAT&amp;T has no responsibility for any material created on the AT&amp;T's network or accessible using IP Services, including content provided on third-party websites linked to the AT&amp;T network.\nSuch third-party website links are provided as Internet navigation tools for informational purposes only, and do not constitute in any way an endorsement by AT&amp;T of the content(s) of such sites.</p>\n<p>Customers are responsible for taking prompt corrective action(s) to remedy a violation of AUP and to help prevent similar future violations.</p>\nAUP Enforcement and Notice\n<p>\n<b>Customer's failure to observe the guidelines set forth in this AUP may result in AT&amp;T taking actions anywhere from a warning to a suspension or termination of Customer's IP Services.</b> When feasible, AT&amp;T may provide Customer with a notice of an AUP violation via e-mail or otherwise allowing the Customer to promptly correct such violation.</p>\n<p>\n<b>AT&amp;T reserves the right, however, to act immediately and without notice to suspend or terminate affected IP Services in response to a court order or government notice that certain conduct must be stopped, or when AT&amp;T reasonably determines that the Customer's use of the affected IP Services may: (1) expose AT&amp;T to sanctions, prosecution, civil action or any other liability.\n(2) cause harm to or interfere with the integrity or normal operations of AT&amp;T's network or networks with which AT&amp;T is interconnected.\n(3) interfere with another AT&amp;T Customer's use of IP Services or the Internet.\n(4) violate any applicable law, rule or regulation.\nor (5) otherwise present an imminent risk of harm to AT&amp;T or AT&amp;T Customers.</b>\n</p>\nCopyright Infringement &amp.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act\n<p>AT&amp;T respects the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the \"DMCA\" found at 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512) provides that owners of copyrighted works who believe that their rights under U.S.\ncopyright law have been infringed may report alleged infringements to service providers like AT&amp;T.\nIn accordance with the DMCA and other applicable laws, AT&amp;T maintains a policy that provides for the termination of IP Services, under appropriate circumstances, if Customers are found to be a repeat infringer and/or if Customers' IP Services are used repeatedly for infringement (the \"Repeat Infringer Policy\").\nAT&amp;T may terminate IP Services at any time with or without notice to Customers.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T has no obligation to investigate possible copyright infringements with respect to materials transmitted by Customer or any other users of the IP Services.\nHowever, AT&amp;T will process valid notifications of claimed infringement under the DMCA, and continued receipt of infringement notifications for Customer's account will be used as a factor in determining whether Customer is a repeat infringer.\nIn addition, AT&amp;T may voluntarily participate, on terms acceptable to AT&amp;T, in copyright alert and graduated response programs.</p>\nIncident Reporting\n<p>Any complaints (other than claims of copyright infringement) regarding violation of this AUP by an AT&amp;T Customer (or its user) should be directed to abuse@att.net.\nWhere possible, include details that would assist AT&amp;T in investigating and resolving such complaint (e.g., expanded headers, IP address(s), a copy of the offending transmission and any log files).</p>\nDMCA Copyright Notifications:\n<p>Pursuant to 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 512(b)\u2013(d), a copyright holder may send AT&amp;T a valid notification of claimed copyright infringement under the DMCA.\nFor further information regarding such notifications, see https://www.att.com/legal/terms.dmca.html.\nAT&amp;T's designated agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement as described in DMCA subsection 512(c)(3) is:</p>\n<p>Registered Copyright Agent<br>\n4825 Creekstone Drive, Suite 300<br>\nDurham, NC 27703<br>\nE-mail: copyright@att.com</p>\n<p>Due to the substantial volume of notifications of claimed infringement that AT&amp;T receives and processes, we are unable to accept notices of alleged copyright infringement via this designated agent or email address other than notifications of claimed infringement sent pursuant to Sections 512(b)\u2013(d).</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T also provides transitory digital network communications services, pursuant to 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(a).\nIn connection with such services, AT&amp;T provides an online form that copyright holders should use to send notifications related to alleged copyright infringement by its users based on the standards of the Automated Copyright Notice System (ANCS).\nCopyright holders should use this online form to submit complaints related to alleged peer-to-peer file sharing (i.e.\nsharing media files via peer-to-peer networking technology), or other forms of copyright notice other than those sent pursuant to Sections 512(b)\u2013(d) of the DMCA (\"ISP Conduit Notices\").\nBy submitting complaints using this online form, we are able to more efficiently manage and process ISP Conduit Notices.\nDue to the substantial volume of copyright notices that AT&amp;T receives, we are unable to guarantee processing of ISP Conduit Notices that are sent by other means.\nCopyright holders can access AT&amp;T's online form at att.com/p2pnotices.\nPlease note that copyright holders must complete all fields in the online form before submitting.</p>\nContact Information:\n<p>Any notification that AT&amp;T sends to its Customers pursuant to this AUP will be sent via e-mail to the e-mail address on file with AT&amp;T, or may be in writing to Customer's address of record.\nIt is Customer's responsibility to promptly notify AT&amp;T of any change of contact information.</p>\n<p>Effective Date: July 28, 2017</p> ", "created_at":

Speed Tier page and the Broadband Information page are subject to periodic update without prior notice.</p>\n<p>Note: If the location to which your Service is provisioned is in a multi-tenant environment (e.g., an apartment building, condominium, private subdivision or retail shopping center, sometimes referred to herein as a \"MTU\"), provision of your Service may be subject to other terms and conditions imposed by the owner and/or manager of the MTU (e.g.\na landlord or home owner's association).\nYou will need to refer to the owner / manager of your particular MTU for more

of the change constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>\n2.\nInternet Service\na.\n<i>Service Description.</i>\n<p>Internet Service is composed of narrowband or broadband access to Internet, and offers you a capability for acquiring or retrieving information from.\ngenerating, storing, transforming, processing, or utilizing information on.\nor making available information to other Internet end points connected directly or indirectly to th AT&amp;T network.\nUnless otherwise specified, Internet Services from AT&amp;T include the following:</p>\n1) <i>Site Access / E-Mail Services</i>.\n<p>Access to att.net and related services, including e-mail, is generally included with your Internet Service.\nSuch access will be subject to the att.net Terms of Use found at https://www.att.com/legal/terms.attNetTermsOfUse.html.\nBy utilizing such access, including accessing the included e-mail account(s), you are agreeing to be bound by the terms thereof.</p> 2) <i>DNS Services / DNS Language Assist</i>.\n<p>Domain Name System (or DNS) services translate domain names into the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices within the underlying network protocols commonly used to organize the internet.\nThe DNS Services include DNS Language Assist, which upon entry of an incomplete or inaccurate Web address will automatically search for similar or related terms and present you with suggested sites you may want to reach instead of providing only an error message.\nIf you prefer to opt out of DNS Language Assist, you may do so by visiting att.com/cmpchoice from your desktop or from your mobile Web browser.</p> 3) <i>IP Addresses</i>.\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, AT&amp;T Internet Service is provided with a dynamic Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, a static IP address, a multiple static IP address service (as applicable), or a privately managed IP address utilizing CGN (Carrier Gateway NAT) technology, at the sole discretion of AT&amp;T.\nStatic IP addresses are not available with all Internet Services or all tiers within certain Internet Services.&nbsp.\nUnless otherwise specified, a dynamic IP address is a single Internet address intended for use with a single Member Account and any associated Sub Accounts and a static IP address or multiple static IP address is intended for use with a single computer or a network of devices, computers and/or servers.\nYou may not use the Service in a manner that is inconsistent with these intended uses.\nUnless otherwise specified, AT&amp;T Internet services will support both IPV6 and IPV4 Internet addresses.\nhowever, to reach IPv6-exclusive Internet content, some of your equipment may require upgrades or replacement.\nFor more information about IPv6 and how it affects you, visit att.com/ipv6.</p> 4) <i>Interconnection</i>.\n<p>Because the Internet consists of multiple interconnected networks and most Internet end points (for example, Web sites and other content providers) are not directly connected to the AT&amp;T network, AT&amp;T must connect to and exchange traffic with other networks to provide its subscribers the capability of uploading data to or downloading data from Internet end points that are connected to those networks.\nTo that end, AT&amp;T has entered into commercially negotiated agreements to exchange traffic with such networks on mutually agreeable terms.\nConsistent with its longstanding practice, AT&amp;T does not warrant that it will establish or expand the connections between its network and other networks except on such mutually agreeable terms.\nTo the extent AT&amp;T is unable to reach agreement on terms of interconnection or network expansion with these other networks, it could affect your service.\nThese impacts on your service performance are described in more detail in the AT&amp;T Open Internet Notice.\nAT&amp;T therefore makes no promise, express or implied, that you will be able to upload data to or download data from Internet end points connected to other networks at any particular speed.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Like the other networks that make up the Internet, the AT&amp;T network is a shared network, which means that the transmission links and other network resources used to provide the Service are shared among the subscribers of AT&amp;T.\nAT&amp;T manages this network for the benefit of all users based on a variety of factors, and our technical expertise.</p> b.\n<i>\"Speed\" of Internet Services, Technology and Data Usage.</i>\n<p>AT&amp;T offers many broadband internet access service options, each of which has a specific service capability speed range.\nThe term \"speed\" is commonly used as a shorthand way to describe the capacity at which a particular broadband internet access service can transmit data.\nThis capacity is typically measured in the number of kilobits, megabits, or gigabits that can be transmitted in one second (Kbps, Mbps, or Gbps).\nSome applications like a short email without attachments or basic Web browsing do not require high service capability speeds to function optimally, while other activities like transferring large data files can be performed faster with higher-speed services.\nYour service capability speed may not be suitable for some applications, particularly those involving real-time or near real-time, high-bandwidth uses such as streaming video or video conferencing.<br>\n</p> 1) <i>AT&amp;T Speed Tiers Page.</i>\n<p>The current fixed broadband internet access speed tiers AT&amp;T offers may be found on AT&amp;T's Speed Tier page at att.net/speedtiers, which identifies the \"Expected Speeds\" of the downstream and upstream rates at which your \"Connection\" (as those terms are defined below) transfers internet access data between the network interface device at your home, office, or apartment building to the point you connect to the AT&amp;T network.\nBecause many different factors can affect the performance of broadband internet access service delivered to a particular location or individual, AT&amp;T does not guarantee specific performance levels for broadband internet access services.\nInstead, AT&amp;T manages its network to provide overall median performance consistent with the Expected Speeds.<br>\n</p> 2) <i>Defined Terms.</i>\n&nbsp.\n<i>\n<br>\na)<b> \"Connection.\"</b>\n</i>\n<p>Because service performance varies on an end-to-end basis, the service capability speeds of AT&amp;T are limited to, and measured between, the equipment utilized to provision your Internet Service at the fixed address or location you identified when ordering the Internet Service and a point on the AT&amp;T network, sometimes referred to as the \"Connection\" or your \"internet connection.\"&nbsp.\nThe Connection constitutes only one segment of the end-to-end transmission path connecting the end user to Internet Web sites or content providers.</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<br>\nb) <b>\"Expected Speeds.\"</b>\n</i>Because there are many factors which may impact the speed experienced by any particular internet user at any particular time (as described in more detail below), the \"Expected Speed\" represents an anticipated, theoretical speed of the Connection, based on network design and engineering, measured over time.&nbsp.\nAt any moment in time, a particular observed speed will vary from the Expected Speed.\nHowever, AT&amp;T manages its network toward an overall median speed consistent with the Expected Speed.<br>\n</p> 3) <i>Technology</i>.\n<p>Unless otherwise expressly agreed to the contrary, AT&amp;T makes no warranty with regard to the technology used to provision any particular Internet Service.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding any description that may be furnished for a particular Internet Service, AT&amp;T reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to the technology used to provision all or any portion of any Internet Service.&nbsp.\nSo long as the essential functionality of the Internet Service from a user perspective is not negatively impacted in a material way by any change in technology, AT&amp;T has no obligation to notify you of any changes in technology and changes in technology will not affect your rights or obligations with respect to the Internet Service you have purchased.<br>\n</p>\n<p>For any particular Internet Service, the technology utilized to provision different portions of the Service may vary significantly.&nbsp.\nIn those circumstance, and unless otherwise expressly agreed to the contrary, AT&amp;T shall only be responsible for the technology utilized to provision the Connection.&nbsp.\nAs discussed in further detail below, AT&amp;T has no control over, and makes no warranties with respect to, the technology within the premises to which the Internet Service is provisioned (e.g.\nthe inside wiring, local Wi-Fi, home network and/or local access network).&nbsp.\nAT&amp;T further has no control over and makes no warranties with respect to the technology utilized by content providers for purposes of operating the servers which an end user must access in order to receive access to the content.<br>\n</p> 4) <i>Other Factors that Impact Speed.</i>\n<p>In addition to issues presented by the various technologies over which an internet access may operate on an end-to end basis, end-to-end performance of your Internet Service will also depend on a variety of other factors, including (but not limited to): the number of subscribers simultaneously using the network.\nspecific characteristics of the location from which you are accessing the internet.\nspecific characteristics of your intended destination on the internet.\noverall traffic on the Internet.\nWi-Fi connectivity.\ninterference with high frequency spectrum on your telephone line.\nwiring inside your premises, office or apartment complex.\nthe capacity or performance of your network devices, routers, gateways or modems.\nthe servers with which you must communicate with in order to reach your intended destination and/or access the content you are trying to access.\ninternal and external network management factors (including Overhead, which refers to the various control and signaling data required to achieve the reliable transmission of Internet access data).\nand, the networks you and others are using when communicating.\nIn addition, your use of other AT&amp;T services (such as U-verse TV, AT&amp;T Phone, Unified Messaging, and other services) that may share the capacity of your broadband connection with the Service may impact the amount of capacity available for your use of the Service at that particular time and thus affect the performance of the Service.\nConsequently, AT&amp;T does not guarantee the performance of your service on an end- to-end basis.&nbsp.\nThis is also why third party speed tests which include other portions of the overall internet connection beyond the Connection itself may yield results which are outside the expected speed range for your particular service plan on the Speed Tier page.&nbsp.\nAT&amp;T expressly disclaims any warranty with respect to the outcome of these third party speed tests.<br>\n</p> 5) <i>Download vs Upload Speeds.</i>\n<p>The term \"download\" generally refers to the process of a user utilizing their local device or computer to access information stored on a remote device, computer or server connected to the internet and includes activities ranging from \"surfing\" the internet, to downloading a file to streaming video.&nbsp.\nThe term \"upload\" generally refers to the process of a user sending information from their device or computer to a remote device, computer or server connected to the internet.&nbsp.\nUnless otherwise specified, references to the \"speed\" of an Internet Service will solely be with respect to the download speed of that Service.&nbsp.\nSimilarly, unless otherwise specified, AT&amp;T makes no guarantee that the upload speed of a particular Internet Service will be the same as the download speed, either in terms of the applicable speed range or in terms of actual performance at any given moment.&nbsp.\nIn fact, as set forth on the Speed Tier Page, many Internet Services have expected upload speeds which are lower than the comparable expected download speeds.&nbsp.\nAs a result, and as a result of the many other factors that might affect speed at any given moment, the actual upload and download speed of any Internet Service will vary greatly from time to time and day to day.<br>\n</p> 6) <i>Data Usage on Residential Internet Services.</i>\n<p>The residential Internet Service you purchased includes either an unlimited data allowance or a monthly data usage allowance with overage charges for usage in excess of your allowance.&nbsp.\nMore details regarding the applicable data allowance is set forth in the Customer Service Summary or Order Confirmation Letter you received.&nbsp.\nUse of certain services, including but not limited to digital TV features and apps, AT&amp;T Digital Life, home security, home automation and medical alarm systems, whether provided by AT&amp;T or a third party, may count towards your Internet data usage allowance.\nFor additional information about the use of your residential AT&amp;T Internet Service, including management of your data usage, as well as information about other data plans that you might consider, please refer too https://www.att.com/internet-usage.\n(This paragraph is not applicable to Business Internet Services.)</p> c.\nAvailability and Service Changes.\n1) <i>Availability.</i>\n<p>AT&amp;T Internet Services are not available in all areas and may not be available at certain speed tiers (or at all) at your location, even if our initial testing, an AT&amp;T website and/or any sales representative or other personnel associated with AT&amp;T indicated that your location qualified for a particular speed tier or Service.&nbsp.\nIf your location is situated in an MTU, availability of any particular Internet Service may depend upon the owner and/or manager of the MTU agreeing to grant AT&amp;T access to the MTU and/or to your particular location.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The availability of any Internet Service may also be subject to various limitations upon the capacity of the various technologies utilized in AT&amp;T's network to support a given number of customers on any particular Internet Service and/or speed tier in a given area (\"Capacity Limitations\").&nbsp.\nSome Internet Services are more likely to be subject to Capacity Limitations.&nbsp.\nWhen a particular part of AT&amp;T's network is approaching a Capacity Limitation, it can be very difficult for AT&amp;T to predict exactly when or how that Capacity Limitation will impact upon the availability of a particular Internet Service to a particular location.&nbsp.\nThis may mean that, although a certain location may be theoretically capable of receiving the Internet Service in question, Capacity Limitations at the time a particular order is placed may mean that a particular Service is not available to a particular location.&nbsp.\nThis can even occur between the time that a Service is ordered and the time that the Services is installed / fulfilled, resulting in a Service that was shown as being available to a particular location at the time an order was placed no longer being available at the time of installation.&nbsp.\nAs discussed in Section 5 below, Capacity Limitations may also mean that if a Service is terminated at any location for any reason whatsoever, it may not be possible to restore or renew that Service at that location.&nbsp.\nFor all those reasons, AT&amp;T makes absolutely no guarantee as to the availability of any Internet Service at any location.<br>\n</p> 2) <i>Service Changes.</i>\n<p>AT&amp;T reserves the right to modify or discontinue any Internet Service (including rates and charges), temporarily or permanently.\nIf AT&amp;T makes a change that would have a material impact on your Service, AT&amp;T will endeavor to provide you with reasonable notice of any such change.\nThe terms and conditions for temporary changes, if any, will be included in the notice and incorporated by reference into this Agreement at: att.com/temporaryterms.\nYour continued subscription to the Service after the effective date of the change constitutes your acceptance of the changes and the associated terms and conditions.\nIn lieu of notice and Web site posting, AT&amp;T may instead, at its sole discretion, require customers to enter into an agreement with AT&amp;T regarding temporary material changes.</p> 3) <i>Technology Conversions.</i>\n<p>In the event that AT&amp;T determines to provision Internet Service at your location utilizing a different technology, we will evaluate whether the conversion can occur without significant interruption to your service, generally defined as no noticeable interruptions during normal business hours and no single interruption outside of normal business hours of more than one (1) hour in length.&nbsp.\nIf we determine that the conversion can be accomplished without significant interruption in your service, we may elect to proceed with the conversion without prior notice to you.&nbsp.\nIf we determine that the conversion is likely to result in a significant interruption in your service, we will endeavor to provide you with at least thirty (30) days' notice of any anticipated significant interruptions of your service via email, direct mail, bill page message, and/or bill insert.\nIf, due to factors outside our control, we cannot provide you with thirty (30) days' notice, we will endeavor to provide you with as much advanced notice as circumstances reasonably allow.&nbsp.\nFollowing the period identified in such notice, we may at our sole discretion, either disconnect your service or temporarily suspend your service for up to fifteen (15) days to facilitate the conversion process.<br>\n</p>\n<p>As part of any conversion, we may, in our discretion, discontinue the particular Internet Service you are currently receiving and make available to you an alternate Internet Service of comparable or better Speed at the then applicable rates, terms, and conditions, which may differ from your previous Internet Service rates, terms, and conditions (including Bundle Discounts).\nIf you are on a Term Plan and your overall price will increase as a result of this conversion, taking into account all applicable credits and discounts, you will not have to pay any applicable Early Termination Fee if you elect to cancel your Internet Service within the period specified for doing so on your updated Customer Service Summary or Confirmation Letter.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Your new Internet Service may require different or additional equipment in order to fully utilize.&nbsp.\nIf that proves to be the case, we will endeavor to either provide you with the required equipment or notify you of any equipment you will be required to provide on your own.&nbsp.\nYou may also be required to review and accept new or additional terms and conditions related to the new Internet Service and/or new equipment.&nbsp.\nIf that proves to be the case, your acceptance of such terms and conditions will be a condition to your ability to access and utilize the new Internet Service.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>d.\nHome Networking / Home Wi-Fi.</b> (These provisions apply to consumers.\nBusiness customers should refer to Schedule 6 for provisions applicable to Business Services.)</p>\n1) <i>Inside Wiring.</i>\n<p>When ordering AT&amp;T Internet Service, you will be responsible for providing any Inside Wiring (IW) in the form of copper wire or fiber optic cable between the AT&amp;T network termination interface at your location and the gateway equipment that will located at your premises.\nIn most cases, the IW will already be present in your existing locations, however you will be responsible for providing any additional IW which may be required.&nbsp.\nIf additional IW is required, you may have the option of ordering IW from AT&amp;T or installing your own IW.\nIf you elect to install your own IW, the IW must be installed and available for use by AT&amp;T Technicians before you order AT&amp;T Internet Service.\nIf IW service is ordered from AT&amp;T, it is your sole responsibility to obtain landlord permission or approvals for such IW.<br>\n</p> 2) <i>Disclaimer of Warranties.</i>\n<p>The condition of the IW over which your Internet Service is transmitted within your premises will impact the performance of the Internet Service, including with respect to speed, reliability and latency.&nbsp.\nYou are solely responsible for the condition of any IW and AT&amp;T expressly disclaims any responsibility thereto.&nbsp.\nIf IW is provided by AT&amp;T, upon completion of installation you will have full ownership and responsibility for such IW.\n<b>Unless expressly agreed in writing to the contrary, AT&amp;T makes no warranty to you or any other party for any work or materials constituting or associated with any inside wire.\nAT&amp;T expressly disclaims any warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular use, and AT&amp;T has no responsibility to maintain, update, repair, replace, de-install, or remove any installed inside wire.</b>\n</p> 3) Home Wi-Fi.\n<p>Depending upon the Internet Service you purchase, your Internet Service may include Wi-Fi enabled home networking equipment (\"Wi-Fi Equipment\") in order to help you allow Wi-Fi enabled devices to wirelessly connect to your Internet Service (\"Home Wi-Fi\").&nbsp.\n(See the Applicable Schedule for details about what kind of Wi-Fi networking equipment many be included with the particular Internet Service you are purchasing.)<br>\n</p>\n<p>In order to use Home Wi-Fi, you must have Wi-Fi enabled devices that (a) meet U.S.\nand WiFi Alliance standards.\n(b) are compatible with the Wi-Fi network being generated by the applicable Wi-Fi Equipment.\nand (c) are capable of running IP and related protocols.&nbsp.\nThe Wi-Fi enabled device you are utilizing must be in close enough proximity to the Wi-Fi Equipment to achieve connectivity with the Home Wi-Fi.&nbsp.\nActual Home Wi-Fi coverage and quality may vary depending upon the location of the Wi-Fi Equipment, the location of the applicable Wi-Fi enabled device and conditions in and around the premises in which both the Equipment and the Wi-Fi enabled device operate.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Home Wi-Fi is designed to provide you with the highest speed available from your home network at any given point in time, subject to the many different factors that can affect network performance.\nAT&amp;T's most recent generation of Wi-Fi Equipment generally supports the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standard, although older Home Wi-Fi Equipment may only support the IEEE 802.11b or IEEE 80.11b/g standards.\nThe theoretical maximum speed you may be capable of achieving from your Home Wi-Fi will depend heavily on which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the Wi-Fi Equipment you have as well as which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the particular device you are utilizing.&nbsp.\n(By way of example only, IEEE 802.11b offers a theoretical maximum of 11 Mbps while IEEE 802.11n offers a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps.&nbsp.\nEven if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11n, if you are utilizing an older device that is only capable of supporting the older IEEE 802.11b standard your theoretical maximum speed will be limited to 11 Mbps.)<br>\n</p>\n<p>Although the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards have theoretical maximum speeds ranging from over ten Mbps to over a gigabit per second, depending on which standard applies, actual Wi-Fi speeds will be substantially lower than the theoretical maximum speeds which describe the physical throughput rate including Wi-Fi protocol communications.&nbsp.\nThe result is that the maximum you can receive may not exceed 40%-50% of the theoretical maximum Wi-Fi standard speed and may be significantly lower depending on other applicable factors.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, the actual speed you experience over Wi-Fi will depend in part on the speed of the connection between the Wi-Fi network you are accessing and the destination you want to reach on the Internet, which may be significantly below the theoretical maximum speed of the service.&nbsp.\n(By way of example only, if you order AT&amp;T Internet 25, with a download Expected Speed of 25 Mbps according to the AT&amp;T Speed Tier page, even if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location and the device you are utilizing are both capable of supporting the IEEE 802.11n standard with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbps, the theoretical maximum internet download speed with your device connected to your Home Wi-Fi will not exceed 25 Mbps.)<br>\n<br>\n</p> 4) Home Network Management.\n<p>Although AT&amp;T reserves the right to manage any equipment used to access any Internet Service, you are solely responsible for all security measures over your in-home network, including any IW, local area network(s) and/or Wi-Fi Equipment.&nbsp.\nThat includes, but is not limited to, access to authorization codes or passwords, as well as any encryption you deem necessary or required.&nbsp.\nAT&amp;T may provide you with tools or software to assist you in managing one or more aspects of your home network (which software would then be included in the term \"Software\" as used herein below), but you remain solely responsible for all aspects of your home network, including any activity by children or other guests that you may allow (either intentionally or unintentionally, through lack of adequate security measures) to access your Internet Services via your home network and/or Home Wi-Fi.&nbsp.\nFor that reason, AT&amp;T recommends that you take all necessary measures to ensure adequate network security and to closely monitor use of your Internet Services and your home network by anyone accessing your home network, especially children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n</p> e.\n<i>Nationwide Wi-Fi Hot Spots (For Internet).</i>\n<p>Access to AT&amp;T's nationwide network of Wi-Fi Hot Spots may be available to you as part of the Service, and the AT&amp;T Wi-Fi Hot Spots will provide you with access to the Internet via certain AT&amp;T Internet access points (Locations).\nPrimarily, this access is provided via a Wi-Fi network using an IEEE 802.11 standard.\nTo access the Wi-Fi Hot Spots, you must have a device that is compatible with the specific Wi-Fi equipment deployed at a Location.\nAccess to the Hot Spots is intended for the limited purposes of assisting with access to the public Internet for email and Web browsing or other purposes consistent with the AT&amp;T Wi-Fi Terms of Service, which may be found at att.com/legal/terms.wiFiServices.html.\nIn order to gain access to the Internet at a Location, You may need your Member account information including your Member ID.\nIf you are also an AT&amp;T Mobility customer, you may auto- authenticate at certain Locations without the use of your Member ID.\nThe AT&amp;T Wi-Fi Terms of Service will govern your use of AT&amp;T Wi-Fi Hot Spots.</p> 3.\nRegistration and Membership\na.\n<i>Member Account.</i>\n<p>When you complete the registration process for the Service, you become the \"Member Account\" holder.\nTo be a Member Account holder you must either be: (i) 18 years or older, if an individual, or, (ii) be a corporation, partnership, or other legal entity duly formed (and incorporated if applicable) in good standing where required to do business with all legal authority and power to accept this Agreement and acting through your duly authorized representative.\nYou will be asked to choose a unique \"Member ID\" for your account.<br>\n</p>\nb.\n<i>Sub Accounts.</i>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, Member Account holders may also create up to ten accounts with separate login credentials that are linked to the Member Account (each a \"Sub Account\").\nEach Sub Account will also be required to accept this Agreement and complete the Sub Account registration.<br>\n</p> c.\n<i>Member Account Responsibility.</i>\n<p>The Member Account holder is responsible for all activity associated with the Member Account and any of its Sub Accounts, including all fees and charges, whether the charges are incurred by the Member Account or the Sub Accounts.\nUse of Member ID subjects you to the AT&amp;T Access ID Terms and Conditions (available at att.com/accessidterms), which

must be provided to engage in most online or telephonically enabled account management functions.\nYou agree to immediately notify AT&amp;T if your password or passcode has been compromised and/or you wish to remove an authorized user from your account.\nin the absence of such notification, you are responsible for activities on your Member Account, including by persons listed as authorized users.<br>\n</p> 4.\nPricing\na.\n<i>Term Plans, Bundle Discounts.</i>\n<p>When you purchased the Service, you agreed to a specific price and plan, which may have included a term for the Service of one or more years (\"Term Plan\").\nSimilarly, some plans may offer a discount on the Service if you sign up for other AT&amp;T services (\"Bundle Discount\").\nYou agree to maintain your Service and any bundled services for the applicable term of the Term Plan or Bundle Discount, as applicable.\nIf you signed up for a Term Plan or a Bundle Discount, the price under the applicable plans is valid until one of the following events occurs, at which time the price of your Service may revert to the then-existing price for such Service: (1) the term of your plan expires.\n(2) you change your current Service address to another Service address.\n(3) you drop one of the AT&amp;T services that you were required to purchase to receive the special rate.\nor (4) AT&amp;T exercises a right under this Agreement to terminate your Member Account's (or any associated Sub Account's or Authorized User's) use of the Service.<br>\n</p> 5.\nTermination or Cancellation of Service\na.\n<i>Your Decision to Terminate or Continue Service.</i>\n<p>You may cancel your Service, but if you do so before the end of any applicable term, you will be subject to&nbsp.\nany early termination fee which may be associated with that plan as specified in your Customer Service Summary, your Order Confirmation Letter or the applicable Fee Schedule(s) (referred to as an \"Early Termination Fee\" or \"ETF\").&nbsp.\nAt the conclusion of your term, or at all times if you did not agree to a Term Plan, your continued Service will be provided on a month-to-month basis.\nRegardless of whether you are subject to any applicable term or have Service on a month-to-month basis, if you cancel Service prior to the end of your billing cycle, your Service cancellation will be effective as of the final day of your billing cycle for billing purposes.&nbsp.\nYou will not receive a refund or prorated credit of any portion of Service if you cancel prior to the end of your billing cycle.&nbsp.\nIf you elect to continue Service on a month-to-month basis, you should review the then current Agreement regularly at att.com/internet-terms.&nbsp.\nThe then current Agreement will govern your Service.&nbsp.\nYour election to continue Service represents your agreement to the then current Agreement.</p> b.\n<i>Service Suspension/Termination by AT&amp;T.</i>\n<p>AT&amp;T may immediately terminate or suspend your Member Account and Sub Accounts, and all or a portion of your Service without notice for any of the reasons set forth in AT&amp;T's Acceptable Use Policy, or if: (a) you provide false or inaccurate information to AT&amp;T.\n(b) you (or anyone you permit to utilize the Service, including a Sub Account associated with your Member ID) violate this Agreement or the AT&amp;T Acceptable Use Policy.\n(c) you (or anyone you permit to utilize the Service, including a Sub Account associated with your Member ID) engage in conduct that is a violation of any law, regulation or tariff

services pursuant to 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(a).&nbsp.\nUnder the program, content owners may submit notifications to AT&amp;T of alleged copyright infringement based on information they have independently collected by joining peer-to-peer networks, in accordance with the industry standard Automated Copyright Notice System.\nAT&amp;T then will attempt to identify a subscriber account if the content owner has detected an IP address utilized by an AT&amp;T subscriber and forward a copyright alert to the subscriber account, advising the account holder of the allegation and providing information about online copyright infringement.\nIf a subscriber receives additional alerts, we may temporarily redirect the account holder's broadband Internet access service to a webpage where the account holder must review material on the importance of copyright and the lawful use of content available over the Internet.\nUpon completion of this review, such redirection will be discontinued and the subscriber\u2019s service will be restored to normal.\nAfter this stage, if a subscriber continues to receive additional alerts, AT&amp;T may take further action consistent with 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(i), which may ultimately result in termination of the subscriber/accountholder\u2019s broadband Internet access service.\nAccount holders\u2019 personally identifiable information is protected

WITH AT&amp;T BY BINDING ARBITRATION\n<p>\n<b>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Consumer Customers: See Arbitration sections below.\nBusiness Customers: See Schedule 6.</p>\n<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 800.288.2020.\n<b>In the unlikely event that the AT&amp;T customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</b> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n<b>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration.\nMoreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p>\n<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>\n<u>Arbitration Agreement</u>\n</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims</b> between you and AT&amp;T.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to:<ul>\n<li>Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising)<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>References to \"AT&amp;T,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Service under this or prior Agreements between us.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\n<b>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND AT&amp;T ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</b> This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").\nThe Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 (\"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled.<br>\n<b>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration from here: att.com/arbitration-forms.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000.\n(The filing fee currently is $200, but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address).\nThe arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.\n(You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.\nUnless AT&amp;T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.<p>Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nIn addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of the last written settlement offer made by AT&amp;T before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay you the greater of the award or $10,000 (\"the alternative payment\"), whichever is greater.\nand</li>\n<li>Pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.<br>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>The right to attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.\nHowever, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys\u2019 fees or costs.\nAlthough under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\n<b>YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</b>.\nFurther, unless both you and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during the period of time that you are receiving Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.<br>\n</li>\n</ol>\n14.\nSoftware - End User License Agreement\n<p>If you have connected to the Service by downloading or installing software made available by AT&amp;T, either directly or

the AT&amp;T network termination interface at your building and the gateway equipment located at the customer premises.\nYou may have the option of requesting IW from AT&amp;T or installing your own IW.\nIf you elect to install your own IW, the IW must be installed and available for use by AT&amp;T Technicians before you order AT&amp;T Internet Service.\nIf inside wire service is requested from

AND AT&amp;T HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY TO MAINTAIN, UPDATE, REPAIR, REPLACE, DE-INSTALL, OR REMOVE ANY INSTALLED INSIDE WIRE.</b>\n<br>\n</p> 3.\nLocal Wi-Fi.\n<p>Depending upon the Internet Service you purchase, your Internet Service may include Wi-Fi enabled local area networking equipment (\"Wi-Fi Equipment\") in order to help you allow Wi-Fi enabled devices to wirelessly connect to your Internet Service (\"Local Wi-Fi\").&nbsp.\n(See the Applicable Schedule for details about what kind of Wi-Fi networking equipment many be included with the particular Internet Service you are purchasing.)<br>\n</p>\n<p>In order to use Local Wi-Fi, you must have Wi-Fi enabled devices that (a) meet U.S.\nand WiFi Alliance standards.\n(b) are compatible with the Wi-Fi network being generated by the applicable Wi-Fi Equipment.\nand (c) are capable of running IP and related protocols.&nbsp.\nThe Wi-Fi enabled device you are utilizing must be in close enough proximity to the Wi-Fi Equipment to achieve connectivity with the Local Wi-Fi.&nbsp.\nActual Local Wi-Fi coverage and quality may vary depending upon the location of the Wi-Fi Equipment, the location of the applicable Wi-Fi enabled device and conditions in and around the premises in which both the Equipment and the Wi-Fi enabled device operate.</p>\n<p>Local Wi-Fi is designed to provide you with the highest speed available from the network at any given point in time, subject to the many different factors that can affect network performance.\nAT&amp;T\u2019s most recent generation of Wi-Fi Equipment generally supports the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standard, although older Wi-Fi Equipment may only support the IEEE 802.11b or IEEE 80.11b/g standards.\nThe theoretical maximum speed you may be capable of achieving from your Home Wi-Fi will depend heavily on which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the Wi-Fi Equipment you have as well as which IEEE 802.11 standard is supported by the particular device you are utilizing.&nbsp.\n(By way of example only, IEEE 802.11b offers a theoretical maximum of 11 Mbps while IEEE 802.11n offers a theoretical maximum of 600 Mbps.&nbsp.\nEven if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location is capable of supporting IEEE 802.11n, if you are utilizing an older device that is only capable of supporting the older IEEE 802.11b standard your theoretical maximum speed will be limited to 11 Mbps.)</p>\n<p>Although the IEEE 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac standards have theoretical maximum speeds ranging from over ten Mbps to over a gigabit per second, depending on which standard applies, actual Wi-Fi speeds will be substantially lower than the theoretical maximum speeds which describe the physical throughput rate including Wi-Fi protocol communications.&nbsp.\nThe result is that the maximum you can receive may not exceed 40%-50% of the theoretical maximum Wi-Fi standard speed and may be significantly lower depending on other applicable factors.\nIn addition to the factors discussed above, the actual speed you experience over Wi-Fi will depend in part on the speed of the connection between the Wi-Fi network you are accessing and the destination you want to reach on the Internet, which may be significantly below the theoretical maximum speed of the service.&nbsp.\n(By way of example only, if you order AT&amp;T Internet 25, with a download speed range of between 15 Mbps and 25 Mbps according to the AT&amp;T Speed Tier page, even if the Wi-Fi Equipment at your location and the device you are utilizing are both capable of supporting the IEEE 802.11n standard with a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbps, the theoretical maximum internet download speed with your device connected to your Local Wi-Fi will never exceed 25 Mbps.)<br>\n</p> 4.\nLocal Area Network Management.\n<p>Although AT&amp;T reserves the right to manage any equipment used to access any Internet Service, you are solely responsible for all security measures over your internal network, including any IW, local area network(s) and/or Wi-Fi Equipment.&nbsp.\nThat includes, but is not limited to, access to authorization codes or passwords, as well as any encryption you deem necessary or required.&nbsp.\nAT&amp;T may provide you with tools or software to assist you in managing one or more aspects of your internal network (which software would then be included in the term \"Software\" as used herein below), but you remain solely responsible for all aspects of your network, including any activity by employees, customers or other guests that you may allow (either intentionally or unintentionally, through lack of adequate security measures) to access your Internet Services via your local area network and/or Local Wi-Fi.&nbsp.\nFor that reason, AT&amp;T recommends that you take all necessary measures to ensure adequate network security and to closely monitor use of your Internet Services and your local network by anyone accessing your network.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n</p>

of such cancellation or termination, plus any third-party charges resulting from the cancelation or termination.<br>\n</p> 7.\n<i>Arbitration Agreement:</i>\n<p>AT&amp;T and you (\"We\") agree to resolve all disputes between us through binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, as modified by this provision.</p>\n<p>This agreement to arbitrate is broad, and includes disputes of any type between AT&amp;T (including its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, predecessors, successors, and assigns) and you (including authorized or unauthorized users/beneficiaries of services or devices) under this or prior agreements.\n<b>We agree that WE are waiving the right to a trial by jury, to participate in a class action, or to seek remedies beyond the extent necessary to provide individualized relief to, and affecting only, AT&amp;T or You alone.\nWE AGREE NOT TO ACT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED OR DE FACTO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC.</b> Except for matters relating to arbitrability or to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision or the interpretation of the limitations on class, representative, private attorney general, and non-individualized relief, all issues are for the arbitrator to decide.</p>\n<p>A party seeking arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").\nNotice to AT&amp;T must be addressed to: Office of Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 (\"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the basis of the claim or dispute.\n(b) describe the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nand, (c) provide your AT&amp;T account number.\nIf We do not resolve the claim within 30 days after receipt of the Notice, either of us may commence an arbitration.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount of any award on the merits.</p>\n<p>Unless We agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county of your billing address.\nAT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for a claim brought by AT&amp;T or for a claim or Demand valued at up to $25,000 brought by You.\nIf the arbitrator finds that your claim or Demand is frivolous or is brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of fees will be governed by the AAA rules and You agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for fees already paid by AT&amp;T that are your obligation under the AAA rules.</p>\n<p>If you complied with the notice procedures above.\nthe value of your claim or Demand is $25,000 or less.\nand the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than the value of AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or any amount if AT&amp;T made no offer), AT&amp;T will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pay you the award or $10,000, whichever is greater (\"Alternative Payment\").\nand</li>\n<li>Pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorneys' fees and expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"Attorney Award\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The arbitrator may rule on the payment of fees, expenses, and the Alternative Payment and Attorney Award during the proceeding and within 14 days after his/her final ruling on the merits.\nIn assessing whether the award is greater than the value of the last written settlement offer by AT&amp;T, the arbitrator may consider only those attorneys' fees or expenses that you incurred through the date of your Notice and which had been awarded to You.\nYou may also recover attorneys' fees and expenses under applicable law, but you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or expenses.</p>\n<p>This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and the Federal Arbitration Act governs.\nThis arbitration provision survives termination of this Agreement.\nAs the exclusive alternative to arbitration, AT&amp;T or you may commence an individual action in Small Claims Court.\nIf a court rejects enforcement of any of the limitations on class, representative, private attorney general, or non- individualized relief as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, We agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (except a change to the Notice Address) during your Service commitment, you may reject any such change by sending AT&amp;T written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address.\nBy rejecting any future change, You agree to arbitrate any dispute in accordance with the language of this provision.</p>\n<p>If you are located in Puerto Rico, in addition to

Service(s) and continues through the Term of Service, typically a 12 month or 24 month period (\"Service Commitment\"), specified on your Customer Service Summary.\nAt the end of your service commitment, this Agreement will automatically continue on a month-to-month basis.\nIf your Agreement has no Service Commitment, it is a month-to-month Agreement.</p> Device Activation.\n<p>If You purchased a device that was shipped to You, You agree to activate the device within seven (7) days of the shipment date.\nIf Your device is not activated by You, we may activate the device for You

the Services described in your Customer Service Summary for the term of your Service Commitment, or you can terminate your Agreement prior to the end of your Service Commitment and pay an Early Termination Fee (\"ETF\").\nThe Early Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is an alternative means for you to perform your obligations under the Agreement that partially compensates us for the fact that the Service Commitment on which your rate plan is based was not completed.</p> Your Termination Rights.\n<p>Within the first 14 days after service activation, you may terminate your

Equipment had you not agreed to a Service Commitment.\nAT&amp;T also may charge you a restocking fee for any returned Equipment.\nSome dealers may impose additional fees.</p>\n<p>After the first 14 days, you may terminate your Agreement for any reason.\nHowever, you agree to pay AT&amp;T for all fees, charges, and other amounts incurred and owed under your Agreement along with the applicable ETF.\nThe Early Termination Fee is either: (a) $325 or (b) $150.\nThe ETF reduces each full month of your Service Commitment that you complete.\nTo determine whether your Equipment has a $325 Early Termination Fee or a $150 Early Termination Fee, and the amount of reduction, check att.com/equipmentETF.</p>\n<p>After your Service Commitment ends and you are on a month-to-month Agreement, you may terminate your Agreement at any time with 30 days notice without incurring an ETF.\nIf you sign a new Agreement before the end of the term of your existing Agreement and terminate that new Agreement within 14 days as allowed above, you agree that you will be bound by the terms and conditions of your existing Agreement including fulfillment of any remaining Service Commitment thereunder.</p>\n1.2

least 30 days before we make any materially adverse change.\nSo, for instance, if we increase your rate plan or the price of any of your Services more than what we\u2019ve previously told you (such as

RIGHTS.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Summary:</u>\n</p>\n<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-331-0500.\n<b>In the unlikely event that AT&amp;T's customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint you may have to your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</b> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n<b>Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b> For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration.\nMoreover, in arbitration you are entitled to recover attorneys' fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as you would be in court.</p>\n<p>In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys' fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered you to settle the dispute.</p>\n2.2 <u>Arbitration Agreement</u>\n<ol>\n<li>AT&amp;T and you agree to arbitrate <b>all disputes and claims</b> between us.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to:<ul>\n<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>\n<li>claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>\n<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand</li>\n<li>claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>References to \"AT&amp;T,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Devices under this or prior Agreements between us.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\n<b>You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and AT&amp;T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</b> This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").\nThe Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: Office for Dispute Resolution, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 (\"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf AT&amp;T and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or AT&amp;T is entitled.\nYou may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at att.com/arbitration-forms.</li>\n<li>After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $75,000.\n(The filing fee currently is $200 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.\n(You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at att.com/arbitration-information.) The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide.\nUnless AT&amp;T and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nExcept as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nIn addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</li>\n<li>If, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of AT&amp;T's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:<ul>\n<li>pay you the amount of the award or $10,000 (\"the alternative payment\"), whichever is greater.\nand</li>\n<li>pay your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys' fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for&nbsp;investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (\"the attorney premium\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The right to attorneys' fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (4) supplements any right to attorneys' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.\nHowever, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys' fees or costs.\nAlthough under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.</li>\n<li>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\n<b>YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</b> Further, unless both you and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) during your Service Commitment, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</li>\n</ol>\n2.3 <u>Puerto Rico Customers</u>\n<p>For Puerto Rico customers, references to \"small claims
