Covers <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use our websites (including memberful.com) and any products and services that are available on or through our websites.\nThroughout this Privacy Policy we\u2019ll refer to our website and other products and services collectively as \u201cServices.\u201d</p>\n<p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that information.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@memberful.com.</p>\n<p>If you are a visitor of a site which is running Services provided by Memberful (\u201cMemberful Enabled Site\u201d), the \u2018End Users\u2019 section of this Privacy Policy applies to you.</p>\n<p>If you are an employee or independent contractor personnel of Memberful, the \u2018Human Resources\u2019 section of this Privacy Policy applies to you.</p> Information We Collect <p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so\u2013for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>\n<p>We collect information in three ways: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p> Information You Provide to Us <p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us.\nThe amount and type of information depends on the context and how we use the information.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration Information: We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account - for example, your name and email address.</li>\n<li>Transaction and Billing Information: If you buy something from us, you will provide additional personal and payment information that is required to process the transaction and your payment, such as your name, credit card information, and contact information.</li>\n<li>Content Information: In connection with using the Services, you may generate content that provides us with additional information about you.</li>\n<li>Credentials: In connection with using the Services, you may provide us with credentials for your website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).</li>\n<li>Communications with Us: You may also provide us information when you respond to surveys or communicate with us about a support question.</li>\n</ul> Information We Collect Automatically <p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log Information: Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services.</li>\n<li>Usage Information: We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site\u2013in other words, who did what, when and to what thing on a site (e.g., [username] deleted \u201c[content]\u201d at [time/date]).\nWe also collect information about what happens when you use our Services along with information about your device (e.g., mobile screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, as well as get insights on how people use our Services, so we can make our Services better.</li>\n<li>Location Information: We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.\nWe may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (when, for example, you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system\u2019s permissions.</li>\n<li>Information from Cookies &amp.\nOther Technologies: A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and e-mails.\nWe use cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services.</li>\n</ul> Information We Collect from Other Sources <p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you connect your account to a third-party service provider, we may receive information from that service.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.\nWe may also get information from third party services about individuals who are not yet our users (\u2026but we hope will be!), which we may use, for example, for marketing and advertising purposes.</p> How We Use Information <p>We use information about you as mentioned above and as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide our Services\u2013for example, to set up and maintain your account, backup and restore your content, charge you for any of our paid Services, and provide you support for the Services;</li>\n<li>To further develop our Services\u2013for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy or find useful;</li>\n<li>To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use;</li>\n<li>To monitor and protect the security of our Services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other illegal activities, fight spam, and protect the rights and property of Memberful and others.\nand</li>\n<li>To communicate with you about offers and promotions offered by Memberful and others we think will be of interest to you, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date on Memberful and our products.</li>\n</ul> How We Share Information <p>We do not sell our users\u2019 private personal information.</p>\n<p>We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf.\nWe require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.</li>\n<li>Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us.\nThis group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like payment providers that process your credit and debit card information) and those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).</li>\n<li>As Required by Law: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>\n<li>To Protect Rights and Property: We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Memberful, third parties, or the public at large.\nFor example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>\n<li>Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Memberful goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nIf any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\nFor example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorize us to do so.</li>\n<li>Aggregated and De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services.</li>\n<li>Published Support Requests: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.</li>\n</ul> Information Shared Publicly <p>Information that you choose to make public is\u2013you guessed it\u2013disclosed publicly.\nThat means, of course, that information like any content that you make public on your website is all available to others.\nPublic information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.\nPlease keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share.</p> Other Things You Should Know (Keep Reading!) Transferring Information <p>Memberful is a worldwide service.\nBy accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer, and storage of information in and to the U.S.\nand other countries, which may have rights and protections that are different from those in your home country.</p> EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Frameworks

Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.\nMemberful complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>\n<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Memberful is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission.\nIn certain situations, Memberful may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public

of your personal information.\nEU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Andrew Strojny at Memberful at privacyshield@memberful.com.</p>\n<p>Memberful has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, you may visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint (free of charge).\nTo facilitate fast and convenient resolution of complaints, you agree to participate in online dispute resolution through JAMS Online Mediation (Endispute).</p>\n<p>If your Privacy Shield complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, and your complaint involves human resources data transferred to the United States from the EU in the context of the employment relationship, Memberful commits to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPA Panel) and to comply with the advice given by the DPA Panel with regard to such human resources data.\nTo pursue an unresolved human resources complaint, you should contact the state or national data protection or labor authority in the appropriate jurisdiction.\nContact details for the EU data protection authorities can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</p>\n<p>Under certain conditions, Privacy Shield provides the right to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have not provided resolution.\nThis is described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield.</p> Third Party Software <p>If you\u2019d like to use third party software/services with our Services, please keep in mind that when you interact with them you may provide information about yourself to those third parties.\nWe don\u2019t own or control these third parties and they have their own rules about collection, use and sharing of information.\nYou should review their rules and policies when installing and using any third party software/services.</p> Opting Out of Electronic Communications <p>You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us.\nJust follow the instructions in those messages.\nIf you opt out of promotional messages, we may still send you other messages, like those about your account and legal notices.</p> Our Commitment to Protecting Your Data <p>Our customers may benefit from a number of rights in relation to their information that we process.\nSome rights apply only in certain limited cases, depending on your location.\nIf you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your personal information, you can do so via your Memberful account settings or by contacting us.\nUpon request, Memberful will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information.\nBy visiting your account settings, you can access, correct, change, and delete certain personal information associated with your account.\nIn certain cases where we process your information, you may also have a right to restrict or limit the ways in which we use your personal information.\nIn certain circumstances, you also have the right to request the deletion of your personal information, and to obtain a copy of your personal information in an easily accessible format.</p>\n<p>If we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you can object to this processing in certain circumstances.\nIn such cases, we will cease processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal reasons.</p>\n<p>For more information about our commitment to data protection, please see the Memberful Data Protection policy.</p> Your Obligations to Respect Individual User\u2019s Rights <p>In connection with using our Services, you may receive and determine what to do with certain personal information from your users, such as when communicating with them and entering into transactions with them.\nThis means you process personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and, to the extent you do so, under EU law, you are an independent controller of data relating to other users that you may have obtained through the Services.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for protecting user personal information you receive or process and complying with all relevant legal requirements when you use the Services.\nThis includes applicable data protection and privacy laws that govern the ways in

Memberful\u2019s Terms of Use.\nFor more information on the General Data Protection Regulation, see more resources at https://gdpr-info.eu and http://gdprandyou.ie.</p>\n<p>As a data controller, to the extent that you process users\u2019 personal information outside of the Services, you may be required under applicable data protection and privacy laws to honor requests for data access, portability, correction, deletion, and objections to processing.\nAlso, if you disclose personal information without the user\u2019s proper consent, you are responsible for that unauthorized disclosure.\nThis includes, for example, disclosures you intentionally make or unintentional data breaches.\nFor example, you may receive a buyer\u2019s email address or other information as a result of entering into a transaction with that buyer.\nThis information may only be used for the authorized purpose.\nYou may not use this information for unsolicited commercial messages or unauthorized transactions.\nWithout the user\u2019s consent, and subject to other applicable Memberful policies and laws, you may not add any user to your email or physical mailing list, use that user\u2019s identity for marketing, or obtain or retain any payment information.\nPlease bear in mind that you're responsible for knowing the standard of consent required in any given instance.</p>\n<p>If Memberful and you are found to be joint data controllers of personal information, and if Memberful is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did as a joint data controller of users\u2019 personal information, you agree to indemnify Memberful for the expenses it occurs in connection with your processing of users\u2019 personal information.</p> End Users <p>If
