information with FPAs about your application and policies in order to help us do this.\nThis information will be given to other organisations.\n<strong>More information can be found here.</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\nChanges to your data\n<p>You should tell us if the personal information you have provided to us changes so that we can update our records.\nThe contact details for this purpose are in your policy documents.\nWe\u2019ll then update your records if we can.</p>\nMonitoring communications\n<p>We may monitor communications with you, where permitted by law.\nWe do this for quality control and staff training purposes, to comply with regulatory rules, to prevent or detect crime, to protect the security of our communications, data, and systems, and to enforce compliance with our internal policies.</p>\nUse of automated decisions\n<p>We sometimes make decisions about you using only technology, where none of our employees or any other individuals have been involved.\nWe do this to decide whether to offer you a product or service, to determine the risk of doing so, the price we will offer, whether to offer you credit, what terms and condition to offer you, assess lending, insurance and business risks, or to assess what payment methods we can offer you.\nWe may do this using data from other parts of the AA (AA Group and AA branded companies) and policy underwriters, including product or services details (including usage of claims made) and telematics data captured, including on your vehicle, driving behaviour and location information.</p>\n<p>To understand the logic involved in this and why we do this, you may wish to consider the following example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\tAssess your credit worthiness and ability \u2013 for example, if you are applying for credit and have a history of late or non-payment of debts, we may not able to offer you credit or do so at a higher rate.</li>\n<li>\tAssess our ability to offer our products and services and manage those accounts \u2013 for example, we will take account of your history of using your policy or policies.\nIf you or your beneficiaries make claims or have calls outs or, or if we have concerns about potential use of a policy (for example, if you are in breach of the conditions) or circumstances this may result in a higher risk being assigned to you, meaning you may be quoted a higher price or a policy being declined or cancelled.</li>\n<li>\tAssess the risk of fraud \u2013 if we believe there is a significant risk of fraud, based on the information we hold or that is available to us, we may decline your application, quote a higher price or decline or cancel your policy or application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do this because it is necessary for entering into or performing the relevant insurance or credit agreement with you.\nWe may do so if it is authorised by law or is based on your explicit consent.</p>\nRetention of your personal data\n<p>Unless we explain otherwise to you, we\u2019ll hold your personal information based on the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\tFor as long as we provide products or services to you and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us;</li>\n<li>\tTo comply with legal and regulatory requirements or guidance.\nor</li>\n<li>\tFor as long as we have reasonable business needs.</li>\n</ul>\nYour data protection rights\n<p>Here is a list of the rights that all individuals have under UK data protection laws.\nThey don\u2019t apply in all circumstances so your request may not always be granted.\nIf you wish to use any of them, we will explain when we respond to you if they apply or not, or if we will comply or not with your request, including the reasons why.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\tThe right to be informed about the processing of your personal information;</li>\n<li>\tThe right to have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate and to have incomplete personal information completed;</li>\n<li>\tThe right to object to processing of your personal information;</li>\n<li>\tThe right to restrict processing of your personal information;</li>\n<li>\tThe right to
