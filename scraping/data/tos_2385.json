purposes we have disclosed to you (such as archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who does Syniverse share my personal information with? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose your personal information for our business purposes and where required in relation to our contractual or legal obligations to the following categories of recipients: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>To our group companies, third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of, provide functionality on, or help to enhance the security of our Website or to support the delivery of our Services, such as messaging, through the onward transmission of communications), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or notified to you when we collect your personal information.\nA list of our current group companies is available upon request and a list of our current service providers and partners is available upon request.\n</li>\n<li>To any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.\n</li>\n<li>To an actual or potential buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any actual or proposed purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of our business, provided that we inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice.\n</li>\n<li>To any other person with your consent to the disclosure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal basis for processing personal information (EEA and Brazilian visitors only)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area or Brazil, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\n</p>\n<p>However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect or process personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.\nExamples where we may have a legal obligation to process your personal information include where we are required to assist law enforcement authorities with interception of certain telecommunications supported services, such as our messaging services, or where we are required to filter telecommunications, such as text messaging, for spam or other illegal content.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).\n</p>\n<p>If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Website and provide our other Services, such as messaging.\nOur legitimate interests may also include communicating with you as necessary to provide our Services to you and when responding to your queries, improving our Services, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.\nWe may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.\n</p>\n<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How does Syniverse keep my personal information secure? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.\nThe measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.\nFor more information on measures we use please refer to the Syniverse Information Security Policy, a copy of which may be requested by emailing your request to dpo@syniverse.com.\nWe also take measures to ensure service providers that process personal data on our behalf also have appropriate security measures in place.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>International data transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.\nThese countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p>\n<p>Specifically, our Website servers are located in the United States, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.\nThis means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.\n</p>\n<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice.\nThese include implementing the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.\nOur Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request.\nWe have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data retention </strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).\n</p>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your data protection rights </strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area or Brazil, you have the following data protection rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.\nIn addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.\nAgain, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.\n</li>\n<li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.\nYou can exercise this right by clicking on the unsubscribe or opt-out link in the marketing e-mails we send you.\nTo opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.\n</li>\n<li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.\nWithdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\n</li>\n<li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.\nFor more information, please contact your local data protection authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data

protection laws Introduction<p>Syniverse provides this information to answer the most frequently asked questions that our customers ask about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nIt does not, and is not intended to, confer legal advice.\nYou should always speak to your own, independent legal advisers to understand your legal responsibilities under the GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This information is organized in two sections.\nThe first section provides an overview of the data protection law that applies to Syniverse, and the second provides a description of Syniverse's data processing operations and how the company complies with applicable data protection law.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Data Protection Law<p>\n<br>\n</p>What are data protection laws?<p>Data protection laws govern the way businesses collect, use, and share personal data about individuals.\nAmong other things, they require businesses</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To process individuals' personal data fairly and lawfully</li>\n<li>To allow individuals to exercise legal rights with respect to their personal data (e.g., to access, correct or delete their personal data)</li>\n<li>To have in place appropriate security protections in order to protect the personal data that they process</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What laws in the European Union govern data protection?<p> In the European Union, data protection rules are set out in a data protection law called the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>What is the General Data Protection Regulation?<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (or \"<strong>GDPR</strong>\") (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is Europe's data protection law that became effective on May 25, 2018.\nThe GDPR is a major overhaul of the data protection rules, and Syniverse, like many organizations, has taken steps to ensure that it is compliant with GDPR from the time the new law took effect.</p>\n<p>GDPR aims to update Europe's existing data protection rules to make sure they are fit for the 21<sup>st</sup> century.\nAmong other things, it harmonizes data protection rules throughout European Union member states, introduces new requirements for data processors (the original directive applied only to data controllers), enhances individual's privacy rights (introducing new rights to be forgotten and to data portability), and creates significant penalties for non-compliance (including potential fines of up to 4% annual worldwide revenue).</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Who does the GDPR apply to?<p>The GDPR applies to any organization which is established within the European Union (e.g., has a subsidiary or branch in the EU).\nIt also applies to any non-EU organization which either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Offers goods or services to individuals in the EU (including free goods and services).\nor</li>\n<li>Monitors the behavior of individuals in the EU (for example, through the use of advertising or analytics technologies).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>Does European data protection law apply only to data controllers?<p>No.\nOne of the significant changes brought in by the GDPR is that it applies to <u>both</u> data controllers and to data processors.\nThere are, however, more obligations imposed on data controllers under the GDPR than on data processors.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>What is a data controller and a data processor?<p>\n</p>\n<p>A <u>data controller</u> is the entity that determines the \"purposes and means of the processing\" of data \u2013 in other words, how and why personal data will be processed.<br>\n<br>A <u>data processor</u> processes personal data only on behalf of, and under the instruction of, a data controller.</p>\n<p>Go to top</p>Syniverse's Approach to Data Protection LawDoes Syniverse comply with the GDPR?<p>Like any responsible organization, Syniverse aims to comply with the data protection laws that apply to it.\nBecause Syniverse has an EU establishment, the company is directly subject to GDPR (see our FAQ above \"<em>Who does the GDPR apply to?</em>\").</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What types of products and services does Syniverse provide?<p>Syniverse is a leading global transaction processor that connects Mobile Network Operators and enterprises in nearly 200 countries, enabling seamless mobile communications across disparate and rapidly evolving networks, devices and applications.\n<br>\n<br> Syniverse processes transactions that include the authorization and delivery of end-user traffic, clearing of billing records and settlement of payments.\nSyniverse also offers a unique portfolio of intelligent policy and charging tools that enable its customers to use the real-time data generated by these transactions to deliver customized services and choices to their end users.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What type of personal data is Syniverse collecting?<p>The types of personal data Syniverse will process as part of its normal business include device data, such as device identifiers and similar device-related information (e.g.\nIMSI, sender ID, destination MSISDN), as well as IP addresses, and billing data (e.g., TAP files under GSMA rules).</p>\n<p>In addition, Syniverse processes personal data about our employees and business contact data relating to our customers, suppliers and other individuals with whom we have a business relationship.\nWe also gather personal information through our website.</p>\n<p>Syniverse does not generally process sensitive personal data, other than personal data of our employees.\nSyniverse takes care to protect all the personal information that we hold in accordance with law.</p>\n<p>Syniverse has invested considerable effort as part of its GDPR preparations to have a robust record of data that it processes \u2013 both as a data processor for customers and as a data controller \u2013 to have a clear understanding of the legal basis under which we process that data.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Is Syniverse a controller or processor?<p>When providing its services to customers, Syniverse is generally a data processor processing personal data at the instruction of its customers, the controller.</p>\n<p>However, in some circumstances Syniverse may be a data controller, such as when we collect business contact data relating to our customers, suppliers and other individuals with whom we have a business relationship and where we provide business analysis tools through various Syniverse hosted portals to customer employees or gather personal information through our website.</p>\n<p>Syniverse also considers itself a controller of communications meta data (i.e.\ndata processed for the conveyance of (or billing of) any electronic communication or communication on an electronic communications network, including connection and records, routing information, tracking information), where Syniverse uses this data for its own billing and tracking purposes and is determining the routing for a message (e.g., which text message aggregators and operators to use to route the messages).\nSyniverse is also a controller of its own employees\u2019 personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What is Syniverse's lawful basis for processing personal data?<p>Syniverse will only be able to process personal data if it can demonstrate it has a lawful processing ground \u2013 such as performance of a contract, reliance on its legitimate interests \u2013 where processing is to comply with a legal obligation or with consent from the individual whose personal information is processed.\nAs part of our data mapping exercise Syniverse confirmed and recorded the legal basis for processing for each type of process or application.</p>How does Syniverse provide transparency to data subjects?<p>Syniverse provides clear high-level descriptions of the data it processes in its privacy policies and internal notices, which it has reviewed, updated and published on the company\u2019s intranet (for internal policies) and external website, Syniverse.com.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What data protection rights do data subjects have?<p>Under the GDPR, individuals can exercise the following rights against data controllers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A right to request access to, and a copy of, personal information processed about them</li>\n<li>A right to correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information processed about them</li>\n<li>A right to object to processing of their personal information</li>\n<li>A right to request erasure of their personal information (e.g., end users may want that their data gets deleted)</li>\n<li>A right to request that processing of their personal information be restricted (e.g., this can be supported with the \u201cdo not track\u201d option in the browser)</li>\n<li>A right not to be subject to automated decisions that significantly or legally affect them</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Syniverse has put in place procedures to ensure that it handles all such requests made to it as a controller in compliance with the GDPR.\nFor data where Syniverse is a processor, Syniverse also has processes in place to ensure it forwards any such requests it receives to the relevant customer for response and will assist the controller in responding as required by the GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Will customer personal data ever be transferred outside Europe?<p>If our customers are located outside of Europe, yes.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, please note that Syniverse is a US-headquartered company with affiliates in the European Union, Cost Rica, India and Asia Pacific, and we enable individual mobile subscribers to make calls or send messages when roaming.\nSyniverse operates on a global basis in support of its customers.\n<br>\n<br> Customer personal data may be transferred outside Europe, including to the US.\nWith certain products and internal applications, we also work with international service providers who help us to manage and deliver our services.\nHowever, they do so under strict contractual terms to ensure they protect the privacy and security of customer personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What data transfer solution does Syniverse have in place?<p>Syniverse has put in place a revised global data transfer agreement based on the EU model clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What other steps has Syniverse taken to be compliant with GDPR requirements?<p>We understand the single biggest novelty of the GDPR is the introduction of requirements intended to make businesses more accountable for their data practices.\nWe realize that it is important for Syniverse to document its activities, so the company can demonstrate compliance to a customer or competent authority.\nSyniverse has taken steps to adopt and enforce policies and procedures, including those regarding data retention, data privacy impact assessments, and data security policies and incident response plans.</p>\n<p>Syniverse has provided documented training for all staff around the globe on the basic elements of GDPR.\nFurther courses and individual training will be rolled out as the Syniverse privacy curriculum evolves.\n</p>\n<p> Given the scale and nature of data processing Syniverse undertakes on a global basis, the company has appointed a Data Protection Officer, for whom contact details are listed below.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>What security measures does Syniverse apply to protect personal data?<p>Syniverse is committed to ensuring that personal data is secure.\nSyniverse implements appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect personal data against: (i) accidental or unlawful destruction.\nand (ii) loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access.\nFor more information concerning the technical and organisation measures taken by Syniverse please refer to the Data Protection Officer contact information below.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Will Syniverse update its terms for GDPR compliance?<p>Yes.\nSyniverse has reviewed its website privacy policy, internal notices and developed data processing agreements both for vendors and customers.\nIf you require a data processing agreement, please refer to the Data Protection Officer contact information below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>Who do I contact if I have further questions?<p>If you have any further questions about Syniverse's compliance with EU data protection requirements or GDPR, please contact the Syniverse Data Protection Officer
