COURT.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nYou and Indiegogo agree that this arbitration undertaking is made\npursuant to or in connection with a transaction involving interstate\ncommerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in\naccordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C.\nSection 1, et\nseq.\n</strong>\n<strong>\nTerms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal

that may arise after the\ntermination of these Terms.\nThe only disputes excluded from this\nSection are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small\ncourt claims, as provided below.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes\nwith Indiegogo as follows:\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Pre-Arbitration Dispute</em>\n</strong>\n<em>\n<strong>Resolution</strong>\n</em>\n: For any and all disputes, claims, or controversies you may have against\nIndiegogo (\u201cDisputes\u201d), whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must\nfirst give us an opportunity to resolve the Dispute informally by\ncontacting us through this link\nwith the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a\nwritten description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific\nrelief you seek.\nIf we do not resolve the Dispute within forty-five (45)\ndays after receiving your notification, then you may pursue resolution of\nthe Dispute in arbitration.\nYou may pursue your Dispute in a court only\nunder the circumstances described below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\n<u>Arbitration Procedures</u>\n</em>\n</strong>\n<em>\n<u>:</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the Dispute has not been resolved and is not subject to the exclusions\nprovided above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the\nsole means to resolve all Disputes, subject to the terms set forth below.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll Disputes shall be resolved before a single arbitrator in accordance\nwith the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims that\ndo not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and\nProcedures for claims exceeding $250,000, in each case applying the rules\nand procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated,\nexcluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.\nYou can find the JAMS rules and procedures\nhere at this link.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a\nDemand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the\namount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for\nArbitration at www.jamsadr.com).\n(2) send three copies of the Demand for\nArbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2 Embarcadero\nCenter, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111.\nand (3) send three copies of\nthe Demand for Arbitration to Indiegogo at 965 Mission St, 6th Floor, San\nFrancisco, CA 94103, ATTN: Legal Department.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us.\nIf\nthe arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Indiegogo will\npay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator\nand hearing expenses.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys' fees\nunless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Location of Arbitration</em>\n</strong>: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the\narbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in San\nFrancisco, California.\nIf you live outside the United States, you must\ninitiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in\nSan Francisco, California.\nEither party may ask that the arbitration\nincluding the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted\ntelephonically or by video conference (<em>e.g., </em>Skype).\n</p>\n<p>\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall\nhave exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating\nto the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these\nTerms, Additional Policies, or the Privacy Policy, including but not\nlimited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms, Additional\nPolicies, or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject\nto arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.\nThe\narbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available\nin a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be written\nand shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court with\njurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision,\nthey would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey\nfurther understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could\nexceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more\nlimited in arbitration than in court.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>:\n<strong>\nThe parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their\nindividual capacities only and not as a class action or other\nrepresentative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to\nfile a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nTHIS MEANS THAT\nYOU AND INDIEGOGO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER\nONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR\nREPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS\nOR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nHOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT\nSEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY\nEITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR\nARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR\nOCCURRENCE(S).\nCONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY\nINITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR\nSUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY\nA SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION.\nIF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS\nCONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE\nCONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO\nDESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH\nRESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION.\nTHE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE\nCONSIDERED IN REQUESTING A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS:\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>The arbitrations have a common question of law or fact;</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nThe issues in the multiple arbitrations are largely identical.\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nThere are common claims, disputes, defenses, and relationships between\nor among the parties in the different arbitrations.\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nOne or more parties is named in multiple pending arbitrations.\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nThe arbitrations relate to the same campaign featured on Indiegogo\u2019s\nplatform.\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consolidation will save time and resources;</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nOne party will be seriously prejudiced by having multiple arbitrations\nheard separately.\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\nBy agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury\nor to participate in a class action.\nWe are also waiving these rights.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Exclusions from Arbitration</em>\n</strong>:\n<strong>\n<em>Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</em>:\n</strong>\nNotwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve Disputes through\narbitration, either party may (1) bring enforcement actions, validity\ndeterminations or claims arising from or relating to misuse, infringement,\nor misappropriation of intellectual property theft, piracy or unauthorized\nuse of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights\n(\"intellectual property rights\" means patents, copyrights, moral rights,\ntrademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).\nand/or\n(2) seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the\nscope of that court's jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>30-Day Right to Opt-Out</em>\n</strong>\n<em>:</em>\n<em>\nYou have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and\nclass action waiver provisions set forth above.\n</em>\nYou can opt out of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set\nforth above by sending an email from your registered email address on\nIndiegogo to us here with the\nsubject line, \"ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\" To opt-out,\nyou must send the email to Indiegogo with the required language within\nthirty (30) days of the later of the following: (i) of your creation of an\nIndiegogo account or your first transaction with Indiegogo, whichever is\nearlier.\nor (ii) the date of notice from Indiegogo of a material change to\nthis Section via email to you.\nTo be clear, if you opt out of the\narbitration and class action waiver provision, you will be able to pursue\nany potential claims in a court of law<strong>\n<em> and </em>\n</strong>can\nparticipate in a class action or other class proceeding if you so desire.\nIf you do not opt out properly, you agree to arbitrate.\nIf you opt out of\nthe arbitration and class action waiver provisions, we will not be subject\nto them either with respect to any disputes with you, meaning Indiegogo can\nalso litigate in a court of law and be subject to class action litigation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Severability</em>\n</strong>\n<em>: </em>\nIf a court or arbitrator decides that any portion of this Section regarding\nDispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is invalid or\nunenforceable, then the portion shall be severed from the Terms and/or\ndeemed modified, only to the extent necessary to make it lawful.\nSuch\ninvalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of\nthe Terms that are not invalid or unenforceable.\nTo affect the modification\nof the portion, the portion shall be deemed deleted, added to, and/or\nrewritten, whichever shall most fully preserve the intentions of the\nparties as originally expressed herein.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed\nin all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to\nits conflict of law provisions.\nThis \u201cDispute Resolution, Arbitration and\nClass Action Waiver\u201d section
