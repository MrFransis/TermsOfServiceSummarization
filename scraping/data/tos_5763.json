sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment.\nIf your balance is insufficient to cover the refund, we will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your

case Processor will retain the funds.\n(ii) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired.\nor (iii) we determine that a

failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible chargeback.\nWe reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating chargeback disputes.</p>\n<p>2.21 Our Set-off Rights.&nbsp;To the extent permitted by law, we, and our Processor, may set off against the balances for any obligation you owe us under these terms, including without limitation any chargebacks.\nAny fees assessed in association with a transaction

than the correct amount to which you were entitled, we will credit your account for the difference.\nIf the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount to which you were entitled, we will debit the extra funds from your account.\nWe will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error.\nYour failure to notify us of a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.</p>\n<p>2.23 Card Data Security and Access to
