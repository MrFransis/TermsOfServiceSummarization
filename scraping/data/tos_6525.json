cost paid traffic sent to your site with the sole purpose of generating clicks.\n(There is a reason why some traffic is so low priced.\nNot all but most low cost traffic websites intentionally send bots to click the ads on your page or are infested with bots coming in from publishers websites.\nSome networks are aware of the issue but do nothing about it, others are unaware of any issues at all and pay for the fraudulent traffic then send it on to you.\nOr another option is they pay users to click ads or purchase traffic that is incentive based from others both are forbidden.\nBecause of
