change or withdraw your cookie consent - See the section \"How you can change your cookie settings, incl.\nopting out\" below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>What do I need to know about cookies?</b>\n</p>\n<p>There are different types of cookies and they are used for different purposes.\n</p>\n<p>Below you can read about what a cookie is, the difference between first and third party cookies and session cookies vs.\npersistent cookies and what types of cookies we use on our website and why.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>What is a cookie?</b>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device

e.g.\nFlash-cookies (Local Shared Objects), Web Storage (HTML5), Javascripts or cookies placed by other software.\n</p>\n<p>A cookie may contain information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return to the website, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</p>\n<p>The word \"cookies\" or \"cookie data\" also covers information about IP and MAC addresses and other information about your device collected by said technologies.</p>\n<p>Cookies are used to enable

collection of personal data via such cookies and the disclosure to the provider.\nThe provider of third-party cookies is data controller for the processing taking place after receiving the personal

provides market research data to website owners through a mixture of online surveys and the use of web beacons.\nAccording to comScore, websites elect to take part in the company's market research.\nThe website owners place ScorecardResearch web beacons into the pages of their website.\nWhen a browser loads a page that contains a ScorecardResearch web beacon, a cookie will be
