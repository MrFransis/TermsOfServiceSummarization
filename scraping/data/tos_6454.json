<p> Agreement to Arbitrate </p>\n<p> If you are accessing and using the Services as an individual consumer (not on behalf of a company or other legal entity), you and Buycott agree that&nbsp;any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an \u201cIP Protection Action\u201d).\nWithout limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at&nbsp;legal@buycott.com&nbsp;or 1613 Chelsea Road, Unit 267, San Marino, CA 91108&nbsp;within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an \u201cArbitration Opt-out Notice\u201d).\nIf you don\u2019t provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Buycott with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\nUnless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Buycott&nbsp;are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.&nbsp;Further, unless both you and Buycott otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> Arbitration Rules </p>\n<p> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration Process </p>\n<p> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration&nbsp;and a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> Arbitration Location and Procedure </p>\n<p>Unless you and Buycott otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Buycott submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> Arbitrator\u2019s Decision </p>\n<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nBuycott will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> Fees </p>\n<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Buycott will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by

Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.\nSo, please make sure that you have read and understand our Terms of Service.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Revisions to this Privacy Policy <p>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.\nWe may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we\u2019ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we\u2019ll update the

primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.\n</p>\n<p>Account Information.\nIf you create an Account, we\u2019ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your full name and email address (\u201cPII\u201d).\nIf you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we\u2019ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.\nIf you create an Account through the Site or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other

information (including any PII) that you may submit to the Services when you create a Campaign.\nWe will also collect any information (including any PII) that you may submit when you post comments and

collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.\n</p>\n<p>\u201cCookies\u201d are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services.\nWe may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you\u2019ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services.\nWe may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services.\nUnlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser.\nAlthough most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.\nPlease note, however, that if you don\u2019t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services.\nSome third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive.\nNote that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\u201cWeb Beacons\u201d (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising.\nUnlike Cookies, which are stored on the user\u2019s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).\n</p>\n<p>Information Related to Use of the Services.\nOur servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as \u201cLog Data\u201d), including both Account holders and

visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics.\nWe use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users\u2019 needs and preferences.\nWe may use a person\u2019s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.\n</p>\n<p>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device.\nWe collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Location Information.&nbsp;When you use our App, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device\u2019s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on

device.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Information that We Share with Third Parties <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:

others\u2019 Campaigns or Causes, we will share the information that you provide via such Campaign and/or Causes with the companies that make or market the products or services to which the Campaign relates or with the companies that are the subject of a Campaign, but only if you select the option via the Services giving us permission to communicate with such companies.\n&nbsp;You and your PII may be included in such communications.\n</p>\n<p>Information Shared With Other Users.\nAs part of the Services, when you interact with the Services your User Content, and any PII contained in such

information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.\n</p>\n<p>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.\nInformation that we collect from our Users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset.\nThus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.\n</p>\n<p>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.\nWe cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law.\nWe may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas).\n(ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and

communications from us, you will have the opportunity to \u201copt-out\u201d (either through your Account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive).\nWe do need to send you certain communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications \u2013 e.g., communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about billing.\n</p>\n<p>Modifying Your Information.\nYou can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by&nbsp;visiting the edit profile tab in our mobile app.\nIf you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at info@buycott.com&nbsp;with your request.\nWe\u2019ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.\n</p>\n<p>Responding to Do Not Track Signals </p>\n<p>Our Site does not have the capability to respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals received from various web browsers.\n</p>\n<p>The Security of Your Information </p>\n<p>We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.\n[When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt this data

the absolute security of any information.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Links to Other Sites </p>\n<p>Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each,

Service.\nTo protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>International Transfer </p>\n<p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.\nIf you\u2019re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.\n</p>\n<p>Our Policy Toward Children </p>\n<p>Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13.\nIf we learn that we have collected PII of a child under the age
