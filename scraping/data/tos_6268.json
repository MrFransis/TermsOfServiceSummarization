products and services, you (\"you\", \"your\", \"Client\" or \"Customer\") agree to comply with our policies.</p>\n<p>WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY FOR THE DATA AND CONTENT TRANSMITTED THROUGH OR TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY STORED ON OUR NETWORK OR ANY SERVER AND FOR THE ACTIONS OR OMISSION OF USERS.</p>\n<p>INTERPRETATION</p>\n<p>The provisions of this AUP are intended as guidelines and are not meant to be exhaustive.\nGenerally, conduct that violates law, regulation, or the accepted norms of the Internet community, whether or not expressly mentioned in this AUP, are prohibited.\nWe reserve the right at all times to prohibit activities that damage our or our affiliates\u2019 commercial reputation and goodwill.\nWe will be the sole and final arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of our policies.</p>\n<p>ILLEGAL USE</p>\n<p>Our products and services may be used only for lawful purposes.\nTransmission of, distribution of, storage of, or linking to any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited.\nThis includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights used without proper authorization, and material that is defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, violates export control laws, or is otherwise prohibited by US law.</p>\n<p>SPAM</p>\n<p>All users must comply with all relevant legislation and regulations on bulk and commercial e-mail, including but not limited to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003.</p>\n<p>Users may not send mass unsolicited e-mail, which is email that is sent to recipients who have not \"opted-in\" to mailings from the user.\nUsers who send mass mailings must maintain complete and accurate records of all consents and opt-ins and provide such records to RamNode upon its request.\nIf a user cannot provide positive and verifiable proof of such consents and opt-ins, we will consider the mass mailing to be unsolicited.\nUsers are prohibited from operating mailing lists, listservs, or mailing services that do not target an audience that has voluntarily signed up for e-mail information using an \"opt-in\" process or that has made their e-mail addresses available to a user for distribution of information.\nUsers who operate mailing lists must maintain complete and accurate records of all consents and \"opt-in\" elections and provide such records to RamNode upon its request.\nIf a user cannot provide positive and verifiable proof of such consents and \"opt-in\" elections, we will consider the list mailing to be unsolicited.\nAny user-maintained mailing list must also allow any party on the list to remove itself automatically and permanently.\nOther prohibited activities include, without limitation, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use of our network for the receipt of replies to unsolicited mass e-mail;</li>\n<li>forgery of e-mail headers (spoofing);</li>\n<li>spamming via third-party proxy, aggregation of proxy lists, or installation of proxy mailing software;</li>\n<li>configuration of a mail server to accept and process third-party messages for sending without user identification and authentication;</li>\n<li>hosting web pages advertised within \"spam e-mail\" sent from another network (spamvertising);</li>\n<li>hosting web pages or providing services that support spam;</li>\n<li>any other unsolicited bulk messages, postings, or transmissions through media such as weblog posts, IRC/chat room messages, guestbook entries, HTTP referrer log entries, usenet posts, pop-up messages, instant messages, or SMS messages.\nand</li>\n<li>instructing others in any activity prohibited by this AUP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If, as a result of your actions, our mail servers or IP address ranges are placed on black hole lists or other mail filtering software systems, your server may be suspended and possibly terminated upon review.\nIf we deem your account at risk for repeated AUP infractions, we may suspend and/or terminate all servers on it.</p>\n<p>HARDWARE RESOURCE USAGE</p>\n<p>VPS </p>\n<ul>\n<li>As in all virtual server environments, CPU cores and disk I/O are shared among multiple VPSs.\nIf your VPS is consistently maxing out one full core or more and impacting the performance of other client servers sharing the same host node, we may ask you to reduce your usage.\nLoad may be generated by CPU usage and/or I/O.\nDisruptive load may result in a reboot, shutdown, and/or suspension of the VPS regardless of the time lapse involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>VDS </p>\n<ul>\n<li>VDS CPU cores are dedicated per VDS.\nYou may use 100% of your allocated CPU indefinitely.\nI/O and network ports are shared like a VPS, so we may ask you to reduce your usage and/or shutdown your VDS in an abusive situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Shared </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our shared hosting product is not a replacement for a CDN (ie: streaming video/files off site, storage of large files or large quantities of seldomly used data/images).\nIf you are found hosting files that use a larger portion of storage and/or bandwidth than what is considered typical for a shared hosting environment, we may ask you to reduce your usage or upgrade to a virtual server.\nExcessive bandwidth usage due to website abuse or bruteforce attacks may result in suspension of services.\nffmpeg, its alternatives, and mass video streaming websites are not allowed on our shared hosting.</li>\n<li>RamNode provides jailed SSH access for our shared hosting customers as a courtesy.\nIf you are found installing or running processes that are meant for a non-shared environment (voice servers, shoutcast, etc.), those processes will be killed and your SSH access will be removed.\nSSH access should only be used for file and permission management and other day to day tasks that are more easily accomplished via a terminal.</li>\n<li>Shared or Reseller hosting can not be used to host Proxies (private or public).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>NETWORK</p>\n<p>Although we have the ability to absorb and tolerate occasional DDoS attacks, clients who have not purchased our optional DDoS filtering and who are targeted with frequent and/or disruptive attacks may be suspended and/or terminated.\nWe have a zero tolerance policy for IPv6 DDoS, meaning customers targeted over IPv6 will be suspended and required to use our IPv4 DDoS-filtering for the related service and/or discontinue use of IPv6.</p>\n<p>We do not allow port scanning or UDP floods to be sent from our network.\nAccounts sending floods, port scanning, and/or creating artificial traffic will be suspended and/or terminated.\nIf your server is found to be degrading the connection speed of other servers, you will be notified via ticket and asked to reduce your usage.</p>\n<p>COMMONLY QUESTIONED USES</p>\n<p>The following are acceptable uses provided they comply with the rest of this AUP: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>IRC<sup>*</sup>\n</li>\n<li>Source games<sup>+</sup>\n</li>\n<li>Minecraft servers<sup>+</sup>\n</li>\n<li>VPN</li>\n<li>Adult material</li>\n<li>Video

which results in any attacks against RamNode the company (not just the client\u2019s server) may result in suspension and/or termination.<br>\n<sup>+</sup>Game servers are not allowed on non-SSD VPSs.</p>\n<p>STRICTLY PROHIBITED USES</p>\n<p>The following are strictly prohibited uses and may result in immediate suspension and/or termination if discovered on your account:

websites</li>\n<li>Shadowsocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Running any of the above items behind a DDoS-filtered IP is still a violation of the AUP.</p>\n<p>Using our IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) to evade IRC or forum bans is also strictly prohibited.</p>\n<p>SECURITY</p>\n<p>Violations of our system or network security are prohibited, and may result in criminal and civil liability.\nOur servers and networks may not be used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>introducing or executing malicious programs into any network or server, such as viruses, worms, Trojan Horses, and key loggers;</li>\n<li>causing or initiating security breaches or disruptions of network communication and/or connectivity, including port scans, flood pings, email-bombing, packet spoofing, IP spoofing, and forged routing information;</li>\n<li>executing any form of network activity that will intercept data not intended for your server;</li>\n<li>evading or circumventing user authentication or security of any host, network or account, including cracking, brute-force, or dictionary attacks;</li>\n<li>interfering with or denying service to any user, host, or network, such as a denial of service attack or distributed denial of service attack;</li>\n<li>conduct designed to avoid restrictions or access limits to specific services, hosts, or networks, including the forging of packet headers or other identification information;</li>\n<li>soliciting the performance of any illegal activity, even if the activity is not performed.\nor</li>\n<li>using any program, or sending messages of any kind, designed to interfere with or disable a user\u2019s terminal session.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The preceding list is an example and not an exhaustive list of prohibited activity.</p>\n<p>LICENSES</p>\n<p>cPanel/WHM and CloudLinux licenses purchased through RamNode are only allowed to be used on the RamNode network.\nLicenses assigned to external IPs will be terminated and the associated account will be suspended and/or terminated.</p>\n<p>Failure to adhere to the Acceptable Use Policy will result in service suspension and possibly termination with no refund.\nAny activity not mentioned above but which is considered illegal in the United States will result in immediate termination.</p>\n<p>DMCA / LEGAL</p>\n<p>Please send all abuse reports to

order in which they are received.\nMultiple replies to tickets will not ensure that you receive a faster response.\nWe only offer support in English and require that it be used to communicate with our staff.\nWe do not tolerate profanity or abusive language in any form of contact with us including, but not limited to, emails, our ticket system, our IRC channel, or our community forum.\nSuch behavior will result in a warning, followed by suspension and/or termination if the warning is not heeded.</p>\n<p>Virtual Server Support</p>\n<p>RamNode servers are unmanaged.\nRamNode servers are designed for web hosts, advanced Linux administrators, and experienced webmasters.\nIn order to successfully manage our servers, the customer should be familiar with Linux operating systems, tools, and services.\nRamNode provides basic tools needed to configure and maintain the customer\u2019s server.\nRamNode provides knowledgebase articles covering various topics which may offer insight into common questions regarding our servers.\nRamNode also provides remote console access to our servers which gives the customer a way to access his or her server even with a broken SSH configuration.\n</p>\n<p>You are responsible for managing your virtual server.\nRamNode staff is available for general support covering the areas below.\nRamNode also works around the clock to ensure that our hardware and network is and up running as expected.</p>\n<p>You may contact RamNode for support regarding the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network access.\nPlease check our @NodeStatus Twitter page or our @RamNode page before submitting a ticket.</li>\n<li>Server hardware.\nPlease check our @NodeStatus Twitter page or our @RamNode page before submitting a ticket.</li>\n<li>Control panel.\nIf you experience problems with any Cloud Control Panel or SolusVM functionality, please open a ticket.</li>\n<li>OS templates and ISOs.\nIf you notice any bugs with our OS templates or ISOs, please open a support ticket.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This list may not be exhaustive, but it represents the general idea of our unmanaged hosting.\nAnything that we do not install and configure for the client is the client\u2019s responsibility and is not covered by our support.\nWe will not install or configure additional packages on a server that are not present in our default OS templates.</p>\n<p>Shared Hosting Support</p>\n<p>RamNode shared hosting support covers the hosting environment, not a customer's individual website(s), script(s), or database(s).\nExamples of issues we cannot assist with include (but are not limited to):\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Out of date scripts (this includes Joomla/Wordpress installs, wordpress plugins, custom theme extensions, etc.).</li>\n<li>Scripts that require non-standard hosting environments.\n(Anything that would need to be configured or added outside of the cPanel/WHM interfaces.)</li>\n<li>Any backend service which is not managed and installed natively in our environment.\n(NoSQL, TeamSpeak plugins, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Customers are responsible for keeping their scripts up to date.\nRamNode does not provide support for website problems resulting from outdated scripts or installations.\nWe recommend that our customers use the included Softaculous script manager to install available scripts.\nSoftaculous can assist in keeping scripts up to date.</p>\n<p>RamNode shared support is available for non-critical issues between the hours of 11AM and 7PM eastern.\nCritical support for server or network problems is available 24/7/365.</p>\n<p>Service Payment, Refunds and Cancellation Guidelines</p>\n<p>For prepay-only services such as SolusVM and Shared hosting, invoices are generated 10 days before payment is due.\nFailure to pay by the due date will result in suspended and, ultimately, terminated service.\nCredit cards left on file will be automatically charged on the invoice due date unless you have submitted a cancellation request through the Client Area prior.\nRamNode reserves the right to terminate your service at any point after your invoice is overdue, and will not be responsible for any data loss due to termination.</p>\n<p>Prepay and postpay options are available for cloud service.\nIf a credit card is left on file with us, it will be automatically charged at least once a month according to your cloud service usage.\nAll other payment methods are considered prepay, requiring you to maintain a cloud credit balance in order to use our cloud service.\nYou will receive email notifications when your cloud credit is running low.\nCloud service may be suspended and/or terminated once your prepaid cloud credit drops below $0.</p>\n<p>Billable cloud services include instances, images (uploaded images, snapshots, and backups), and public network transfer.\nInstances count toward your usage as long as they exist (including when powered off).</p>\n<p>RamNode offers a three day refund period for your first payment on your first service with us.\nBitcoin payments are NON-REFUNDABLE.\nSoftware licenses are not eligible for refunds.\nRefunds must be requested via support ticket in the Client Area after a cancellation request has been submitted.</p>\n<p>If the client creates a subscription to pay for his or her service(s) with RamNode, the client is responsible for canceling that subscription when he or she no longer wants service with RamNode.\nRamNode will not be responsible for handling or refunding any transactions that take place after the client has cancelled his or her service with RamNode in the event that the client fails to cancel the related subscription.</p>\n<p>Payment Chargebacks and Billing Disputes</p>\n<p>Raising a billing dispute with our payment processors or charging back a payment made to RamNode will place the client\u2019s account in bad standing.\nWe reserve the right to immediately terminate all services without refund in such instances.</p>\n<p>Other Disputes</p>\n<p>Any threat of legal action against RamNode by a client will result in immediate account and service termination without refund.</p>\n<p>Accounts</p>\n<p>All orders placed through our billing portal are passed through an automatic fraud check system.\nAlthough our services are typically set up instantly upon receipt of payment, we manually review each fraud score before accepting the order.\nIf our fraud check system scores your order as dangerous, we may require submission of a government issued ID to allow continued use of our services.\nFailure to comply in a timely manner may result in suspension and/or termination without refund.</p>\n<p>Ordering from a VPN or proxy will likely cause your order to be flagged as potential fraud, requiring additional verification in order to use our services.\nPlease order without a VPN if at all possible.</p>\n<p>We require your real first and last name, as well as accurate information in all other fields, upon placing an order.\nIf you provide false information when placing an order, your service may be suspended and/or terminated

of their instances through the Cloud Control Panel.\nBackups and snapshots are considered images and are billed according to the prices listed on our website.\nBackup and snapshot data integrity is not guaranteed and should be confirmed by the customer (for example, by launching a new instance from the backup or by downloading and testing elsewhere).\nCustomers are responsible for their own data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SolusVM </p>\n<ul>\n<li>RamNode does not take backups of SolusVM virtual server data.\nWe recommend that customers backup their server data to their personal computers or remote storage servers.\nCustomers are responsible for their own data.\nRamNode shall by no means be responsible for data loss.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shared </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Although RamNode does backup all shared hosting accounts daily, we cannot guarantee the integrity of customer data or databases taken at the time of backup.\nWe encourage all customers to use the backup function available to them in their cPanel control panel to take their own remote backups periodically through the month.\nNote: Any backups taken through cPanel and stored on the server will be removed automatically once the backup is more than 48 hours old.\nEnsure to download your backup files as soon as you generate them if you would like to keep the data stored in the cPanel backup archive.</li>\n<li>RamNode provides a backup interface for customers to restore files and databases.\nWe cannot assist with backup restoration outside of the features provided to you from within cPanel.\nRestoring a backup may result in overwriting data that has not yet been backed up by our daily backups.\nWe recommend that you take a manual backup from within cPanel before you restore any data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Jurisdiction</p>\n<p>Any claim arising hereunder shall be construed in accordance with the substantive and procedural laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to

arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe place of arbitration shall be Atlanta, Georgia, USA.\nThe arbitration shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia.\nHearings will take place pursuant to the standard procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules that contemplate in person hearings.\nEach party shall bear its own costs and expenses and an equal share of the arbitrators' and administrative fees of arbitration.\nExcept as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.\nThe parties agree that failure or refusal of a party to pay its required share of the deposits for arbitrator compensation or administrative charges shall constitute a waiver by that party to present evidence or cross-examine witness.\nIn such event, the other party shall be required to present evidence and legal argument as the arbitrator may require for the making of an award.\nSuch waiver shall not allow for a default judgment against the non-paying party in the absence of evidence presented as provided for

reference to conflicts of laws principles.</p>\n<p>Severability</p>\n<p>If any portion of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator, such determination shall have no effect on the remaining terms of this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>Last updated: August 2, 2019</p> ", "created_at": "2022-01-08
