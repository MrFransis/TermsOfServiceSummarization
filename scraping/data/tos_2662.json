We want you to use script-blockers, ad-blockers, TOR services, and ideally a VPN client and virus checkers! Although we have our suggestion for a VPN service in our support page we don\u2019t care who you go with as long as you get secured! Protect your hardware from dangerous websites.\nTrust no one! Some day we may all die here and the domain could get hijacked by a bunch of terrible people.\nOr just end up being cyber-squatted until the end of time.</p>\n<p>Even after our death, we want you to be safe out there!</p>\n<p>Onward to the P.S.A.</p>Government requests and privacy.<p>The reason why this page exists is that as of 05/25/2018 entire countries need their governments to behave as net nannies! Instead of downloading ad-blocker and joining a VPN like the rest of the world is doing right now.</p>\n<p>Those very governments want to spy on their people because they\u2019re getting a little jealous that Newsweek is spying on citizens better! The GDPR is a goose-step into a darker Orwellian future that the European government will pay for dearly later.\nAllow us to place everything into perspective.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Fuck the GDPR AND the EU Government! \u2013 S</strong>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also don\u2019t do Government requests if they ask at all.</p>Existence.<p>But why even have this page then? For those who have read my previous article \u201cYou think this site is hacking you?\u201d We of all people know firsthand how word of mouth alone could destroy a website.\nWe were looking for a method or structure to define to you the end user what it is that we do here for you.</p>\n<p>So here we are with a privacy notice!</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in and answer the questions of how we handle data here at www.s-config.com.</p>Site identification.<p>We are a blogger organization hell-bent at running an isolated server on the internet to the best of our abilities.\nThat if all of the data we as bloggers make is in one location you will know exactly where to go.\nSimple and elegant that way.\nOur content is what you read.\nOur revenue stream is none of your concern.</p>\n<p>Our identities are that we\u2019re a 5 foot 8 inch or 1.72 Meter Anthropomorphic Asian Bear Cats known as <em>\u201cBinturong\u201d</em> and really that\u2019s the best answer you will get out of us.\nWe totally dig grapes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Grapes are delicious.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>NO! Why this site?!?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Respect is a two-way street and respect cannot be demanded.\nWe try our hardest to respect privacy for the end-users and readers and in return, those people respect the privacy of the site-admin writing this.\nTo our readers and users around the world, we thank you for understanding this.</p>Lack of terms agreement user checkbox.<p>On many sites, you will find this infamous pop-up that will appear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I have read and agree to the terms \u2013 BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH GIVE ME YOUR DATA! \u2013 Evil corp website of the week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be blunt.\nNo one reads them.\nIn most cases they are unenforceable.\nAny website that wants to throw that in your face clearly is doing something nefarious where they want you the end-user to legally agree to something that they are doing such as collecting information upon you.\nWe would be willing to bet that the upper 90 percent of my readers don\u2019t even visit this page.\nSo why force anyone to agree to a ToS that is beholden to no one?</p>\n<p>Pop-ups are the disease of the internet and a waste of screen space.\nMoving on.</p>General Privacy Policy updates \u2013 Changes in Terms.<p>S-Config at the time didn\u2019t think it was that important to keep people notified on the changes of policies that occur on a blog.\nSo, as of 01/23/2021, We\u2019ll try to at least have a blog article explaining the changes/additions/removals of anything within our privacy agreement as a separate blog article.\nWe\u2019re trying to learn as much as everyone else on the net here.</p>Children\u2019s privacy.<p>Probably shouldn\u2019t have dropped all of those F-Bombs at the beginning huh?</p>\n<p>It all comes down to the children, doesn\u2019t it? The ultimate clutch of societal abandonment.\nPass your child onto the internet to entertain and raise huh? We\u2019re here to inform you that it is not our job to babysit your children because we shift that responsibility back onto the parent.</p>\n<p>S-Config believes in the privacy of <strong>ALL </strong>who visit here.\nNot just children! Therefore, to the parents reading this.\nIf your child visited a site like this without parental or legal guardian supervision.\nYou are a bad parent.\nWhat the hell are you doing? We do not collect information on your fragile little child you let play recklessly on the information super-highway you irresponsible monster of a legal guardian! If your child does contact us and gives us information explicitly stating that they are under age it will be instantly deleted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This website is designed for mature audiences.\n\u2013 S</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like other corporate shills online we could state that this website is only accessible for humans above the age of 13 to give an example.\nAs we have no capacity to enforce such measures it would be flat out lying to say that this website is restricted for audiences above/below a certain age group.</p>\n<p>With absolute privacy comes absolute control.\nBe careful on your journey.</p>COPPA compliance.<p>In the event that you are a government official who is incredibly dense and failed to read the first paragraph about children\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We collect no tracking information on <strong>ANYONE</strong> who visits s-config.com! \u2013 S</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We do not have a targeted or directed advertisement that involves the indexing of cookies that track our readers.\nThis site is for adults and while we may reference things that children may like such as animated cartoon characters.\nBy no means, we are offering children 13 and under any incentives for visiting this website.\nIf you do find tracking cookies please review the source of them <em>(probably Google for exit-link cookies because they are creeps.) </em>and respectfully pursue action against those parties.</p>California privacy rights.<p>To the legal snowflakes on the American west coast that want to flex harder than the EU.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A fuck you sandwich will be waiting for you here as well California! \u2013 S</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To those the readers who must know what the hell is up with this paragraph.\nCalifornia is a special state in America that feels they have to one-up every other state by inventing new laws out of thin air.\nOne of them demanding websites to declare that they do not sell the data of their users to third party marketing groups or providers.\nTo which no.\nThe data is not sold in any manner.\nThis makes our website cleaner than your own government who taxes you into obliteration and probably sells your data to third party marketing firms because the American government is a group of super hypocrites.</p>Information a visitor provides on this site.<p>We collect information only when the user provides said information to this site.\nThe information is given to us even if used as a form of documentation and is not enforced!

suspension, and moderation do not apply here.</p>Glossary of information types:<p>This is a quick run-down on some of the terminologies we will be using as the types of information that could be captured by using our site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Technical Data</strong> \u2013 This is in regard to the type of computer you are using such as Operating Systems, Browsers, and other features that may or may not be available for our website to use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Alias/Name</strong> \u2013 The name to which the end-user wishes to be referred to.\nKindly note that these can also be aliases and any name which has any real-life reference is purely coincidental.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>E-Mail</strong> \u2013 This is your electronic mailing address required during any form of communication.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Geo-Location</strong> \u2013 This is the location of the IP address assigned to you by your internet provider.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content</strong> \u2013 The body of text that the user submits to the server.</li>\n</ul>Points on this website were data is exchanged between end-user and site:<p>This proceeds to explain all of the entry and/or exit points on this site where data could be captured.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Leaving comments</strong> \u2013 <em>WordPress CORE function</em> \u2013 When a user leaves a comment we collect the comment the user provides.\nThe alias name to which they wish to go by.\nFinally, an E-Mail address which they are not required to provide or answer truthfully.\nThe E-Mail entry only exists if the end-user wishes to know if someone responded to their comment so they can be automatically notified.\nE-mails collected are not used for marketing purposes and are destroyed from the WordPress database 30 days after receiving the comment.\nA notice checkbox has been enforced after 05/25/2018 notifying them of what happens when they smash that submit button.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contact Us.</strong> \u2013 <em>WordPress WPforms Plugin</em> \u2013 All information such as the content, alias names, and e-mail addresses is all sent out of WordPress immediately upon submission and is collected at an E-Mail server for our review.\nNo active database of users contacting us resides on the WordPress framework at this time.\nAll E-mails are typically answered within 48 hours and will usually be deleted in 30 days after receiving them.\nAny E-Mail containing malicious or criminal activity will be forwarded to law enforcement immediately.\nNo physical mailing addresses to this server or FAX numbers will be posted as it\u2019s an unnecessary expense to have communications from the dark ages.\nA notice checkbox has also been enforced within the plugin informing the user of these changes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spam Protection</strong> \u2013 <em>WordPress Askimet Plugin</em> \u2013 As a necessary evil IP-based Geo-location and the content may be analyzed by a third party plugin in order to determine if the content that is being sent to our servers is legit.\nThis occurs when keywords that spammers use are triggered within the content of the text.\nIf determined as spam the content is then destroyed daily with extreme prejudice.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Website CORE logs</strong> \u2013 As it is common for every web-server installation to have logging enabled on our server which may contain technical data about your computer and Geo-Location of where a user exists within the world down to their internet node.\nThese logs are cycled out every three months and are used only for diagnostic and troubleshooting purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Locally stored cookies</strong> \u2013 <em>FooBox Galleries and ZoomSounds WordPress Plugins</em> \u2013 Some of our interactive JavaScript tools used for displaying pictures or playing music may generate a local storage cookie.\nThe data exchanged here checks display sizes of the browser and also keeps track of the play button is still active so the sound does not continue to play when least expected to.\nThese cookies are local only for s-config.com and are not shared with any third party sites of vendors.</li>\n</ul>How we use visitor information:<p>The only thing we care about is making sure that the website is running.\nThus, we will look at the Apache logs to see if there is anything going on that we should be made aware of.\nBeyond that, we do not use your information beyond the topics discussed on our site! In fact, we go out of our way in deleting things like E-mail addresses so that in the event of a major website hijack.</p>How we share user information:<p>Once collected how is the information distributed?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Public</strong> \u2013 Anything that the user comments on in a public blog is, you guessed it! Public! Fucking mind blown on that one huh?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal and the courts</strong> \u2013&nbsp.\nIf a search warrant within our country has been issued we will comply.\nCopyrights and Intellectual properties shall be handled on a case by case basis.\nIn general, the records of our database are not open to the public and unless there are some serious legal issues.\nYou do not have the right to see anything beyond what the average user sees.\nAs much as we would love to avoid going to court.\nWe will not stop any entity in the action of filing a lawsuit.\nWe will however defend ourselves in court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-Party Vendor</strong> \u2013 We do not require Third-Party intervention for the operation of this site.\nThus, we do not work with any at this time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong> \u2013 Going into crazy town.\nIf this site is transferred to another entity that entity shall receive full access to everything that is produced here.\na 30-day notification will be placed in the event that occurs.\nWe have the basic dignity to do at least that!</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Death</strong> \u2013 In the event of the real-life death of the operator, this site along with user interactions will be destroyed immediately by the data center which is hosting our server.\nAs it should.\nNo automatic transfer of ownership has been signed at the time of this article.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Export Rights</strong> \u2013 Due to the nature of how this site is operated.\nIt is impossible to have a data export request form as all commenters are presumably anonymous and using aliases.</li>\n</ul>Media that is served on this site.<p>S-Config.com believes in the notion of centralized content hosting to ensure the privacy of the readers.\nWe do serve a lot of content here! All of the content on this website has been generated by the group and none of the content hosted on S-Config has been made by an external source unless otherwise mentioned.\nEven if third-party content is served it will be properly vetted by a series of scripts and re-encoding methodologies that are designed to destroy any META/EXIF data that exists within.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Images Served</strong> \u2013 GIF, PNG,APNG, JPG, WEBP, AVIF are the formats served on this site.\nAll of them are passed through an optimization CRON job that improves the overall performance of the site while removing any META/EXIF content responsible for disclosing Geo-location data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Videos Served</strong> \u2013 OGV, WEBM is the format served on this site for motion video.\nMP4 has been decommissioned and removed from this site as it carries legal concerns over the usage of the format.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audio Served </strong>\u2013 OGG, WAV files are used to transfer audio-based information to the client.\nMetadata of the artist information is within these OGG files which does not violate the privacy of our readers.\nMP3 has been decommissioned and removed from this site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Binaries Served</strong> \u2013 Within some of our articles, there may be a 7-zip file that contains binaries.\nSome of them may be coming from a third-party source.\nAlways exercise caution when opening any binary from the net.\nAlthough we scanned all of our binaries with virus/mal-ware checking utilities and our VPS scans everything daily.\nYou can never be too safe.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>JavaScript Served</strong> \u2013 JS, JSON files are served to the end-user to behave as a graphical aesthetic for the site and not for the collection of data.\nAny data that it does collect such as display information is discarded shortly afterward.\nAll JS files are loaded within the domain to ensure there is no violation of privacy from a third party service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fonts Served \u2013</strong> EOT, SVG, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2 are all served locally from this site as well to ensure there is no violation of privacy from a third party service.\nAlso, in accordance to the owners of those fonts, the TOS ensures that we are legally able to host said fonts from this site.</li>\n</ul>Language of our notice.<p>It\u2019s English.\nSorry.\nWe\u2019re not a massive mega-corp that can afford translators and we have seen what happens to language when it\u2019s pushed through a robotic translator.\nAs cool as that would be to have perfect auto-translation.\nEven in 20A0, it\u2019s still sketchy at best.</p>Industry regulatory disclosure requirements.<p>We are required to disclose how insanely sexy we are.\nThanks for

been received via e-mail from people visiting both the new and old sites throughout the years and have been compiled and answered right here for you.</p>This will also be noted as the TOS or Terms of

well.\nThere are state governments who feel that even running a personal blog that we have to spell out for you what our <strong>\n<em>\u2018service\u2019</em>\n</strong> is because apparently, that\u2019s legally more detrimental to society than the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Running prison states with sanctioned slave labor.</li>\n<li>Permitting poison in the form of cigarettes and alcohol so long as it lines a senator\u2019s pockets with money!</li>\n<li>Mobster level taxation on marijuana while prohibiting people from growing their own.</li>\n<li>Manipulating the will of the people through every media outlet by lying with zero accountability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is probably why we stay away from politics on this site.\nEspecially to a particular part of the United States known as <em>\u201cGeorgia\u201d</em> that deserves a jackboot to the head.\nInventing these laws out of thin air because it\u2019s easy when there are no lobbyists to throw money at your election cycle

are questions pertaining to the general function and operation of the site itself.</p>\n<strong>Why does this site exist in the first place?</strong>\n<p>Over the years if there is one lesson to be taken from the internet.\nIt is the lesson about <strong>\n<em>\u201ccontrol.\u201d</em>\n</strong> And the notion that if you do not control your data and your website then you are simply giving control over to another entity.\nWhen control is given you are bitched.\nAlthough it is hosted on a web-provider this can be moved and/or taken down at any time.\nThis is more then what you can do on social media or art servers.\nThankfully, web-code is something that does not have to be developed from the ground-up anymore but CMS programs like WordPress, Joomla, etc and has made life a hell of a lot easier.</p>\n<strong>This site is harsh! Why don\u2019t you have any disclaimers?</strong>\n<p>What? Do you actually care about that?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Language \u2013 </strong>This site may include content and/or language that is of the mature audience and culture.\nIf you\u2019re twelve years old go watch Cartoon Network, Disney, or Nickelodeon.\nYou are simply not ready for the level of seething bitterness that oozes from this website.\nParents should be monitoring their children in the first place when it comes to the net and we will not be their babysitters.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Binaries \u2013 </strong>As a denizen of the net it is your responsibility that the binaries that you download contain no malicious code or data.\nIf at all possible this site will attempt to give direct links to the manufacturer or developer websites which are the best possible places to download them from.\nHowever, if you are downloading from a cloud or a third-party source such as this very site that please make sure that your anti-virus countermeasures are up to date.\nAlthough our site runs a daily ClamAV scan on the entire server.\nThis site will not be held liable for any or all damage that occurs from downloading anything from this site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Knowledge \u2013 </strong>This is&nbsp;provided on an <strong>\n<em>\u201cas-is\u201d</em>\n</strong> basis as we have no accreditation or certification proving any or all information on this site is correct.\nWe shall do the best we can to make sure it is accurate however accuracy cannot be guaranteed.\nWe shall not be held responsible for any personal injury, damage to property, mental anguish, butthurt, or malicious mischief caused by knowledge on this site</p>\n<p>Public service announcement complete.\nLet\u2019s move along, shall we?</p>\n<strong>You didn\u2019t approve of my comment!</strong>\n<p>If you were being offensive of link spamming then you get what you deserve.\nIf you are being civil your comment shall be approved and you may get a response.\nIn other words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don\u2019t be a tool! \u2013 S</p>\n</blockquote>Rage.<p>Also, starting off an e-mail to me by saying</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You\u2019re an idiot\u2026 \u2013 Rando Poster</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or\u2026</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fuck you S! \u2013 Rando Poster</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Comments like this will likely go to spam.\nRemember, you\u2019re trying to convince people like us to actually <em>\n<strong>READ</strong>\n</em> your responses.</p>\n<strong>Crazy long responses! Blog inception!</strong>\n<p>If you want to go on for paragraph after paragraph that cannot be approved either as it is another form of spam.\nKeep it short and sweet kids.\nHTTP linkage is heavily monitored because it appears on the site.\nWe know it\u2019s a way for people to grow their back-links.\nIf it\u2019s your honest to goodness personal web-page then there are no problems with that! However, we have been around the internet long enough to know the difference.\nYou\u2019re welcome to test that.</p>I NEED MONEY!<p>This is one of those topics that we feel like dicks for having to enforce.\nBecause we do know that the world is a tough place to live in.\nWe can\u2019t publish articles of people asking for donations.\nIt\u2019s not fair to the readers to be constantly asking for money in every article.\nEspecially in an environment where everyone is anonymous.\nWe cannot validate if the story you are telling is true or if your just some net drifter trying to scalp BTC\u2019s off of people.</p>\n<strong>You didn\u2019t respond to my e-mail about the problems with a support topic that you have on your site!</strong>\n<p>Support topics are posted just as a reference point.\nIf it helps people out then cool! If not well sorry to hear and hope that you find your answer.\nEveryone gets busy and sometimes responses can be heavily delayed.\nIt\u2019s nothing personal.\nIt\u2019s just the way it is! Also note that if we did not respond it\u2019s likely that we simply do not have a response to give.\nInstead, we will publish the comment and let others who are smarter attempt to answer.</p>\n<strong>Why do you have your subscription status disabled? I want to Subscribe to your site!</strong>\n<p>In a word?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u201cSpammers.\u201d</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Leaving the subscriber option open only invites spammers from coming into the WordPress tool and causing crap that is simply not needed.\nWant to complain about it in a post? That\u2019s cool.\nHowever, if it is following an out-of-country web-address that links to spam it\u2019s not going to appear here.\nAlso, speaking like a human being helps as well! We understand that the internet is a big place that expands beyond the reaches of our homeland.\nWe will know the difference between someone trying to talk to us using a translator and straight-up spam.</p>\n<p>Subscribing to be a registered user/editor here is closed to the public.</p>\n<strong>I want to put my link on your site.\nCan you do that for me?</strong>\n<p>Do you want to contact us for cross-linking? Mind the rules of the internet, post it on your site first and then it will be considered for a post here.\nIt will be posted in \u201cCellar Door\u201d as my respected list of sites.\nIf you do not feel that is adequate coverage then please remove my site for your listing then.\nPeople like this blog because it\u2019s clean.\nTo place banners all over the front of every page or place it into the static header/footer template is counterproductive.</p>\n<strong>I went to your download section and couldn\u2019t find a driver that was mentioned in one of your blogs.\nWhy?</strong>\n<p>Mostly because any drivers or binaries that are not directly owned by the site-admins here will not be in the downloads section.\nIf you are looking for a driver or a .apk that is referenced in one of my blogs all of my blogs will have links going off to those attachments.</p>\n<strong>What does this website run on?</strong>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Love.\n-S</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What?

Because this is a web 1.0 site we mockingly choose the .com domain prefix because of an old Netscape domain resolution bug from the late \u201990s that never to this day got resolved.\nIf you type in a person\u2019s site the first this it will look up alphabetically is.COM\u2019s over every other domain category.\nWe also prefer.COM address because stating \u201c.ORG\u201d is a little bizarre and makes us feel like a hippy non-profit group.\nAnd .NET refers to the notion that this is a network that is incorrect.\nAlso, having a .COM site opens the doors for future sales.\nBut at this time this is a free blog site.</p>Why do you have a .onion site?!?
