automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is a text file that websites send to a visitor\u2019s computer or other Internet-connected deviceto uniquely identify the visitor\u2019s browser or to store information or settings inthe browser.\nA \u201cweb beacon,\u201d also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, is used to transmit information back to a web server.\nOur emails may also contain web beacons.</p>\n<p>We also may use third-party website analytics tools (such as Omniture and Google Analytics), that collect information about visitor
