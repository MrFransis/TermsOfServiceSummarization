Marketing <p>We and our Suppliers may implement and evaluate our marketing activities and programs, including to engage in targeted and personalized online advertising on the Services, on third-party websites, mobile apps, TV, or other online or offline services operated by third parties.\nThis marketing may be targeted to you based on Personal Information or Other Information collected over time, such as through your participation in the Programs, your activity on the Services, your device\u2019s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude), your activity on unaffiliated third-party sites, mobile apps, or other online services, other marketing activities and Programs, and/or from third parties with whom we work.\nWe and our Suppliers, including Facebook, may use Tracking Technologies (as described under \"Usage Information\" above) to collect information for such marketing and evaluation purposes.\nFor example, our Suppliers may use the fact that you visited the Panera website to deliver ads to you on non-Panera websites, or they may use the fact that you used the Panera mobile app to deliver ads to you on non-Panera mobile apps.\nWe and our Suppliers may also identify whether our marketing activities and programs resulted in you engaging in other activities on our Services, our advertising and/or marketing, making purchases from us and/or our franchisees, visiting bakery cafes, or otherwise engaging with us.\nIn addition, we and our Suppliers may target Panera ads to you on your TV or other online services if we or our Supplier have identified you as a Panera customer using information we share with them, such as your name, email address, or mailing address.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Cross-Device Technologies <p>We and our Suppliers may use collected information to establish connections among related web browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs) for targeted advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.\nWe and/or our Suppliers may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household.\nThis means that your online behavior (information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device and your device\u2019s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude)) may be combined with information collected from your other browsers or devices.\nFor example, our Suppliers may use this information to deliver an ad on your tablet or smartphone, to limit the number of times you see an ad across your devices, and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns across devices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Location <p>We and/or our Suppliers may collect the geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude) of your mobile device based upon information identified by your mobile device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, beacons, Bluetooth and/or near field communication protocols.\nWe may use and share your mobile device\u2019s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude) together with Personal Information or Other Information to identify your local bakery-cafe, to provide you with personalized messaging or content (for example, that you have a MyPanera reward available) and/or for marketing purposes by email, push notification, online or in-app advertising, or by other means, as described in \"Targeted Marketing\" above and/or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.\nSee \"Opt-Out Choices\" below for information on how to opt-out of location collection.\nIf you choose to opt-out of location collection, certain functionality of our Services may not be available to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Opt-Out Choices <p>You may opt out of certain of our or our Suppliers' targeted marketing practices in web browsers and mobile applications by following the instructions below.\nPlease note that you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices, as each opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.\nIf you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again.\nNote that some Suppliers may also make their own opt-out process available.\nPlease note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising about Panera.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Web Browser Opt-Out</b>.\nTo opt out in web browsers, please visit the Network
