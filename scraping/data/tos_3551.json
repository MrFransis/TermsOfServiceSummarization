perform a currency conversion in order to refund or reverse the transaction, subject to the exchange rate being offered by Wise in the applicable currencies at that time.\n&nbsp;For details about what happens if your Wise Account balance becomes negative, please see Negative Account Balances below.</p>\n<strong>Payments that are reversed</strong>\n<p>Payments to you may be invalidated and reversed

reason.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Chargeback Fees</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you receive a debit or credit card-funded payment through your Wise Account and you (or a third party) pursue a chargeback for the

funds held in a Jar.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Negative Account Balances</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If your Wise Account balance becomes negative for any reason, including on account of a Reversal or Chargeback, that

you receive into your Wise Account including funds held in a Jar..\nIf you manage your balance in your Wise Account in multiple currencies, and the balance in one of the currencies becomes negative

exchange rate being offered by Wise in the applicable currencies at that time.\nWe may send you reminders or take such other reasonable actions to recover the negative balance from you, for example, we may use a debt collection service or take further legal actions.\n&nbsp;In order to recover negative account balances from you, we may convert the amount you owe us into U.S

generally includes two types of orders:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Fixed Target Payment Orders</strong>,\nwhere you instruct us to transfer a specific amount of foreign currency (not U.S.\ndollars) to a

investigate any suspicious activity or in response to any complaints or reported violations.\nWhen investigating any such activity, we reserve the right to report suspected unlawful activity to any appropriate regulatory or similar authority or person and to provide such authority or person any relevant information, including personal data.\n</p>\nMore specifically, you are not allowed to use our Services\"\n<ul>\n<li>in connection with the sale or distribution of any prohibited or illegal good or service or an activity that requires a governmental license where you lack such a

detect multiple active registrations for a single user, we reserve the right to merge or terminate the registrations and refuse you all continued use of the Service without notification to you.\n</p>\n9.\nPayment Methods\n<p>\nWe only accept payment for your transfer via ACH Pull Direct Debit, or, if you choose to initiate the transfer of funds from Your Bank Account, an ACH Push or domestic Wire Transfer.\nNo other payment methods are accepted, including cash, mailed check, or electronic check.\n</p>\n9.1 Payment by ACH Pull Direct Debit\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you choose to pay for your transfer using our ACH Pull direct debit feature, you will need to provide your bank account details, including your bank account number and routing number (each such bank account is deemed <strong>\u201cYour Bank Account\u201d</strong>).\n</li>\n<li>\nWhen you choose to pay for your transfer using our ACH Pull direct debit feature and provide Your Bank Account details, you represent that Your Bank Account payment details are correct, that you are authorized to access and transmit funds from Your Bank Account, that Your Bank Account is in good standing with the account-holding financial institution, and that you have the authority to initiate an electronic funds transfer in the amount at issue to or from Your Bank Account.\n</li>\n<li>\nWhen you choose to pay for your transfer using our ACH Pull direct debit feature and by providing Your Bank Account details and requesting a Transaction, you authorize us to initiate electronic credits and debits to Your Bank Account through the automated clearinghouse (ACH) network in order to process the requested Transaction, including any applicable fees and charges.\n</li>\n<li>Your authorization shall remain in effect for any Transaction that you have authorized while a registered user with the Service unless canceled in accordance with this Agreement.\n</li>\n</ul>\n9.2 Payment by Wire or ACH Push\n<ul>\n<li>\nIf you choose to pay for your transfer using the ACH Push or domestic wire transfer method, then your payment order will remain inactive until we receive your funds (the \u201cDeposit Payment\u201d) to our specified account.\n</li>\n<li>\nDeposit Payments must be made to our specified account via ACH Push or domestic wire transfer.\nIf for any reason your Transaction is cancelled or refused, then we will promptly return the deposit to the account from which it originated.\nIn the event that we are unable to return the deposit, then we will promptly contact you using the most current contact information provided to us by you through your Wise registration.\n</li>\n</ul>\n10.\nExchange Rates\n<ol>\n<li>\nThe \u201c<strong>Transaction Amount</strong>\u201d is the amount that you send from Your Bank Account in an ACH Pull Transaction or the Deposit Payment in an ACH Push or wire transfer, minus any applicable fees and prior to any foreign exchange conversion.\n</li>\n<li>Locked-In Exchange Rates.\nWe always specify the exchange rate applicable to your Transaction at the time you submit your requested Transaction, and this exchange rate will be locked-in (the \u201c<strong>Locked-In Exchange Rate</strong>\u201d) for a period of 24 hours from the time you initiate your payment (the \u201c<strong>Specified Period</strong>\u201d).\nWe will convert the Transaction Amount at the Locked-In Exchange Rate, provided that your Transaction Amount reaches our specified bank account within the Specified Period.\n</li>\n<li>Unlocked Exchange Rates.\nIf the Transaction Amount reaches our specified bank account after the Specified Period, we will convert your funds at the <strong>Unlocked Exchange Rate</strong>, as defined below, which means that the exchange rate could be higher or lower than the Locked-In Exchange Rate.\n<ol>\n<li>\nWe, through Wise, make reasonable efforts to align Unlocked Exchange Rates with the mid-market rate in global currency markets at the time of conversion.\nWise relies on aggregated third party information sources (including exchange rates under license from XE.COM Inc.\n[\u201cXE\u201d, http://www.xe.com/]), and we do not guarantee that the rates match any particular benchmark source at any given time.\nWe are not liable if the amount received by the Recipient is less than anticipated as a result of changes in the global currency markets.\n</li>\n<li>\nIn order to protect you from negative volatility in the global foreign exchange markets, we automatically apply a 3% rate limit (the \u201c<strong>Automatic Rate Limit</strong>\u201d).\nThis means that in the event that the conversion rate moves negatively (to your detriment) beyond the Automatic Rate Limit, then we will temporarily stop any further conversion until market conditions improve.\nWe will notify you if the situation does not improve for more than 24 hours.\n</li>\n<li>\nAny rate limits will only apply to limit negative rate movements.\nWe will always pass on any improvements in exchange rates for Unlocked Exchange Rate transactions.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\nNeither we nor any of our service providers take any margin or spread on the exchange rate associated with your Transaction.\nhence, there are no buy and sell rates.\nThe rate that you receive is exactly the same rate as your counterparty.\nThe only fees you pay us for the Service are the Transaction Fees and Administration Fees described in Section 13 of this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li>\nFor the avoidance of doubt, we do not currently offer the ability to make recurring payments or forward contracts as part of our Services.\n</li>\n</ol>\n11 .Transaction History\n<p>\nYou can access the details of all your Transactions and other information relating to your use of the Service by logging into the Service Website (at www.wise.com/usa?) and selecting an option from navigation bar called \u201cTransfers\u201d.\n</p>\n12.\nRefused Transactions\n<p>\nWe reserve the right in our sole discretion to refuse any Transaction.\nReasons for refusal may include but are not limited to an inability to match your registration information with your bank account details, incorrect Recipient details or an insufficient deposit amount.\nWe generally will attempt to notify of you of any refusal, using the contact information provided as part of your registration, stating (where possible) the reasons for the refusal and whether the problem can be corrected.\nWe will not notify you of a refusal where to do so would be unlawful.\n</p>\n13.\nCancellation of Transactions\n<p>\nYou may cancel your Transaction for a full refund (a) within 30 minutes of authorizing your Transaction or (b) at any time thereafter if the Transaction Amount has not yet been converted in accordance with your order.\n</p>\n14.\nFees\n<ol>\n<li>Transaction Fees.\nWe charge a fee on every Transaction.\nFees relating to the Transaction are fully visible to you before you accept the Transaction.\nFurther information on our fees are published on the Service Website (https://wise.com/support/customer/portal/articles/1923639-pricing-for-transfers-from-usd).\nThe Transaction Fee is deducted from the Transaction Amount prior to conversion.\nTransaction Fees do not include any fees that your bank or the Recipient\u2019s bank may charge.\nThose fees may be deducted from your deposit (in the case of your bank) or the delivered amount (in the case of Recipient\u2019s bank).\n</li>\n<li>\nAdministration Fee.\nAn Administration Fee may be incurred when your Transaction is refused due to incorrect payment details, regulatory requirements or any other reason.\n(This fee is in addition to any amount your bank or the Recipient\u2019s bank may assess.) Any Administration Fee will be deducted from your Transaction Amount.\nOur current Administration Fee for Refused Transactions is 8.00 USD per Transaction.\n</li>\n</ol>\n15.\nService Providers\n<p>\nWe use agents and service providers to help us deliver the Service to you.\nFor example, Wise manages the Service on our behalf as our service provider.\nAmong other functions, Wise provides customer service and other functions and arranges delivery of funds to Recipient abroad.\nWise is registered in the United Kingdom as a money service business by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and is a licensed Payments Institution under the prudential supervision of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nRegardless, all services provided by Wise or other agents or service providers are performed at our direction and subject to our supervision and control.\n</p>\n16.\nErrors and Compromised User Credentials\n<p>\nOnce Transactions have been executed, they cannot be reversed, and, except as expressly set out in this Agreement, we will not be liable in any way for any loss you suffer as a result of a Transaction being carried out in accordance with your instructions.\n<strong>If you believe there to be an error in connection with a Transaction or other problem as set out in this Section 15, then you should notify Wise Support through our Help Center or 1-888-908-3833.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nIf you think there has been an error or problem with your transfer, you must contact Wise Support no later than 180 days of the date we promised to you that the funds would be made available to the Recipient.\nWhen you do, please tell us as much of the following information as possible: (1) Your name and address.\n(2) The error or problem with the transfer, and why you believe it is an error or problem.\n(3) The name of the person receiving the funds, and if you know it, his or her telephone number or address.\n(4) The dollar amount of the transfer.\nand (5) The confirmation code or number of the transaction.\n</li>\n<li>\nThe law generally requires us to investigate and determine whether an error occurred within 45 days after you contact us, but typically we will conduct this investigation and make a determination within ten business days.\nWe will inform you of our determination within three business days after completing our investigation.\nIf we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of any documents we used in our investigation.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf your Transaction history shows Transactions that you did not initiate, please contact Wise Support at once to let us know.\nWise Support must hear from you no later than sixty days after the date we make available to you the periodic statement in which the error appears.\nIf you do not tell Wise Support, you may not get back any of the money you lost after the 60 days, if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money had you told us in time.\n</li>\n<li>\nTell Wise Support at ONCE if you believe your user credentials have been compromised.\nTelephoning is the best way of keeping any losses to a minimum.\nCompromise of your credentials could allow thieves to access Your Bank Account to make unauthorized payments.\nIf you notify Wise Support within two Business Days, you can lose no more than $50 if someone uses your use credentials without your permission.\nIf you do NOT tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the compromise of your credentials, and we can prove we could have stopped someone from using your credentials without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we may extend the time periods set out in this Section 15.\n</li>\n</ol>\n17.\n\u201cBusiness Day\"\n<p>\n\u201cBusiness Day\" for purposes of this Agreement means any

arising from your misuse or inability to use the Service Website, whether due to reasons within our control or not.\n</li>\n<li>For losses or damage to you from our inability to complete a Transaction

taken.\n</li>\n</ul>\n19.\nDisclaimer of Liability\n<p>IN PROVIDING THE SERVICE TO YOU, NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES, HOLDING COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS,
