Creator\u2019s behalf.\nFailure for a Creator ,to maintain a node directly, or through a designated ContentOperatorcould result in loss of Content ,ownership, Content being marked as unverified (making such Content undiscoverable), and loss of revenue ,during downtime.\nFor more information on the technical specifications of Creator nodes, see Section 11 of ,the White Paper.,6.NODE OPERATORS,Audius allows Users that wish to contribute to the Platform as ContentNode Operatorsto build and operate ,proprietary decentralized storage protocols atop existing decentralized storage projects (\u201cContentNode\u201d) in ,order to allow Creators and/or Listeners to store/cache and share/access Content via the Platform.\nAudius ,also allows Users that wish to contribute to the Platform as Discovery Node Operatorsto build content ,discovery service protocols (\u201cDiscovery Node\u201d) that allow Users to effectively and efficiently search for and ,discover/categorize Content on the Platform.\nEach User that decides to build and operate a Content Node ,or Discovery Node agrees that such Content Node and/or Discovery Node, as well as anyrelated storage and ,delivery protocols associated therewith, will be built to the highest and most current industry standards, ,scale effectively as Platform demand increases and provide an equivalent User experience when compared ,to existing centralized solutions..,Each Node Operator agrees that the Platform is a decentralized network and as such Audius is not responsible ,or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, ,profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted or transferred by you, other Users, or third parties on the ,Platform.\n,Each Node Operator agrees that it will become a registered agent under Section 512 of the DMCA (defined ,below) and maintain such registered agent status while it remains a Node Operator.\nEach Node Operator ,further agrees that it will take prompt action to respond to any andall notices setting forth allegations of ,copyright infringement related to or arising from Content which it hashosted and served to Listeners on the ,Platform.\nIn connection with the foregoing, each Node Operatorsetting up a Node Operator Account will be ,required to include an email address pursuant to which such Node Operator can be notified of any allegations ,of copyright infringement related to or arising from Content which such Node Operator has hosted or served ,to Listeners on the Platform.In the event that you receive a notice from Audius or a third party API that ,there is infringing Content on your Content Node, you agree to promptly delist such infringing Content from ,being made available on the Platform.,Discovery Node Operators,Discovery Node Operators shall be permitted to build and register a Discovery Interface (defined below) or a ,Discovery Service that extends or modifies the core API and indexes metadata of the Content that can be ,efficiently queried by Users, subject to meeting the requirements in this section.\nEach Discovery Node ,Operator(whether operating a Discovery Interface or Discovery Service) acknowledges and agrees that it ,shall also be bound by, and remain complaint with, those rules, requirements, guidelines, restrictions, and ,procedures set forth in the White Paper and Guidelines.,A Discovery Node Operator may register and operate a Discovery Node by staking a set number of Audius ,tokens, denoted B.\nUpon registration of a Discovery Node, each Discovery Node Operator shall register ,DP,which discovery API interface they are operating, geographic coordinates, and one or more endpoints for ,reaching their Discovery Node.\nA Discovery Node Operator may request to delist their Discovery Node to ,unlock the initially staked Audius tokens.\nIf a Discovery Node Operator\u2019s staked token balance declines below ,B, such Discovery Node Operator will be automatically delisted, and their remaining balance of tokens will ,DP,be refunded.,The Platform will allow Users to select any discovery API interface that is available on the Platform.\nThe ,Company has developed a first-party discovery API interface to assist Users with discovering Content on the ,Platform.\nCompany also encourages Users, in the capacity as a Discovery Node Operator,to author their own ,interfaces.,Each Discovery Interface or Discovery Node developed by a Node Operator must index new blocks from the ,Blockchain Protocol atomically (i.e., all-or-nothing), and all API methods must be deterministic.\nBecause of ,these requirements, for a given block hash, all Discovery Nodes running a given API interface will produce ,identical results for the same query.,Content Node Operators,To ensure democratic participation and accessibility for all Users of the Platform, ContentNode Operators,agree to make Content accessible through the Platform to Listeners in a manner that enables such Content ,to be highly available, independently verifiable, and decentralized.\nCreators sharing their Content, Listeners ,retrieving Content, and ContentNode Operatorswill all share longer-form information via this protocol, while ,references to files in this protocol will reside in the Platform.,ContentNode Operatorsagree to provide their services through the Audius Storage Protocol (\u201cAudSP\u201d), a ,decentralized storage solution for the Platform built on Inter-Planetary File System (\u201cIPFS\u201d).\nIPFS enables ,modular object-level encryption, global distribution capability, secure content addressing, and object ,immutability.\nIn order to encourage high availability for files stored through the Platform, Company may, in ,its sole discretion, provide an incentive structure for Users to host network content as ContentNode ,Operators.\nContentNode Operatorsthat host Content, subject to the requirements below, may earn revenue ,for hosting, storing and streaming Content for/to Users.,ContentNode Operatorsshall design and implement their respective Content Services such that a Listener\u2019s ,software via the Platform will identify an appropriate Content Service (or node) by querying which IPFS nodes ,have pinned the segment and cross-reference this set of nodes with the list of known content services.,EachContentNode Operatoracknowledges and agrees that it shall also be bound by, and remain complaint ,with, those rules, requirements, guidelines, restrictions, and procedures set forth in the White Paper and ,Guidelines.,YOU USE THE AudSPAT YOUR OWN RISK AND AGREE THAT THE PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d.\nAUDIUS ,MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR

registered Users are free to collaborate and share the world\u2019s ,music.\nThe decentralized protocol on the Platform, whereby Creators, Listeners and Node Operators, will be ,individually and collectively enfranchised in decision making about Platform changes and upgrades is ,hereinafter referred to as the \u201cGovernance System\u201d.\nThe terms set forth and voting rights described in this ,Section 7 are solely applicable to registered Users with an active Account at the time an applicable proposal ,is submitted for a vote.A User will be entitled to one (1) vote per Audius token staked for each proposal.,Upgrades to the Platform may be submitted by Users, including deployed code when necessary, to an ,overarching governance system that has custody over all other systems that make up the Platform (\u201cUpgrade ,Proposal\u201d).\nUsers must include in any Upgrade Proposal a block count at which point such upgrade goes into ,effect (\u201cUpgrade Proposal Effective Date\u201d).\nsuch effectiveness date shall be a minimum one (1) weekfrom ,the date of submission.,Prior to submitting an Upgrade Proposal, a User will be required to bond a set number of Audius Tokens in ,the Governance System, which may be withdrawn if such User chooses to withdraw the accompanying ,Upgrade Proposal prior to the Upgrade Proposal Effective Date.,Voting Process,Prior to the Upgrade Proposal Effective Date, Users may submit a binary yes or no vote on it.\nThe magnitude ,of a vote by a User is determined based on the magnitude of such User\u2019s membership in governance decision-,making classes and the corresponding voting power assigned to those classes.\nIf a User has earnings and/or ,holdings that fall into multiple classes, their vote can be counted in multiple classes.,Users are also permitted to delegate their vote to other Users or groups of Users, such that if a User chooses ,not to vote on a specific Upgrade Proposal, their designated delegate\u2019s vote will be used in place of their ,own.\nFor information on vote delegation, please see the immediately following subsection.,Initially, two groups will be designated as default delegates: (1) Audius Decentralized Autonomous ,Organization (DAO), which will be controlled by a small group of geographically distributed Node Operators.\n,and (2) Artist Advisory DAO, which will be controlled by Creators and Listeners.,Audius DAO shall be controlled by Node Operators and decisions will bemade by supermajority consensus ,of Audius DAO members.\nThe Audius DAO will be delegated voting power by default at the time of ,registration by a Node Operator for staked Audius Tokens.\nNode Operators may also affirmatively choose to ,delegate voting power to another User or group of their choosing.,The Artist Advisory DAO shall be controlled by Creators and Listeners, with the initial member chosen by ,Audius.\nMembers of the Artist Advisory DAO shall vote on each Upgrade Proposal, as well as the admission ,of new members of the DAO.\nAt the time of registration by a Creator or Listener the Artist Advisory DAO will ,be delegated voting power by default, which delegation may be changed or removed at the User\u2019s discretion.\n,Any other group of Users may federate to form their own voting DAO, as well.,8.PUBLICINFORMATION.\nINTERACTION WITH OTHER USERS,You acknowledge and
