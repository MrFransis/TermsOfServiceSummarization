2019\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> This Policy sets out the different scenarios in which InMobi Pte.\nLtd.\n(or its affiliates) may use cookies and web beacons (collectively the \u201c <strong>Cookies</strong>\u201d) to automatically collect certain information about you.\nCookies are small text files typically containing a sequence of numbers and letters that websites and/or applications serve to your desktop, smart device and/or mobile browser.\nThey are often used to provide a personalized experience to visitors/users as well as to provide reporting information regarding user\u2019s activity or how users are engaging with the websites and applications.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scenario 1 </strong> (INMOBI WEBSITE) \u2013 When you visit the InMobi website, we use cookies and web beacons to automatically collect certain information about your visit to the website and interaction with the same.\nWe use cookies to generally enable our systems to recognize users, to identify how and when pages within the InMobi website are visited and by how many people.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 1:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> This enables us to understand which parts of our website are of greatest interest to our visitors, as well as to understand certain aggregated geographic and demographic information about our visitors.\nWe use this information to continuously improve our website, monitor and analyze web traffic.\n</p>\n<p> Specifically, we use the following types of cookies on our website:\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Types of cookie </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who serves these cookies </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What they do </strong>\n</p>\n<p> Essential website cookies </p>\n<p> InMobi.com <br>\n</p>\n<p> Azure </p>\n<p> These cookies are necessary to provide you with services available through this website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.\nWithout these cookies, services you have asked for, like secure client account pages, would not be possible.\n</p>\n<p> Performance and functionality cookies </p>\n<p> InMobi.com </p>\n<p> Hubspot </p>\n<p> These cookies enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to its use.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality (like search functionality) may become unavailable.\n</p>\n<p> Analytics web beacons and customisation cookies </p>\n<p> Google Analytics (click here to opt out) </p>\n<p> Kickfire </p>\n<p> These technologies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how the website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the website for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OPTING OUT</strong>\n</p>\n<p> By using the InMobi website, you consent to the use of these cookies.\nIf you do not like the idea of cookies or certain types of cookies/beacons, you can change your browser\u2019s settings to delete cookies that have already been set and to not accept new cookies.\nTo learn more about how to do this, visit the help pages of your browser.\nPlease however note, that, if you delete cookies or do not accept them, you might not be able to use all of the features we offer, you may not be able to store your preferences, and some of our pages might not display properly.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scenario 2</strong> (TRACKING AND ADVERTISING COOKIES) \u2013 As a provider of advertising services, InMobi partners with many advertising clients who facilitate embedding/firing/placing of InMobi cookies or pixels on their websites for improving the advertising services.\nIn this scenario, InMobi cookies are third-party cookies.\nWe use these types of technologies to provide advertisements that are more relevant to your interests.\nThis can be done by delivering online adverts based on your web browsing activity on the InMobi website, known as \u201conline behavioral advertising\u201d (OBA).\nCookies are placed on your browser, which will remember the web pages you have visited on the InMobi website.\nAdvertisements linked to what you have been looking at may be displayed to you when you visit websites who use partner advertising networks.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 2</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Cookies are categorized as third-party or first-party depending on whether they are associated with the domain of the site.\nPermitting InMobi to embed/place its cookies or pixels, helps advertising clients and InMobi to know, which user visited which website and when, so that they can retarget or show advertisements that are likely to be relevant to such users.\nTypically, InMobi collects data related to your interaction with such advertising sites, products/services like whether the user visited the home page or product display page or added anything to cart or type of browser or operating system etc.\nWe would like to assure you that we do not know your identity, your name, your address, date of birth, social security number, credit card/financial information, email address or phone number.\nWe may share your data with our affiliates or partners for the purpose of improving advertising services and/or internal analytics in compliance with applicable laws and relevant commercial agreements.\nYour data may be stored by third parties like data enrichment partners, and data-centers providers in connection with the provision of services to us.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We recommend you to refer the respective privacy policies of the sites you visit or use.\nHowever, please note that if you delete/clear cookies or do not accept them, our services may be disrupted and we may not be able to serve you with relevant advertising.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Scenario 3 - </strong>(INMOBI AD NETWORK AND CHANNELS) - As a provider of advertising services, InMobi may partner with publishers to distribute advertisements of InMobi\u2019s advertising clients on such publishers\u2019 mobile websites.\nArticle 3 is to be read with our Privacy Policy set out in http://inmobi.com/privacy-policy/, provides the details in this regard.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 3 </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We use cookies for analyzing the usage and for tracking the advertisement serving process.\nThe cookies we serve enable us to collect information about how users interact with our partners' websites so that we can better customize the advertisements we serve and avoid serving advertisements that the user has already seen or is not interested in.\n</p>\n<p> We also use cookies to collect certain reporting information about the ads we serve, such as the type of device on which they were viewed, the geographies where they were viewed, the format of the ad displayed (such as text or image format) and so on.\nFor more information, please see our InMobi Ad Network Privacy Policy .\n</p>\n<p> This may include events related to your activity on our partner\u2019s mobile website or events related to the InMobi serving activity such as the number of advertisements served to you by InMobi.\nCookies or pixels enable us to keep a record of the publisher site you were using when you were shown an advertisement by InMobi or interacted with such an advertisement, analyze trends, and understand users\u2019 interests with respect to such mobile websites.\nWe would like to assure you that we do not know your identity, your name, your address, date of birth, social security number, credit card/financial information, email address or phone number.\n</p>\n<p> Our partners may also place cookies on the websites you visit.\nTheir use is governed by the specific privacy policies of such partners which can be accessed directly from their mobile websites.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OPTING OUT
