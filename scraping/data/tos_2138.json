third parties, or both may require you to purchase a subscription for a period of time as specified during sign-up (collectively a \u201cSubscription\u201d).\nYour Subscription, which may start with a thirty (30) day free trial period, will automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis (as specified during your sign-up) unless you cancel your Subscription as provided in Sections 3(e) and 3(g), or we terminate your Subscription as provided in Section 18.</p>\n<p> (b) <em>Bundles</em>.\nTIDAL may contract with a third party telecommunication provider to provide the Services to you through a bundle package together with other services provided by such third party provider.\nThe payment terms for such bundle package, as well as other terms and conditions governing your use of the bundle package, may differ from the terms set out in this Agreement.\nYou are responsible for reviewing such bundle terms or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your telecommunication provider before agreeing to any bundle package and accessing the Service via such bundle package.\nIf you have purchased a bundle package, payment will be taken from you by your

from your telecommunication provider or any other third party.</p>\n<p> (c) <em>Promotion/Trials.</em> TIDAL, vendors, or other third parties with whom we contract to provide the Services may offer special promotions/trials with differing conditions and limitations which may be subject to different terms from these Terms.\nAny additional terms to these Terms will be disclosed at sign-up or in other communications made available to you prior to sign-up.\nYou are responsible for reviewing any additional terms governing your use of such special promotions or trials before accessing any special promotions or trials.\nAt the end of the free or promotional trial period, your subscription will automatically renew for further rolling subscription periods of such duration as set out in the product details when you signed up for the trial or promotion and you will start to pay for the subscription.\nTo avoid any charges, you must cancel before the end of the free trial.\nYou are entitled to only one free trial per lifetime.\nAny attempt to utilize more than one free trial is an unauthorized use of the Services and/or Service Content and amounts to a breach of the Agreement.\nIf TIDAL determines, in its absolute discretion, that you have utilized more than one free trial, TIDAL reserves the right to terminate your access to the Services, Service Content, and/or the Agreement.</p>\n<p> (d) <em>Shopping in the store.</em> It is not necessary to buy a Subscription to make a purchase at the TIDAL Store.\nTo make a store purchase, you'll be prompted to sign in to

conditions, including any fees, imposed by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier, as applicable.\nYou are solely responsible for reviewing the terms of use, Privacy Policy or any other terms governing your use of the services provided by your financial services provider and/or mobile carrier.\nBy providing a Payment Method in connection with any Subscription, you hereby authorize TIDAL to debit the total cost of said Subscription and agree to be responsible for any foreign transaction charges associated with your Subscription purchase.\nShould charges for which you are responsible fail at the time payment is required, you may be responsible for costs associated with TIDAL\u2019s efforts to collect amounts due in accordance with applicable laws.\nYou confirm and promise to us that all information you provide in connection with the purchase of a Subscription is true, accurate and complete.\nThe duration and cost of Subscriptions are set by TIDAL in its sole discretion.\nWhen you purchase a Subscription, you will initially be charged at the rate applicable at the time of your initial agreement to subscribe.\nIf the price of the Subscription increases later, we will provide you with written notice before the end of the billing period in which the change is made.\nIf you do not accept the change to your Subscription, you will be entitled to terminate this Agreement.</p>\n<p> (f) <em>Billing Cycle</em>.\nAs indicated during sign-up, the fee for certain Subscriptions must be paid in a single upfront payment while other Subscriptions may allow payment on an installment basis.\nIf the Subscription fee is paid in a single upfront payment, the total Subscription fee is due and payable to TIDAL immediately upon sale and your Payment Method will be automatically billed at that time.\nIf the Subscription fee is paid on an installment basis, your Payment Method will automatically be billed at the beginning of each installment period as specified during sign-up.</p>\n<p> (g) <em>Automatic Renewal</em>.\nIn order to provide continuous service, you agree that TIDAL will automatically renew a Subscription on or about the date the Subscription expires.\nSuch renewal will be for the same duration of the original subscription term and will be billed at the non-discounted rate for the Subscription as of the date of your enrollment and according to your original billing cycle method (i.e.\neither as a single upfront payment or an installment basis).\nBy enrolling in a Subscription, you agree that your Subscription will be subject to the above-described automatic renewals unless you cancel your Subscription in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\nYou also agree that the amount billed may be different if your original Subscription was purchased using a promotional/trial offer and you authorize TIDAL to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts as indicated at the time of sign-up.\nYou agree that you are responsible for other charges, including any foreign transaction charges, that may be imposed by credit card providers, payment processors or other third parties in connection with your use of the Subscription.\nYour Subscription will remain in effect and continue to renew automatically until it is cancelled.</p>\n<p>IF YOUR ACCOUNT IS MANAGED THROUGH TIDAL (AND NOT THROUGH A THIRD PARTY) AND YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR AUTOMATIC SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL, you may do so by visiting your account settings page (https://tidal.com/account), going to the section called \u201cSubscription\u201d and clicking on \u201cCancel my subscription\u201d.\nTIDAL will make reasonable efforts to process cancellation requests within two business days from the receipt of the cancellation request.\nAll other cancellations are required to be made directly through the third party that manages your TIDAL Subscription.\n</p>\n<p> (h) <em>Refund Policy</em>.\nWe will not refund any fees paid to us, including any advance charge(s) or payment(s) for any subscription term for the Services, unless otherwise required by law or the terms of this Agreement.</p>\n<p> (i) <em>Charge Backs</em>.\nIf you dispute Subscription charges with your credit card company or financial institution, and TIDAL\u2019s investigation determines the charges were valid, we may, on reasonable written notice to you, charge to your TIDAL account the reasonable required cost of responding to your charge back request.\nTIDAL\u2019s Privacy Policy details what information TIDAL may share with your financial institution as part of the investigation into disputed Subscription charges.</p>\n<p>(j) <em>Statutory Right to Cancel.</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a consumer resident in the European Union, then you may also have the right to cancel your Subscription without giving any reason, and ask for a refund within 14 (fourteen) days of purchasing such Subscription.\nHowever, as explained below, this right is lost as soon as you download, stream, access or use any of the Service Content, or use any of the Services.</p>\n<p>To cancel your Subscription in accordance with this section, you must inform us of your decision to cancel.\nYou can contact us by sending an e-mail to support@tidal.com.\nPlease make sure that you include the details of your subscription purchase so that we can identify it.</p>\n<p>If you validly
