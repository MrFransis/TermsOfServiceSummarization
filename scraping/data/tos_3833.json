law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.\n- See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p> According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: <p>Users can visit our

enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children\u2019s privacy and safety online.</p>\n<p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p> Fair Information Practices <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role

laws that protect personal information.</p>\n<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:\nWe will notify the

requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p> CAN SPAM Act <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
