Hamburg.<br>\n<br>\n<b>\n<u>Ranking of Content</u>\n</b>\n<br>Here, we have provided information on the ranking of content.\nReturn to top 1.\nThe services we provide Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.\nTo help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you: Provide a personalized experience for you: Your experience on Facebook is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, events, ads, and other content you see in News Feed or our video platform to the Pages you follow and other features you might use, such as Trending, Marketplace, and search.\nWe use the data we have - for example, about the connections you make, the choices and settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our Products - to personalize your experience.\nConnect you with people and organizations you care about: We help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that matter to you across the Facebook Products you use.\nWe use the data we have to make suggestions for you and others - for example, groups to join, events to attend, Pages to follow or send a message to, shows to watch, and people you may want to become friends with.\nStronger ties make for better communities, and we believe our services are most useful when people are connected to people, groups, and organizations they care about.\nEmpower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you: There are many ways to express yourself on Facebook and to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing status updates, photos, videos, and stories across the Facebook Products you use, sending messages to a friend or several people, creating events or groups, or adding content to your profile.\nWe have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as augmented reality and 360 video to create and share more expressive and engaging content on Facebook.\nHelp you discover content, products, and services that may interest you: We show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you discover content, products, and services that are offered by the many businesses and organizations that use Facebook and other Facebook Products.\nSection 2 below explains this in more detail.\nCombat harmful conduct and protect and support our community: People will only build community on Facebook if they feel safe.\nWe employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical systems to detect misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community.\nIf we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, blocking access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement.\nWe share data with other Facebook Companies when we detect misuse or harmful conduct by someone using one of our Products.\nUse and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone: We use and develop advanced technologies - such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - so that people can use our Products safely regardless of physical ability or geographic location.\nFor example, technology like this helps people who have visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos shared on Facebook or Instagram.\nWe also build sophisticated network and communication technology to help more people connect to the internet in areas with limited access.\nAnd we develop automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.\nResearch ways to make our services better: We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products.\nThis includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.\nOur Data Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.\nProvide consistent and seamless experiences across the Facebook Company Products: Our Products help you find and connect with people, groups, businesses, organizations, and others that are important to you.\nWe design our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless across the different Facebook Company Products that you use.\nFor example, we use data about the people you engage with on Facebook to make it easier for you to connect with them on Instagram or Messenger, and we enable you to communicate with a business you follow on Facebook through Messenger.\nEnable global access to our services: To operate our global service, we need to store and distribute content and data in our data centers and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence.\nThis infrastructure may be operated or controlled by Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or its affiliates.\nReturn to top 2.\nHow our services are funded Instead of charging you to use Facebook and the other products and services we offer, by using the Facebook Products covered by these Terms you agree that we can show you ads that business and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products.\nWe use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.\nProtecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our ad system.\nThis means that we can show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are.\nWe don't sell your personal data.\nWe allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal, and the kind of audience they want to see their ads (for example, people between the age of 18-35 who like cycling).\nWe then show their ad to people who might be interested.We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Facebook.\nFor example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience.\nWe don\u2019t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission.\nLearn more about how Facebook ads work here.\nWe collect and use your personal data in order to provide the services described above to you.\nYou can learn about how we collect and use your data in our Data Policy.\nYou have controls over the types of ads and advertisers you see, and the types of information we use to determine which ads we show you.\nLearn more.\nReturn to top 3.\nYour commitments to Facebook and our community We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission.\nIn exchange, we need you to make the following commitments: 1.\nWho can use Facebook When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable.\nFor this reason, you must: <ul>\n<li>Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</li>\n<li>Provide accurate information about yourself.</li>\n<li>Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes.</li>\n<li>Not share your password, give access to your Facebook account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).</li>\n</ul> We try to make Facebook broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Facebook if: <ul>\n<li>You are under 13 years old.</li>\n<li>You are a convicted sex offender.</li>\n<li>We've previously suspended or terminated your account for breaches of our Terms or Policies.</li>\n<li>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws.</li>\n</ul>2.\nWhat you can share and do on Facebook We want people to use Facebook to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community.\nYou therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so): <ol>\n<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything: <ul>\n<li>That breaches these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies that apply to your use of Facebook.</li>\n<li>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</li>\n<li>That infringes or breaches someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products.</li>\n<li>You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.</li>\n</ol> We can remove or block content that is in breach of these provisions.\nIf we remove content that you have shared for violation of our Community Standards we\u2019ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability.\nharm our community of users.\ncompromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products.\nwhere we are restricted due to technical limitations.\nor where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.\nTo help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe breaches your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.\nWe also can remove or restrict access to your content, services or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts to Facebook.3.\nThe permissions you give us We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: <br>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Permission to use content you create and share:</u> You own the content you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Products you use, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content.\nYou are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\nTo provide our services, though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.\nSpecifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).\nThis license is only for the purpose of making our Products available to you.\nThis means, for example, that if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Facebook Products you use.\nYou can end this license any time by deleting your content or account.\nYou should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users).\nIn addition, content you delete may continue to appear if you have shared it with others and they have not deleted it.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Use of your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content:</u> Your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on Facebook can be used next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you.\nFor example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a Page created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Facebook.\nAds like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on Facebook.\nYou can learn more about your ad settings and preferences.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Permission to update software you use or download:</u> If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.</li>\n</ol>4.\nLimits on using our intellectual property If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on Facebook), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours).\nYou can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.\nYou must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.\nReturn to top 4.\nAdditional provisions 1.\nUpdating our TermsWe work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community.\nAs a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices.\nWe will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable for you in consideration of your interests.We will notify you (for example, by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless the changes are required by law.\nWe will inform you about this 30 day period and its importance in our notification.\nOnce any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Facebook community, you can delete your account at any time.2.\nAccount suspension or termination We want Facebook to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.\nOur right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected.\nGood cause is specifically if a party violates obligations under these Terms, any laws, third party rights, or privacy policies, and the terminating party cannot be expected to continue the contractual relationship under consideration of all circumstances of the individual case and having weighed the interests of both parties up until the agreed time of termination or the expiry of a period of notice.\nA termination for good cause is possible only within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the violation.\nIf the good cause is a breach of an obligation of these Terms, termination is permitted only after an unsuccessful granted cure duty has expired, or after an unsuccessful warning.\nHowever, a time limit for remedy is not necessary if the other side refuses to fulfill their obligations seriously and with finality or if special circumstances justify an immediate termination, having weighed the interests of both parties.\nYou can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.\nIf you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3.3.1, 4.2-4.5.\n3.\nLimits on liability We are liable only as follows: We have unlimited liability in accordance with statutory provisions: arising out of injury damaging to life, limb or health.\nin case of intent.\nof gross negligence.\nand in accordance with the Product Liability Act.\nWithout limiting any of the above, we shall be liable for slight negligence only in the case of violation of an \"essential\" obligation under this agreement.\n\"Essential\" obligations in this sense are obligations necessary for the fulfillment of the agreement, the breach of which would jeopardize the purpose of the agreement in question, and which you can trust to be complied with.\nIn these cases, liability is limited to typical and foreseeable damages.\nin other cases, there is no liability for slight negligence.\n4.\nDisputes We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us.\nIf a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.\nIf you are a consumer and habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union, the laws of that Member State will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Facebook Products (\"claim\"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that Member State that has jurisdiction over the claim.\nIn all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved in a competent court in the Republic of Ireland and that Irish law will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.\n5.\nOther<ol>\n<li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited regarding your use of our Products.\nThey supersede any prior agreements.</li>\n<li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms.\nIf you use any of these Products, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to supplemental terms that will become part of our agreement with you.\nFor instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms.\nIf you post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines.\nTo the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.</li>\n<li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.\nAny amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.</li>\n<li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.</li>\n<li>You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized.\nOnly your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialized.</li>\n<li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.\nAll of our contractual rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</li>\n<li>You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).We will inform you in advance if we have to do this and explain why.</li>\n<li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services.\nBut you should know that we may use them without any restriction, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</li>\n</ol>Return to top 5.\nOther terms and policies that may apply to you <ul>\n<li>Community Standards: These guidelines outline our standards regarding the content you post to Facebook and your activity on Facebook and other Facebook Products.</li>\n<li>Commercial Terms: These terms apply if

cookies if you have a Facebook account, use the Facebook Products, including our website and apps, or visit other websites and apps that use the Facebook Products (including the Like button or other Facebook Technologies).\nCookies enable Facebook to offer the Facebook Products to you and to understand the information we receive about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in.\n<br>\n<br> This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have.\nExcept as otherwise stated in this policy, the Data Policy will

Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Facebook Products, such as by personalising content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience.\nThe cookies that we use include session cookies, which are deleted when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which stay on your browser until they expire or you delete them.\nWhile the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Facebook Products, we use them for the following purposes: Authentication We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you\u2019re logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Facebook Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Facebook Pages.\nCookies also help us remember your browser so you do not have to keep logging in to Facebook and so you can more easily log in to Facebook via third-party apps and websites.\nFor example, we use the \u2018c_user\u2019 and \u2018xs\u2019 cookies for this purpose, with a lifespan of 365 days.\n</blockquote>Security, site and product integrity We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Facebook Products safe and secure.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Facebook account without authorisation, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords.\nWe also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked.\nThis includes, for example, our \u2018sb\u2019 and \u2018dbln\u2019 cookies, which enable us to identify your browser securely.</blockquote> We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Facebook Products.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Facebook accounts.\nWe also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm.\nOur \u2018csrf\u2019 cookie, for example, helps us prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.\nCookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Facebook accounts.</blockquote>Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurement We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organisations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have previously visited a business\u2019s website, purchased its products or used its apps and to recommend products and services based on that activity.\nCookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you see an ad so you don\u2019t see the same ad over and over again.\nFor example, the \u2018fr\u2019 cookie is used to deliver, measure and improve the relevancy of ads, with a lifespan of 90 days.\n</blockquote> We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Facebook Products.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> We use cookies to count the number of times that an ad is shown and to calculate the cost of those ads.\nWe also use cookies to measure how often people do things such as make a purchase following an ad impression.\nThe \u2018_fbp\u2019 cookie identifies browsers for the purposes of providing advertising and site analytics services and has a lifespan of 90 days.\n.</blockquote> Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> We can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over and over again across the different devices that you use.</blockquote> Cookies also allow us to provide insights about the people who use the Facebook Products, as well as the people who interact with the ads, websites and apps of our advertisers and the businesses that use the Facebook Products.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> We use cookies to help businesses understand the kinds of people who like their Facebook Page or use their apps so they can provide more relevant content and develop features that are likely to be interesting to their customers.</blockquote> We also use cookies, like our \u2018oo\u2019 cookie, which has a lifespan of five years, to help you opt out of seeing ads from Facebook based on your activity on third-party websites.\nLearn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off the Facebook Products and the controls that are available to you.\nSite features and services We use cookies to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Facebook Products.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us store preferences, know when you\u2019ve seen or interacted with Facebook Products\u2019 content and provide you with customised content and experiences.\nFor instance, cookies allow us to make suggestions to you and others, and to customise content on third-party sites that integrate our social plugins.\nIf you are a page administrator, cookies allow you to switch between posting from your personal Facebook account and the Page.\nWe use cookies like the session-based \u2018presence\u2019 cookie to support your use of Messenger chat windows.</blockquote> We also use cookies to help provide you with content relevant to your locale.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> We store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so that you will see the site in your preferred language.</blockquote>Performance We use cookies to provide you with the best experience possible.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Facebook Products load for different people.\nCookies also help us record the ratio and dimensions of your screen and windows and know whether you\u2019ve enabled high-contrast mode, so that we can render our sites and apps correctly.\nFor example, we set the \u2018dpr\u2019 and \u2018wd\u2019 cookies, each with a lifespan of 7 days, to deliver an optimal experience for your device\u2019s screen.\n</blockquote>Analytics and research We use cookies to better understand how people use the Facebook Products so that we can improve them.\n<blockquote>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies can help us understand how people use the Facebook service, analyse which parts of the Facebook Products people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.</blockquote>Google Analytics We also set cookies from the Facebook.com domain that work with the Google Analytics service to help us understand how businesses use Facebook's developer sites.\nThese cookies have names such as __utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmz, __qca and _ga.\nThird-party websites and apps Our business partners may also choose to share information with Facebook from cookies set in their own websites' domains, whether or not you have a Facebook account or are logged in.\nSpecifically, cookies named _fbc or _fbp may be set on the domain of the Facebook business partner whose site you're visiting.\nUnlike cookies that are set on Facebook's own domains, these cookies aren\u2019t accessible by Facebook when you're on a site other than the one on which they were set, including when you are on one of our domains.\nThey serve the same purposes as cookies set in Facebook's own domain, which are to personalise content (including ads), measure ads, produce analytics and provide a safer experience, as set out in this Cookies
