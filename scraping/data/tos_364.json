the Badoo Terms and Conditions available here apply to you.</p>The Summary <p>Hello.\nYou should read these terms and conditions in full because they apply every time you visit Badoo and use any of its features.\nHowever, just in case you ever need a reminder of the main points, here\u2019s a quick summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you are under the age of 18 then unfortunately you can\u2019t use Badoo yet because it\u2019s a meeting place for adults only.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re not responsible for anything that you post or say while you are on Badoo and we don\u2019t monitor the content of the site, but if we do see or someone alerts us that you have posted something that we think is inappropriate then we are allowed at our discretion to remove it.</li>\n<li>If you post any content that actually belongs to someone else and they get annoyed (or even call in their lawyers), we are not in the firing line.\nYou have to take responsibility for what you post.</li>\n<li>Please refer to our Community Guidelines and Safety Tips for additional Dos and Don\u2019ts, and information on staying safe.</li>\n<li>If you are concerned about how your data is being used by Badoo then please refer to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use Badoo.\nBy using Badoo, you agree that we can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nOur website and apps also use cookies or similar technologies which we tell you more about here.\nYou may set your browser and your mobile settings to block cookies and local storage devices, but if you do so, you may not be able to access the features that Badoo offers.</li>\n</ol>The full legal bit <p>Badoo is a social media website and app designed as a forum for meeting new people, a place to have discussions and to share photos, news and information.\nIt is intended to be a fun place to visit and it is important to us (and for you) that it remains a safe and friendly environment so you agree that you will only use Badoo in a manner consistent with its purpose and which is in accordance with these terms and conditions, as well as the Badoo Community Guidelines and Safety Tips (the \u201c<b>Terms</b>\u201d).\nWhen we mention Badoo, we mean www.badoo.com, together with affiliated websites and applications.</p>\n<p>The Terms constitute a binding legal agreement between you as user (\u201c<b>you</b>\u201d) and the Badoo Group (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d).\nThe Badoo Group includes, but is not limited to, Badoo Trading Limited (an English company whose registered office is at The Broadgate Tower, Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London EC2A 2RS), Social Online Payments Limited (a company incorporated in Ireland under company number 496494) and Social Online Payments, Inc.\n(a company incorporated in Delaware under company number 5214252).</p>\n<p>The Terms apply whenever you visit Badoo, whether or not you have chosen to register with us, so please read them carefully.\nBy accessing, using, registering for or receiving services offered on Badoo you are accepting and agreeing to be bound by the Terms.</p>\n<p>IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP OR SITE.</p>1.\nUse of the app and site and rules relating to Content Who can use Badoo? <p>Badoo is a meeting place for adults.\nYou may only use Badoo, including any of its features, or become a registered member if you are 18 years old or older (or the age of majority in the country in which you reside if that happens to be greater than 18).</p>\n<p>You warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and be bound by the Terms and that by using Badoo you will not be violating any law or regulation of the country in which you are resident.\nYou are solely responsible for your compliance with all applicable local laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>You further warrant that you have not been convicted of, nor are subject to any court order relating to assault, violence, sexual misconduct or harassment.</p>What kind of content can I post or upload on Badoo? <p>You are able to post or upload all kinds of things on Badoo, including photographs, emails, messages and other content (\u201c<b>Content</b>\u201d).</p>\n<p>There are some rules about what is acceptable though, so when you are using Badoo you may <u>not</u> post, send or upload any Content which:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>contains expletives or language which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;</li>\n<li>is obscene, pornographic or otherwise may offend human dignity;</li>\n<li>is abusive, insulting or threatening, or which promotes, depicts or encourages violence, self-harm, suicide, racism, sexism, hatred or bigotry;</li>\n<li>encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;</li>\n<li>is defamatory;</li>\n<li>relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);</li>\n<li>involves the transmission of \u201cjunk\u201d mail or \u201cspam\u201d;</li>\n<li>impersonates a person, company or brand with the intent to deceive or confuse others;</li>\n<li>contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal data whether from Badoo or otherwise;</li>\n<li>itself, or the posting of which, infringes any third party\u2019s rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);</li>\n<li>shows another person where such Content was created or distributed without that person\u2019s knowledge, and without that person having been afforded an opportunity to refuse such creation or distribution.\nor</li>\n<li>contains images of children, even if you are also in the photo, or endangers minors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please use your common sense when picking the Content that you choose to post on, upload or send via Badoo because you are solely responsible for, and bear all liability in relation to, such Content.</p>\n<p>We use a combination of automated systems and a team of moderators to monitor and review accounts and messages for content that indicates breaches of these Terms.\nIf you repeatedly infringe our rules, you may be prevented from using Badoo and we may restrict your access to Badoo, disable your account or block you from further use of Badoo.\nWe may remove any Content you submit to Badoo if we believe it violates the Terms or we are required to do so by applicable law.</p>Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address? <p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page (\u201c<b>Profile</b>\u201d) whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work).\nIf you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk.\nWe encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances.\nYou are required to follow our Guidelines and Safety Tips when doing so.</p>What about other people\u2019s personal data, can I use it? <p>You may only use other Badoo users\u2019 personal data to the extent that your use of it matches Badoo\u2019s purpose of allowing people to meet one another.\nYou may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats.\nBadoo reserves the right to terminate your account, or prevent access to its features if you misuse other users' information.</p>Who can see the Content that I put on Badoo? <p>When you upload Content to Badoo it can be accessed and viewed by the general public.\nIf you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access.\nIf you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Badoo.\nWe reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to Badoo without any incurring liability to you.\nWe have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Badoo, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Badoo, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Badoo.</p>Anything else I need to know? <p>When you use Badoo you agree to the Terms, and in return we grant you a limited, personal, non-exclusive and non-transferable licence to use and to upload Content and to use Badoo solely for your personal use.\nApart from this licence, you have no other rights in the use of the site, app, or its Content or features, and you may not modify, edit, copy, reproduce, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, alter, enhance or in any way exploit any of the site or Content in any manner.\nIf you breach any of the Terms, the above licence will terminate automatically and you must immediately destroy any downloaded or printed Content.</p>2.\nOwnership of Content Once I have uploaded Content on Badoo, do I still own it? <p>Yes (provided you are the rightful owner in the first place - please see our other rules regarding posting Content that doesn\u2019t belong to you).</p>\n<p>Please note though that by posting, uploading or sending Content on Badoo you represent and warrant to us that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>you are either

right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any Content posted or uploaded by you to our app or site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights or of

<p>Unfortunately we can\u2019t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which are outside our control, so Badoo is provided on an \u201cas is\u201d \u201cas available\u201d basis.\nNo warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or performance of Badoo and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Badoo without notice and without incurring any liability to you.</p>What about mobile access? <p>You are responsible for making all the necessary arrangements to ensure you can access Badoo (including, but not limited to Internet provider and mobile internet provider fees and, any other charges associated with such access).\nWe shall not be held responsible for any reduced functionality you may encounter as result of or in connection with accessing Badoo through mobile services or any similar service currently known or developed in the future.</p>\n<p>By accessing Badoo or agreeing to receive messages or notifications from Badoo through your mobile phone and/or any other connected media device, you accept that you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider.\nWe shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.</p>I\u2019m not registered and I can\u2019t seem to access some Content or features on the app or site.\nWhy is that? <p>Non-registered users are able to access only that portion of Badoo that is publicly available.\nThey will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload any Content.\nThe extent of registered users\u2019 access to Badoo will depend on certain criteria relating to their Profile being met.\nWe may change or update the criteria from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.</p>5.\nTermination of use by you They say that you can have too much of a good thing...\nwhat do I do if I want to \u201cunregister\u201d myself from Badoo? <p>If you have registered on Badoo, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the \u2018Settings\u2019 control on Badoo when you are logged in and choosing the \u2018delete profile\u2019 link.\nWe save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account.\nMany users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Badoo.\nYou will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in its entirety within 28 days of de-activating it.\nOnce your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded on to Badoo.\nFor further details, please refer to our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Content that you have uploaded to Badoo, other than your Profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Badoo following termination of your registration.</p>6.\nAbuse/Complaints Someone is not obeying the Terms, who do I tell?

<p>Badoo may contain links to other sites, resources and purchase opportunities provided by third parties.\nThese links are provided to you for your information only.\nIf you access these links you may be directed to third party sites.\nThese third party sites will have their own terms of use and privacy policies, which may differ from the Terms.\nThe display of links to third party sites does not constitute an endorsement by us of any of the third party content information, sites, or resources provided.</p>\n<p>Please note that we have no control over the contents of any third party sites or resources, and we accept no responsibility for them, including (but not limited to) the third party site\u2019s compliance with any applicable laws or regulations.</p>9.\nDisclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability I forgot the rules about conduct on here and now someone is threatening to sue me.\nWill your lawyers sort it out?

functions and provide services to us (\u201cService Providers\u201d).\nThe suppliers with which Badoo shares User personal data vary depending on a variety of factors, such as which of our Apps and Sites a User engages with.\nFor example, to provide our services to Badoo App Users, we typically use the following suppliers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Billing services - to allow customers to purchase paid features of our App (for example, Google Play)</li>\n<li>Authentication services - to allow customers to authenticate their account (for example, Twilio)</li>\n<li>Social media providers - to allow customers to create/connect their Badoo account with their account(s) on such platforms (for example Facebook or Instagram)</li>\n<li>Product improvement and market research - we use third party platforms (such as Typeform) and agencies (such as Kantar) to carry out customer surveys and market research to improve our products and services</li>\n<li>Growth marketing services - to allow us to market and advertise Badoo to potential customers (for example AppsFlyer and Facebook)</li>\n<li>IT services - some of the third-party software providers used in the operation of our business may process customers\u2019 personal data (for example, if a customer contacts us via social media with a support inquiry, their inquiry is processed by our community management software provider Khoros)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We carry out due diligence on all Service Providers we engage to ensure they have adequate data protection and information security measures in place and only provide them with the personal data necessary to the service they are providing.\nOur suppliers are also subject to extensive obligations under our contractual arrangements, including strict data retention limits.</p>Sharing your personal data with Marketing Service Providers and Advertising Partners <p>We may partner with advertising publishers to place third party adverts on our App and Sites (\u2018Advertising Partners\u2019).\nWe also partner with providers of marketing services (such as Facebook for example) (\u2018Marketing Services Providers\u2019) to help us market and advertise our App and services on third party websites and applications and measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to exclude you from advertising campaigns aimed at finding new users, if you already have a Badoo account;</li>\n<li>to show Badoo adverts to users who have visited the Badoo App/Sites but haven\u2019t yet created a Badoo account;</li>\n<li>to show Badoo adverts to existing Badoo Users to encourage them to use the service (for example, when we release new features for the App, we may advertise these features to existing Users).\nor</li>\n<li>to create an audience for our advertisements of other potential users who have similar characteristics to you based on the information the Marketing Service Providers hold about you (also known as a Lookalike Audience).\nor</li>\n<li>to include you in a \u2018custom audience\u2019 that will receive Badoo advertising content (a custom audience is essentially a list of people who we think are most likely to be interested in a particular advertisement).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share a limited amount of your personal data with companies that help us with marketing and advertising namely:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the advertising identifier associated with your device (this is a random number assigned by your mobile device manufacturer (for example Apple or Google) to your device to help advertisers (including the manufacturer), know when an ad has been viewed or clicked on in the App or sites, and when an ad causes a \u201cconversion\u201d (for example downloading the app advertised to you))</li>\n<li>your estimated location (based on your IP address)</li>\n<li>age and gender</li>\n<li>data about your visit to our Sites or App and action taken on those (for example if you download our App or created an Account with our App)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information about how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, including how you can set and manage your preferences with regards to such technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>Some platforms require user consent before Badoo is permitted to use data gained through the platform for advertising purposes and where it is the case, Badoo will only use this data where the necessary consent has been obtained.\nThrough your device\u2019s security settings, you also have the option to prevent or limit device identifiers being shared with third party advertisers and what use is made of the device identifiers.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit this page.</p>\n<p>In some cases, these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients.</p>Sharing with Facebook <p>Where we share data with Facebook as our Marketing Service Provider (including via the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d function), we are Joint Data Controllers with Facebook Ireland for this processing.\nThis arrangement means that Badoo has to provide you this notice, but you should contact Facebook if you wish to exercise your data protection rights.\nFurther information, including how Facebook enables you to exercise your data protection rights, and subsequently processes your information as an independent data controller can be found in Facebook Ireland\u2019s Data Policy.\nIf you want more information relating to the nature of the arrangement we have in place with Facebook, please email DPO@corp.badoo.com.</p>\n<p>This data referred to above can include actions that you take on our website such as your interactions with our website or other information collected from cookies or similar technologies including the Facebook pixel.\nThis allows us to measure the effectiveness of our advertising, improve our marketing practices, and helps us deliver more relevant advertising to you and people like you (including on social media such as Facebook).</p>4.\nWHAT OTHERS MAY SEE ABOUT YOU<p>We think our Users are awesome, and we want you to share how awesome you are with the world, so we have built certain features to enable this.\nOur App is designed to make it easier for you to connect with other Users and to interact with them.</p>\n<p>When using the Badoo App, you should assume that <b>anything</b> you post or submit on the App may be publicly-viewable and accessible, both by Users of the App and non-users of the App.\nWe want our Users to be careful about posting information that may eventually be made public.</p>\n<p>Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details.\nWhile you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences, there is no requirement to do so.\nPlease remember that photographs that you post on Badoo may reveal information about yourself as well.\n<b>Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing of this information and making it public to other Users.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Your Badoo profile and other information you make available via the App, including certain information added to your profile through third party accounts (such as Facebook or Instagram \u2013 see section 7 of this Privacy Policy for more information about this) may be viewed and shared by Users with individuals who may or may not be Users of the App.\nFor example, a User may recommend you as a match to his or her Facebook friend(s) by taking a screenshot of your profile picture and sharing it, regardless of whether such friend(s) is also a User of the App.</p>\n<p>Please also note that in certain countries (currently, South Korea only) Users are provided with functionality enabling them to download a copy of their conversation history (as this is required by local laws) and that Badoo has no control over how Users may then publish or use that information.</p>\n<p>If you log in to or access the App through your Facebook account or another third-party account on a device which you share with others, remember to log out of the App and the relevant third-party account when you leave the device in order to prevent other users from accessing your Badoo account.</p>5.\nOUR POLICY TOWARDS AGE.<p>Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years old to use the App - sorry kids, we know Badoo is cool, but you\u2019ll have to come back when you\u2019re old enough!</p>\n<p>Badoo does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under the age of majority.\nIf we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and provided us with personal data, we will take steps to terminate that person\u2019s registration and delete their Profile information from Badoo.\nIf we do delete a Profile because you violated our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get around our rules by creating a new Profile.</p>6.\nSECURITY.<p>Badoo has implemented appropriate security measures to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure and alteration of the information under our control, including your personal data.\nWe use reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information.\nOur technical experts at Badoo work hard to ensure your secure use of our site.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no website or Internet transmission is ever completely 100% secure and even we cannot guarantee that unauthorised access, hacking, data loss or other breaches will never occur, but here are some handy tips to help keep your data secure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Please make sure you log out of your Account after use as you never know who may stumble onto your Account!</li>\n<li>Please don\u2019t share the password you use to access your Badoo Account with anyone else!</li>\n<li>Change your password periodically.</li>\n</ol>7.\nLINKING OTHER ACCOUNTS TO BADOO.Using your social media details to sign in to Badoo <p>When you sign in to our App using your Facebook account, you give permission to Facebook to share with us your name and profile picture.\nUnless you opt-out, you also give permission to Facebook to share with us your email address (if there is one associated with your Facebook account), date of birth, profile photos, gender, Page likes and current town/city.</p>\n<p>If you register or sign in with your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your Apple login, a name (that can be edited by you) and an email (you can choose to hide your email and Apple will create a random email address so your personal email can stay private).\nThis email address will be linked to your Badoo account and will be used to retrieve your Badoo account.</p>\n<p>We will then use this personal data to form your Badoo account.\nIf you remove the Badoo app from your Facebook settings, or from your Apple ID, we will no longer have access to this data.\nHowever, we will still have the personal data that we received when you first set up your Badoo account using your Facebook or Apple ID (you must delete your Badoo account entirely for us to no longer have access to this data).</p>Linking social media accounts to your Badoo account <p>You may link your Badoo account with your Instagram or Facebook accounts.\nThis allows you to share some information from those accounts directly to your Badoo account (for example, Instagram photos).</p>\n<p>We only receive the limited information that Instagram/Facebook permits to be transferred (as detailed by Instagram/Facebook and agreed by you when you first connect your account from such platforms with your Badoo account).</p>\n<p>If you no longer want to link your Badoo account to your Instagram or Facebook account, please visit the settings in your Instagram or Facebook account and follow the instructions to remove the Badoo app access permissions.\nPlease note that any information already added to your Badoo account from those platforms will not be deleted unless you delete it within your Badoo account as well.</p>8.\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<p>For Users who are California residents, you have the following rights (in addition to those listed at section 9 below) under the California Consumer Privacy Act, and you have the right to be free from unlawful discrimination for exercising your rights under the

information to third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes.\nIf you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you can write to

party to allow them to market their products or services to you.\nWhere this is a condition for participation in a promotion, we will always let you know before you enter the promotion.\nPlease follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.</p>\n<p>In addition, Under California law, operators of online services are required to disclose how they respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party online services, to the extent the operator engages in that collection.\nAt this time, we do not track our Users\u2019 personal information over time and across third-party online services.\nThis law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users\u2019 online activities over time and across different online services when the users use the operator\u2019s service.\nWe do not knowingly permit third parties to collect personal information about an individual User\u2019s online activities over time and across different online services when using the App.</p>9.\nYOUR RIGHTS.<p>Privacy laws applicable in your country may give you the following rights:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right to be informed:

decision-making process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you want to exercise any of your rights listed above please visit our Feedback Page or email our Data Protection Officer at DPO@corp.badoo.com.\nYou can also contact us by post at the following address: The Broadgate Tower Third Floor, 20 Primrose Street, London, United Kingdom, EC2A 2RS.\nFor your protection and the protection of all of our Users, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\n<p>If you have a concern about how we have processed your request or your personal data, you should contact us in the first instance via the contact details listed above.</p>\n<p>If you feel we have not resolved your concern, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk).\nIf you live in a country or territory located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA), you may also get in touch with your local Data Protection Regulator.</p>EU Representative <p>Pursuant to Article 27 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Badoo has appointed Borlux Ltd as its GDPR representative in the EU.\nIf you usually reside in an EU Member State you can contact Borlux Ltd regarding matters pertaining to the GDPR by:</p>\n<p>Using the online request form at - https://services.nathantrust.com/privacycontact</p>\n<p>Postal address: 1st Floor, 6 Lapps Quay, Cork, Ireland</p>10.\nDATA LOCATIONS.<p>We want you to be able to access Badoo wherever you happen to be in the world.\nTo enable us to provide that service, we operate a global network of servers including in the US, UK, EU, and (for Users located in Russia) Russia.\nThe hardware is located in third-party data centres but is owned by the Badoo Group.\nData collected by Advertising Partners and other Service Providers may also be held outside the UK and the European Economic Area.\nWe ensure that the data is adequately protected by ensuring that valid, legal mechanisms are in place such as: EU approved model clauses (which can be found here), and implementing robust contractual standards.\nIf you want more information relating to the nature of the safeguards we have in place, please email DPO@corp.badoo.com.</p>11.\nDATA RETENTION AND DELETION.<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for the legal basis relied upon (as set out in Section 2 above) and as permitted by applicable law.</p>\n<p>You may permanently delete your Account at any time (although we really hope you don\u2019t!)</p>\n<p>When your Account is deactivated, we take reasonable efforts to make sure it is no longer viewable on the App.\nFor up to 28 days it is still possible to restore your Account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.\nAfter 28 days, we begin the process of deleting your personal information from our systems, unless:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, if you make purchases within the App, some personal data may need to be kept for accounting purposes);</li>\n<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law;</li>\n<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved.\nor</li>\n<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing Users\u2019 safety and security.\nFor example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behaviour or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Where Badoo uses machine learning, for example, to help us detect and prevent fraudulent card transactions, and to detect and prevent spam communications on the App (as explained above), we may need to keep personal information for a longer period than the retention periods explained above, to enable the machine learning to work properly.\nWhere this is the case, we always seek to minimise the amount of personal information that is used and we ensure that it is ring-fenced and kept securely from other user personal information.\nWe regularly review the period for which personal information is required for machine learning purposes and delete any identifiable information when it is no longer required.</p>\n<p>To prevent abuse and/or misuse of Badoo by a User following termination or deletion of a profile/Account we shall retain such information as we deem in our sole discretion may be necessary to ensure that a User does not open a new Account and profile in breach of our Terms and Conditions of Use and to ensure compliance with all laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Warning:</b> Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your Account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by others.\nWe cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this.\nIf you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading, we hope we didn\u2019t drone on for too long!</p>12.\nCHANGES TO THIS POLICY.<p>As Badoo evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nThe most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://badoo.com/privacy/.\nIf we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you, for example, via an email to the email associated with your Account or by posting a notice within Badoo.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Effective date.</b> This Privacy Policy was last updated on 18 June 2021.</p> Download our free apps: <i>\n</i>
