court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys\u2019 fees).&nbsp.\nHowever, WITH ARBITRATION: (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.&nbsp.\nAll parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.&nbsp.\nIf an

the administrative and arbitrator\u2019s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\nbut, if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Sulake to pay a greater portion

permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide

court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1.5 No Class Action Matters</strong>.&nbsp.\nDisputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.&nbsp.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 10.1.3 holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 10.1.2 to arbitrate will not apply, and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 10.3.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1.6 Limited Time to File

collect statistics on the use of the Service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to refuse or opt out of cookies</strong>: You have the right to choose whether to accept or refuse cookies and similar technologies.\nIf you choose to use the Service without blocking or disabling cookies, you will indicate your consent to our use of these cookies and other technologies.\nYou also indicate your consent to our use (in accordance with this privacy policy) of any personal information that we collect using these technologies.</p>\n<strong>How and why are we using your data?</strong>\nGrounds for data processing\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following personal data is processed based on <em>performance of a contract</em>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact information for delivering the Services and for customer service.</li>\n<li>Payment information for online and in-app purchases.</li>\n<li>Online identifiers and customer profile information used for the smooth running of our Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following personal data is processed based on our <em>legitimate interest</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact and payment information for fraud prevention.</li>\n<li>Customer profile information for content moderation and targeted in-game offers.</li>\n<li>Device information for customer service, advertising and analytics.</li>\n<li>Online identifiers for analytics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may process parts of your personal data based on <em>the</em>\n<em>consent</em> that you have provided.\nYou can withdraw this consent at any time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, we process personal data in order to comply with <em>a legal obligation</em>, such as the prevention of crime or fraud, or to maintain records related to purchases.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Profiling</strong>\n<p>We want to customise and develop our Services so they are more relevant to you.\nWe use anonymised in-game behavioural data to deliver content that is more relevant to you and at better prices.\nThis data can also be used to guide and support content and feature production, allowing us to provide more interesting and relevant content in the future.\nPersonal data is processed in a secure and confidential manner.\n</p>\n<strong>The retention period for personal data</strong>\n<p>We only retain your personal data for as long as it takes to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, and for a reasonable time thereafter.\nWe do this as it is required by law in order for us to be able to comply with our <em>legal obligations</em>, to resolve any potential disputes and to enforce our agreements.\nThe retention period for your personal data varies depending on the service and the nature of the data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When the retention period for the data has ended, we dispose of the personal data either by removing them or making them anonymous (i.e.\nanonymisation of the data in question).\nWe process some of your personal data - such as contact information - for the entire duration of our relationship with you as the customer.\nConversely, the retention period of data collected in connection to actually producing and running the Services (for example, server logs) may be relatively short.</p>\n<strong>Marketing</strong>\n<p>We may use personal information we collect to target you with marketing communications about our Services based on your interests.\nFor example, we may send push notifications, email messages, serve ads inside our Services or place ads on third party websites and apps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may send you push notifications via our mobile app if you have given us permission to send &nbsp;them on our Service.\nYou may at any time change the settings of your push notifications.\nWe may send you marketing emails, but only if you opt-in to receive them.\nYou may opt-out of receiving email marketing communications at any time by following the instructions contained in our promotional emails.\nIf you opt-out, we may still send you non-promotional emails such as emails relating to your account.\n</p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>\n<p>Our Services may include ads for third-party products and services.\nTo show you relevant and interesting third-party ads, we and our advertising partners will use information about you.\nAn example of this sort of information could be when you bought a product from a certain website or entered a specific term into a search engine.\nYou can opt-out of interest-based ads, however this does not mean that you will no longer receive ads, only that the ads you receive will be less relevant to your interests.</p>\n<strong>Withdrawing your consent</strong>\n<p>If we process your data based exclusively on the consent you have given, you have the opportunity to withdraw it if you change your mind.\nThis can be done easily within your user preferences in the Service.\nPlease note, however, that this does not affect data processing that is carried out before the withdrawal of consent.</p>\n<strong>Disclosing personal data</strong>\n<p>When we provide services, we may also disclose your <em>personal data</em> to our subcontractors or partner operators who may need to use your data.\nThis includes hosting providers such as Amazon Web Services and payment processors such as Adyen.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>On our websites, we use tools such as cookies and web beacons.\nThese are also used by our cooperation partners for analysis and marketing purposes.\nIn connection with this, we may disclose <em>personal data</em> to the service provider, such as your IP address and cookie information.\nIn these cases, we do not disclose personal data that directly identifies you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some parts of our Services (for example, payment processing) are implemented via cooperation partners like Adyen.\nIn a situation like this, we may disclose some of your personal data to the service provider concerned.\nIn some cases, using the Service requires that you approve the privacy policy or terms of the service provider beforehand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Third parties that act as <em>data controllers</em> process your data in accordance with their own privacy policies.\nFor example, payment processors may process your personal data as part of their own fraud prevention measures.\nBefore disclosing personal data to any third parties, we ensure that the disclosure is in full compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>At the bottom of this page, you are able to download a document named \u00a8Controller privacy policies\u00a8.\nIn this document, we have listed the third parties who process personal data through our Service and then use this data in accordance with their own policies.</p>\n<strong>Assisting authorities</strong>\n<p>Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties if required under any applicable law or regulation or order by competent authorities or in order to enforce the Terms of Service and to investigate possible infringing use of the Services, as well as to guarantee the safety of the Services.\n</p>\n<strong>Subcontractors and processing data outside EU/EEA</strong>\n<p>We use subcontractors such as Amazon Web Services to process and store your <em>personal data</em> outside the European Economic Area (EEA).\nWhen your <em>personal data</em> is processed outside the EEA, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place.\nThese safeguards include using Privacy Shield certified subcontractors and contractual means, such as EU Model Clauses and Data Protection Agreements.</p>\n<strong>Data security</strong>\n<p>We ensure data security when processing your personal data.\nWe always use appropriate protective measures, such as access control based on passwords and other protective methods as well as technical encryption of the data.\nOur operating environment has been secured with firewalls and appropriate anti-virus software.\n<br>\n<br>We primarily process your data in a form where an outsider cannot identify you as a person.\nWe do not ask for or store your real name or identity and our systems use a numeric identifier to identify you both internally and across systems as opposed to something like your email address.\nWith these measures, we protect the confidentiality of your communication and prevent irrelevant connections to your identity.<br>\n<br>Everyone is responsible for looking after data security.\nIn order to ensure the protection of your data, we ask you to pay attention to the data security of your own devices.</p>\n<strong>The coverage of our privacy policy, our contact
