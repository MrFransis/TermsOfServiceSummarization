Query: <i>\n</i> The Policies Purpose\n<p>The freenode project exists to help all communities.\nIts focus is peer-directed projects\nand open innovation communities.\nPeer-directed projects combine open, informal participation\nwith broad licensing and wide dissemination of output.</p>\n<p>freenode provides facilities to peer-directed project communities and the combined efforts\nof open innovations, including those of free and open source software (FOSS).\nFreenode\nutilizes IRC to service its users \u2014 but the network was created to serve groups that\nexist outside of IRC.\nfreenode is designed to encourage community members to improve their\nskills in the areas of cooperative effort, interpersonal communication and project\ncoordination, and to create a real-time bridge to the outside world for our target communities.</p>\nNickname ownership\n<p>Nicknames are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, to the first person\nwho registers the name with NickServ.\nHowever, we expect users to act in good\nfaith and reserve the right to remove a nickname registration where we believe\nthat this has not been the case.\nNickname and account registrations expire ten weeks after they are last used.\nFor nicknames, \u2018used\u2019 means that you were using the nickname while logged in to\nthe account which owns it.\nFor accounts, \u2018used\u2019 means that you logged in to the\naccount, regardless of the nickname you used to do so.\nNicknames which are the\nprimary account name expire only when the entire account is expired.</p>\n<p>In some cases, such as for very old accounts, we may, at our discretion, extend\nthe expiry time of a nickname or account.\nWe will not normally do this beyond 15\nweeks past the last use.</p>\n<p>Some nicknames and accounts, including but not limited to some of those owned by\ncurrent or former network staff, do not expire at all.\nThese accounts can be\nidentified by the \u2018Hold\u2019 flag in their NickServ info output.</p>\n<p>Nicknames and accounts which are expired will not automatically be dropped.\nPlease contact network staff if you would like to take over an expired nickname.</p>\nChannel ownership\n<p>Channels on freenode fall into one of two categories.\nPrimary channels, which\nbegin with a single # character, are reserved for on-topic projects.\nPrimary\nchannels are required to stay open.\nIf a primary channel closes access to its\nusers or is in violation of freenode policies, then it will be closed and forwarded\nto a topical channel.\nIf you\u2019d like to take over one of these primary channels, then\nyou\u2019ll need to be associated in some way with the project in question.\nTopical,\nor \u2018about\u2019 channels, begin with two # characters, and these are allocated on a\nfirst-come, first-served basis to the first person who registers it with ChanServ.\nAs with nicknames, however, we reserve the right to remove or alter registrations\nwhere we believe they have not been made in good faith.</p>\n<p>Primary channels do not expire with inactivity, though they can be claimed at\nany time by a representative of an on-topic project with the appropriate name.\nTopical channels expire after 60 days in which no user on the access list for\nthe channel has joined it.\nFurther information, policies and guidelines relating\nto channel ownership can be found under group registration.</p>\nOn-topic Use\n<p>freenode\u2019s primary goal is to encourage and foster the development and use of\nfree and open source software projects and other peer-directed communities\nproducing broadly licensed creative output.\nAny project falling under this broad\ndescription is likely to be considered on-topic for the purposes of primary\nchannel naming and other project services which we may provide, but individual\ndecisions may be made at the discretion of staff.\n</p>\n<p>We strongly urge you to adhere to the channel guidelines and catalyst guidelines.</p>\nOff-topic Use\n<p>We expect all users of the network, whether affiliated with a project or not, to\nact in good faith and in accordance with both their local laws and those\napplicable where freenode operates.\nUse of freenode and its facilities is a\nprivilege, not a right, and may be withdrawn where we believe that this has not\nbeen the case.</p>\n<p>Unlawful activities and related support activities are considered off-topic, as are\ninappropriate advertising, heavy media file trading, proprietary game software modding,\nwarez, porn and various forms of antisocial behaviour, including (but not limited to) political, racial, ethnic, religious or gender-related invective.</p>\n<p>In accordance with UK law freenode has no tolerance for any activity that could be construed\nas: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>incitement to racial hatred</li>\n<li>incitement to religious hatred</li>\n</ul>\n<p>or any other behaviour meant to deliberately put upon a person harassment, alarm or distress.\nWe do NOT endorse or encourage discrimination on the grounds of e.g.\nrace, religion, gender or sexual preference and operate with a zero-tolerance policy for libel and defamation.</p>\n<p>While we believe in the concept of freedom of thought and freedom of expression, freenode does not\noperate on the basis of absolute freedom of speech, and we impose limitations, e.g.\non \"hate speech\".</p>\n<p>We expect all members of the community to be respectful of one another and of the privacy of others, and we reserve the right to terminate anyone's access to our services at our discretion.</p>\n<p>While we encourage registered groups (projects) and channel owners to adopt our channel guidelines and catalyst guidelines, projects are free to set their own policies for their namespaces as long as such policies do not contravene network policy, and many projects choose to extend their code of conduct and similar agreements to their presence on freenode.\nIn the event that a project makes the decision to ban a user from their channel(s), we ask that such bans be respected and note that ban evasion may result in a network ban.</p>\n<p>Please note that the examples above are examples only and do not constitute an exhaustive list.\nIn line with our policies, philosophies and guidelines we will review each case individually and the response and actions may differ from case to case.</p>\nUnlawful Activity\n<p>freenode cannot condone or support behaviour which is clearly unlawful.\nWhile we do not have the resources\nto closely monitor the thousands of channels on the network, volunteers are required by policy to pass on credible\ninformation, provided by you as a user of the freenode project, about any unlawful activities.\nThis is true whether you\nare talking about your own activities or those of someone else.\nPlease be aware that we have this responsibility.</p>\nfreenode and financial transactions\n<p>We appreciate that end users may sometimes wish to reward a project or a project\ncontributor after having had a positive support experience in a project channel\nand it is great when this results in a donation to the project in question or\nperhaps a micropayment to the contributor concerned or the purchase of an item\nfrom the contributor's wish list.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we would urge our users to carry out their own due diligence\nbefore entering into financial transactions of any kind and stress that any\nfinancial transactions entered into on the freenode network must be undertaken\nentirely at the user's risk and freenode accepts no liability for any losses\nincurred as the result of such transactions.\n</p>\nPublic Logging\n<p>If you are considering publishing channel logs, think it through.\nThe freenode network is an interactive environment and users may not weigh their comments with the idea that they will be enshrined in perpetuity.\n</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, we understand that projects might find it useful to publish channel logs so that other users may search and find answers to questions that have previously been addressed on the freenode network.\nEnsure that you notify users (by way of channel topic, channel entry message or similar) that the channel is being publicly logged and consider providing a way for users to make comments without logging.\n</p>\n<p>If you operate a service that scrapes internal channel content or publishes logs, always make sure to obtain permission from the channel owner or freenode staff before you start publishing logs or other data, and ensure that there is an easy way for projects to opt-out later and to request removal of previously published logs or data.\nYou must respect the opt-out requests in a timely manner.\n</p>\n<p>If you are thinking of \"anonymizing\" your logs (removing information that identifies the specific users), be aware that it's difficult to do it well\u2014replies and general context often provide identifying information which is hard to filter.</p>\n<p>If you just want to publish a single conversation, be careful to get permission from each participant.\nProvide as much context as you can.\nAvoid the temptation to publish or distribute logs without permission in order to portray someone in a bad light.\nThe reputation you save will most likely be your own.</p>\nPrivacy Policy and Data Retention\n<p>This section describes how freenode makes use of the information you provide when you use the freenode network, freenode.net, jobs.freenode.net and
