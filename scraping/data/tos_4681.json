must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>be over 18 and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> What subscription packages does Audioboom offer? <p>We describe the subscription package(s) we offer from time to time on the platform.\nEach subscription is sold subject to that description.</p>\n<p>By the way, we might change the subscriptions we offer from time to time, including on what basis they are offered, for example whether we charge for them or make them available for free, or what is included in the account (e.g.\nadvertising, length of clips etc.).</p> Your subscription package says that it is limited to 10,000 or 25,000 plays per month.\nWhat happens if I exceed that? <p>Your account will continue to work as normal, but if your channel consistently exceeds your limit Audioboom will contact you to let you know that we will be moving you to a more suitable plan by a certain date.\nIf you do not want to be part of the new plan you can cancel your subscription at any time - see below for instructions on how to cancel.</p>\n<p>Payment for your new plan will be taken on the date your channel is moved to that plan.\nThe payment will be pro-rated based on how much time remained on your previous plan.</p> How long is each subscription? <p>You subscribe on a monthly basis (<strong>Monthly Subscription Period</strong>) or an annual basis (<strong>Annual Subscription Period</strong>).\nThe subscription automatically renews at the end of each period, unless you cancel.</p> Free trial <p>The purpose of any free trial we may offer at the beginning of a subscription is to allow new users to try out our service.\nWe decide whether you are eligible for that at our sole discretion.\nIf we think you are not eligible, we reserve the right to revoke the free trial and suspend your account.</p>\n<p>If you have multiple subscriptions with us, you will only be offered a free trial for the first subscription you open with us.</p>\n<p>Any free trial offered will begin when you receive access to your account (see Step 3 in At What point is a contract made for a subscription).</p>\n<p>If you cancel at any time during your free trial period, you will not be charged.\nIf you are enjoying Audioboom, do nothing and your membership will automatically continue and we will charge you at the subscription rate for your chosen plan.</p> At what point is a contract made for a subscription? <p>Here we describe the steps that are taken to lead to a binding contract between you and us for a subscription.</p>\n<p>\n<em>If you buy a subscription on our platform:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Step 1</em>\n</p>\n<p>after selecting the subscription, you\u2019ll be prompted to start setting up your podcast.\nYou will then be asked to click to confirm that you accept these Terms, Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.\nIf you don\u2019t want to agree to our Terms, do not place an order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Step 2</em>\n</p>\n<p>you are then taken to your Dashboard to set up your podcast.\nIf you are offered a free trial, you then click on the \u2018Start My Free Trial\u2019 button and submit your payment details.\nIf you don\u2019t have a free trial as part of your subscription, you just enter your payment details.\nIf you want to cancel your payment details, you can do so on the Billing and Payments section on your Dashboard.\nYou\u2019ll see an on-screen acknowledgement that your order has been placed and you\u2019ll then receive an email confirming that your order has been placed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Step 3</em>\n</p>\n<p>we accept your order and a contract for the subscription is made between us at the time we make the account available to you for use.\nThe only exception to that is if we notify you that we don\u2019t accept your order (see My order has been refused.\nWhat happens now? below).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not keep a record of the contract between you and us, so please print out a copy of any/all your orders and a copy of these Terms, for your own record.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Offline Advertising Agreement:</em>\n</p>\n<p>If you enter into an advertising agreement offline with Audioboom, a contract will be made between us (that may include a subscription plan) when both you and we sign a written agreement.\nThese Terms will also apply to your (and any of your authorised users\u2019) use of the platform.</p> How much does a subscription cost? <p>You will find the total price of your order, when you go to the Billing and Payment page in your Dashboard.\nAll payment is in USD, please check with your debit or credit card provider for the exchange rate on the day payment is taken.\nIt is quoted inclusive of VAT.</p>\n<p>We may change the price of our subscription packages from time to time.\nIf we do that, unless we tell you otherwise, any price change will only apply after the next complete month has expired.\nSo it means you can cancel, before the price change takes effect.</p> How and when do I pay? <p>\n<em>Payment method</em>\n</p>\n<p>We accept various credit/debit cards for payment.\nWhen you place an order you are confirming that you have authority to place the order.\nYou can change your payment method at any time by clicking on \u2018My account\u2019.\nIf we have been unable to obtain payment, we may suspend your access to our platform, until we have obtained payment.\nWhen you update your payment method you are authorising us to continue charging your new payment method.\nThis may result in a change to your usual payment date.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Billing</em>\n</p>\n<p>You will be charged the first monthly subscription fee on the day after your free trial period expires and a further monthly subscription fee at the beginning of each Monthly Subscription Period after that.\nIn some cases, your payment date may change, for example, if payment using your chosen payment method was unsuccessful.\nPlease click on your \u2018Account\u2019 to see your next billing date.</p>\n<p>It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, a subscription package may be incorrectly priced.\nIf that happens, then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>where the correct price is less than the price stated on the platform at the time you placed your order, we\u2019ll charge you the lower amount.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>where the correct price is higher than the price stated on the platform at the time you placed your order, we\u2019ll let you know about the error and we\u2019ll give you the option of continuing to buy at the correct (higher) price or cancelling your order.\nWe won\u2019t process your order until we have your instructions.\nIf we\u2019re unable to contact you using the contact details you\u2019ve given us, we\u2019ll treat the order as cancelled and let you know.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> My order has been refused.\nWhat happens now? <p>If we decline your order for any reason, we\u2019ll let you know by sending you an e-mail.\nIt might be, for example because of an error in pricing or because we can\u2019t process your payment.\nIf we haven\u2019t been able to process your payment, we may invite you to pay by another method.</p> Cancellation Do I have a right to cancel? <p>If you have an advertising agreement with us (i.e.\na separate off line agreement with us), any rights to cancel will be set out in that agreement.</p>\n<p>If you have bought a subscription online, you can cancel at any time.\nSee What\u2019s the effect of my cancellation? to understand what happens when you cancel.</p> How do I cancel my subscription? <p>Click on Billing and Payment in the Dashboard and select \u2018Cancel My Plan\u2019.\nYour subscription will then be cancelled upon renewal.</p> What\u2019s the effect of my cancellation? <p>If you cancel, your subscription will stop at the end of your current Monthly Subscription Period.\nAt that point, your podcast will become private.\nYou you will no longer be able to upload new content, but you will be able to listen or download your existing content.\nYour existing RSS feeds and web embeds will continue to work for a period of 1 month.\nAfter 12 months, Audioboom reserves the right to delete all content and your account.</p>\n<p>Once you cancel your subscription it will no longer automatically renew and no further subscription fees will be charged.\nIf you cancel within the first month of either a Monthly or Annual Subscription Plan you will receive a full refund.\nYou will not be charged if you cancel during a Free Trial period.</p>\n<p>If you are using a Monthly Subscription Plan and cancel during your first paid month you will receive a full refund.\nIf you cancel after your first month you will not receive a refund, but you won\u2019t be charged the monthly subscription fees after the current Monthly Subscription Period has expired.</p>\n<p>If you are using an Annual Subscription Plan and cancel during the first month of an Annual Subscription Period you will receive a full refund of the annual subscription fees paid to us.\nIf you cancel after the first month of an Annual Subscription Period you will not receive a refund, but you won\u2019t be charged the annual subscription fees after the current Annual Subscription Period has expired.</p>\n<p>Except as expressly described in these Terms, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not refund any subscription fees to you that have already been paid to us for the Monthly or Annual Subscription Periods in which you cancel.</p>\n<p>You may have additional rights as a consumer under the laws of your country (e.g.\nif your account is defective).\nThese remain unaffected.</p> Our Liability to you What we don\u2019t restrict our liability for <p>Nothing in these Terms restricts our liability relating to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>any legal rights you have as a
