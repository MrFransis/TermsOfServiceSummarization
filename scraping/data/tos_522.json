is used and shared, and we endeavor to use such information carefully and sensibly.\nThis policy explains how the information you provide is collected and used, as well as your rights in connection to your information under applicable laws.\n</p> What Information Do We Collect? <p>\nWe may collect both Personal Information (PI) and non-Personal Information (non-PI) about you through your experience on our websites, from your use of our services and products and via other voluntary contact with you (collectively \"Services\").\n</p>\n<p>\nThe PI we collect through our Services primarily consists of information you submit to us.\nBecause participation in our Services is voluntary, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information.\nThe following are categories of PI we have collected in the past 12 months: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Identifiers</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples include: a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number, passport number or other similar identifiers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute (Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00a7 1798.80(e))</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples include: a name, signature, Social Security number, physical characteristics or description, address, telephone number, passport number, driver's license or state identification card number, insurance policy number, education, employment, employment history, bank account number, credit card number, debit card number, or any other financial information, medical information or health insurance information.\nSome PI included in this category may overlap with other categories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Internet or other similar network activity</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples include: browsing history, search history, or information on a consumer's interaction with a website, application or advertisement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Geolocation data</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical location only</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Sensory data</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Audio, electronic and visual only</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Professional or employment-related information</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples include: current or past job history or performance evaluations</li>\n</ul>\n<p> In addition to information that you provide to us voluntarily, we receive some additional PI and non-PI whenever you interact with our Services online, including your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, referral URLs and other data automatically supplied by most common web browsers.\n</p>\n<p> We may also collect information from third-party sites, as described below in What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites? </p> How Is Your Information Used? <p> The PI we obtain from users, site participants and visitors helps us enhance and refine our Services.\nNon-PI collected about you through your experience, queries and feedback is used to better understand the entire population that is utilizing our Services and how we might improve the collective experience.\nExcept as noted below, we track and record IP addresses that access our Services for internal reporting, diagnostic analysis and security purposes only.\n</p>\n<p> Your IP address is used to determine, when possible, your approximate geographical location, which affects the computations or outputs provided by our Services for such things as default currency and units of measure based on what country you are in.\nYour browser type may be used to optimize your display, for example, on mobile devices or to work around limitations of a particular browser.\nReferrer URLs may be used to generate usage statistics and analyze usage patterns.\n</p>\n<p> If you provide your email address to us, we may email you in response, as well as notify you of other offers or Services that may be of interest.\nWhen you send email or other communication to us, we may retain that communication to respond to you and improve our Services.\nIf at any time you want to stop receiving communication from us, please click the unsubscribe link in the footer of any email message from us, or contact our Customer Support online or by phone at 1-800-WOLFRAM.\nHowever, please note that we may still contact you with transactional communications associated with any software or service agreements you have with us or in direct response to any communication you send us.\n</p> Disclosures of Your Information <p> We do not sell, rent, trade or lease your information to third parties, and have not done so in the past 12 months.\nAny information we share shall be subject to the parameters associated with your requested Services and preferences.\n</p>\n<p> When we share PI, we require the recipient to protect your PI in compliance with the law, including keeping the PI confidential and not using it for any purpose except the specific purpose of performing our Services and only within the direct business relationship with Wolfram.\nWolfram may share information with affiliates, partners, service providers, authorized resellers and distributors, and relevant third parties in order to fulfill the limited purposes described herein.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the past 12 months, we have disclosed the following categories of PI for a business purpose: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers</li>\n<li>California Customer Records PI categories</li>\n<li>Internet or other similar network activity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe disclose your PI for a business purpose to the following categories of third parties: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our affiliates</li>\n<li>Service providers</li>\n<li>Third parties to whom you or your agents authorize us to disclose your PI in connection with products or Services we provide to you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> Any collected information (PI and non-PI) associated with your use of our Services may also be subject to disclosure to government authorities or other authorized third parties pursuant to a lawful request, subpoena or other process that legally compels disclosure of that information.\n</p>\n<p> We may also preserve, use or disclose your information if necessary to enforce our Terms of Use and related agreements.\nto detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, including suspiciously high-volume use of our Services.\nto respond to support requests.\nor to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, our users or others.\n</p> What Information Do We Collect from Third-Party Sites? <p> When you use our Services to connect to or access data from a third-party site (\"TPS\"), including but not limited to social networking sites, we may collect PI about you from any TPS profile for which you give our Services access credentials.\n</p>\n<p> By authorizing these Services to access your TPS profile, you are authorizing us, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, to collect, store and use any and all information that your privacy settings at the TPS allow our Services to access through the TPS application programming interface (\"API\").\n</p>\n<p> Because the linkage between any TPS and our Services is completely voluntary and our Services' abilities to access your information at the TPS require that linkage, and any information transmitted is controlled by your privacy settings at the TPS, you have a choice of whether or not to disclose such information.\n</p> Links to Third-Party Websites <p> From time to time, our Services may contain links to other websites.\nWe do not exercise any control over these websites, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices or content.\nWe encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when following links from our Services.\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Services.\n</p> Cookies <p> When you visit our websites, they, like most websites, send one or more cookies\u2014small identifiers\u2014to your computer that store information about your session and preferences as well as information that can help improve our Services.\nWhile we do use strictly necessary and functional cookies for basic site functionality, as well as security and fraud investigation purposes, our primary purpose in using all other cookies is to enhance and improve your user experience by understanding and remembering your preferences, and by general tracking of our user trends.\nWe utilize the following types of cookies: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Default cookies: These strictly necessary and functional cookies support and facilitate the provision of Services that you have requested on our websites, and may enable enhanced features.\n</li>\n<li> Additional cookies: These cookies collect information that we utilize to support the measurement of our websites.\nOn specific sites, Wolfram may use third-party cookies when working with outside partners for analytics and to optimize delivery of information that may be of interest to you.\nWe do not have access to read or write such third-party cookies, nor do we directly control the manner in which they may be used.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but can typically be configured to block all cookies or block all third-party cookies.\nPlease be aware that our websites may not have full functionality for you if your browser is set to block some or all cookies.\nDepending on your location, you may also be prompted to provide your consent to all cookies, other than strictly necessary and functional cookies, each time you visit our websites.\nAny information about you collected by us is retained and protected in accordance with the laws governing your location.\n</p>\n<p> To opt out of cookies that allow information to be delivered to you, such as targeted (or \"interest-based\") advertising, via third-party ad groups we may work with, there are options for controlling the ads you receive.\nPlease note, however, that opting out does not prevent you from seeing the ads.\nit only makes them less relevant or tailored to your interests.\nOne way you may opt out can be found at the National Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt Out website here.\n</p> Security <p> We take appropriate measures to ensure the security of our Services.\nThese include precautions to safeguard your PI against loss, theft and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.\n</p>\n<p> Despite our efforts to protect your PI, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the internet may be intercepted.\nYour use of our Services constitutes an acceptance of such risk.\n</p> Accessing Our Data Servers <p> Various Wolfram Services offer some functionality for which they must access our data servers through the internet.\nWhen they do so, our data servers receive information similar to what our web servers receive when you visit our websites, as well as various Service-specific identifying information.\n</p>\n<p> Specifically, using Wolfram|Alpha, or utilizing the Wolfram|Alpha functionality within other Services, will trigger the collection of information about the specific query.\nSome queries may require collecting additional information, such as session information covering the history of Wolfram Mathematica evaluations or the content of Wolfram Finance Platform notebooks containing the Wolfram|Alpha query.\n</p> You can choose to prevent these Services from accessing our servers by disconnecting from the internet or by using the Internet Connectivity item in the Help menu to tell the Service not to connect to the internet.\nIf you choose not to allow these Services to access our servers, our Services will not be able to perform certain functions.\n<p> Under normal circumstances, we will never release information on accesses to our servers.\nWe may, however, release information as described above in Disclosures of Your Information.\n</p> Accessing Our Services from Third-Party Sources <p>\n<em>This section is only applicable to Wolfram|Alpha and the Wolfram Cloud:</em>\n</p>\n<p> These Services may additionally be accessed through web widgets, scripts or gadgets that are embedded on third-party sites.\nIf you choose to access these Services via such tools, then depending on the third-party technology, your PI and input may be passed on to the third party's servers prior to being processed by our Services.\n</p> Data Retention and the GDPR <p> We collect and hold personal data about our customers, users and enthusiasts, employees and others in the European Union who access our resources and services in a manner consistent with the lawful bases as outlined in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nPlease see the Data Retention Policy Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies, which outlines our GDPR compliance in collecting, processing and using your personal data.\nIt also describes how you can contact us to review any personal data and withdraw any consent you have given us to store it.\n</p> California Residents <p> Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, certain rights with respect to our collection of their PI.\nIf you are a California resident, please see the CCPA Addendum to Wolfram's Privacy Policies.\nIt outlines how you may contact us to exercise your rights under California law.\nPlease note that you must verify your identity before further action is taken.\n</p> Our Policy toward Children <p> Wolfram's Services are not directed at children under 13.\nWe do not knowingly collect PI from children under 13.\nIf a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with PI without their consent, they should contact us at myprivacy@wolfram.com.\nIf we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with PI, we will delete such information from our files.\n</p> Changes to This Privacy Policy <p> We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time in the future.\nAny such updates or modifications shall be effective immediately upon their announcement.\nPlease refer often to this document online for the latest information.\n</p> Questions, Concerns and More Information <p> For information on policies related to the use of our Services, see our Legal portal.\n</p>\n<p> If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you may contact us online, by email at myprivacy@wolfram.com or by US mail at Wolfram, Attn: Legal Department, 100 Trade Center Drive, Champaign, IL 61820-7237 USA.\n</p>\n<p> By using our Services, you are telling us either that you are 18 years or older and legally able to form contracts, or that an adult with authority to act on your behalf has agreed to these terms and to be responsible for ensuring your compliance with them in your use of the Services and any results you obtain from them.\nIf you don't want to be bound by these terms, do not use the Services or their results.\n</p>\n<p> Revised September 29, 2020 </p> Legal <ul>\n<li>Privacy
