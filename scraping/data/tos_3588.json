GDPR information</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law, apps must clarify their functions to users and explicitly request user approval before tracking personal data.\nBoth Google and Apple have their own interpretations of GDPR.\nIn order to comply with all requirements, the Gamedock SDK includes a customisable privacy policy menu with accompanying mechanisms that ensure no 3rd party libraries are initialised and no network communication is performed before the user has accepted the privacy policy.</p>\n<p>GDPR law will be enforced starting May 2018, meaning all apps must show a consent popup before collecting data.\nBesides the GDPR deadline, Google has added its own requirements, which will be enforced starting 1 Feb 2018.\nApple hasn\u2019t communicated a hard deadline yet other than May 2018, but we\u2019re taking the same approach as with Google so as to avoid any risks.\nThis means that as of 1 Feb 2018, all games must have the GDPR popup enabled unless the account manager explicitly states it should be disabled.\nPlease align closely with your account manager regarding this matter.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Warning</p>\n<p>\nIt is not allowed to have any network calls before the user accepts the privacy policy, do not initialise any libraries/make any calls before initialising the Gamedock SDK.</p> Implementation in the SDK\nUnity Enable or disable the consent popup<p>By default, the Gamedock SDK will use the default native template screens, if you want to use custom Unity screens select \u2018Use unity prefabs\u2019 on the GamedockSDK GameObject, also make sure to specify the correct orientation.\nThere are 2 default template prefabs provided by the Gamedock SDK, those can be found in the \u2018Resources/Gamedock/PrivacyPolicy\u2019 directory.\nThe 2 prefabs both have to be added to the GamedockSDK gameobject in the privacy policy slots when selecting the \u2018Use unity prefabs\u2019 option.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The user should have an option to change their settings later on while playing the game.\nThe game should offer a button for this which opens the GDPR settings screen, a default settings screen is provided by the Gamedock SDK and can be opened by calling:</p>\n<code>Gamedock.Instance.ShowPrivacyPolicySettings();</code>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied<p>\n</p>\n<p>The user has to restart the app after making changes to the GDPR settings before they take effect.</p>Handling network calls and 3rd party SDK\u2019s<p>By default, the Gamedock SDK handles all the network calls and 3rd party SDK\u2019s within the Gamedock SDK.\nHowever, in case you do send network calls to your own server or load 3rd party SDK\u2019s outside the Gamedock SDK it is important to know that this is only allowed after the user accepted the consent popup.\nWhen the user presses the accept button the following Gamedock SDK method is called for starting the SDK\u2019s own network calls / 3rd party:</p>\n<code>//Callback informing the status of the privacy policy (if it was accepted by the user)\nGamedock.Instance.PrivacyPolicyCallbacks.OnPrivacyPolicyStatus -= OnPrivacyPolicyStatus(bool accepted).\nGamedock.Instance.PrivacyPolicyCallbacks.OnPrivacyPolicyStatus += OnPrivacyPolicyStatus(bool accepted);</code>Copy to clipboardErrorCopiedChanging the header image<p>If you want to set your own custom header image instead of the Azerion logo, you can do so by overwriting the appropriate image file to the following location (if it does not exist, you will need to create it):</p>\n<p>PROJECT_PATH/Assets/Plugins/Android/res/drawable/</p>\n<p>The image files should have the name \u201cprivacy_policy_landscape_custom.png\u201d or \u201cprivacy_policy_portrait_custom.png\u201d depending on your orientation.\nThe image size is 800px x 220px or 600px x 220px.</p>\n<p>For iOS, the header image can be replaced at Gamedock.framework/PrivacyPolicyHeader.png.</p>\n<p>For Unity 2017.1 and above you can use the supplied project found in the SDK bundle under NativeLibraries/Android/Resources.\nBuild this project in Android Studio and make sure to replace the necessary images.</p>\nAIR Enable or disable the privacy policy popup<p>The privacy policy popup can be enabled/configured via parameters when calling Gamedock.GetInstance().Init():</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>showAgeGate</em> Boolean - If enabled, the age gate popup will always appear the first time the user opens the game <strong>before</strong> the GDPR/Privacy Policy popup.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>ageGateShouldBlock</em> Boolean - Gives the possibility for blocking the user from continuing to the game if the minimum age requirement is not met.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>ageGateMinimumAgeRequirement</em> Number - Minimum age in years for users to be able to pass the age gate popup.\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>coppaEnabled</em> Boolean - If enabled, follows COPPA law for protection of minors and makes sure the game never shows a privacy policy menu, age gate menu or ads.</li>\n</ul>Handling privacy policy callbacks / initialising 3rd party libraries<p>The SDK provides feedback information for the choice that the user has made when presented with the privacy policy.\nBy default, the Gamedock SDK handles all the network calls and 3rd party SDK\u2019s within the Gamedock SDK.\nHowever, in case you do send network calls to your own server or load 3rd party SDK\u2019s outside the Gamedock SDK it is important to know that this is only allowed after the user accepted the privacy policy popup.\nIn order to get that feedback, register the following callback:</p>\n<code>//Callback informing the choice for the privacy policy\nGamedock.GetInstance().addEventListener(SDKEvents.PRIVACY_POLICY_STATUS, onPrivacyPolicyStatusEvent).\nprivate function onPrivacyPolicyStatusEvent(evt:PrivacyPolicyStatusEvent) : void\n{ if(evt.accepted) { trace(\"Privacy policy accepted, initialising 3rd party libraries.\").\n// Initialise third party libraries like Google Play Games, Game Center etc.\n}\n}</code>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied<p>The variables returned are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>accepted</em> Boolean - Informs the game if the privacy policy was accepted.</li>\n</ul>Changing the header image<p>If you want to set your own custom header image instead of the Azerion logo, you can do so by replacing the appropriate image files in the GamedockResources.ANE:</p>\n<p>Android:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GamedockResources.ane\\META-INF\\ANE\\Android-ARM\\sdk-resources-res\\drawable\\</li>\n<li>GamedockResources.ane\\META-INF\\ANE\\Android-ARM64\\sdk-resources-res\\drawable\\</li>\n<li>GamedockResources.ane\\META-INF\\ANE\\Android-x86\\sdk-resources-res\\drawable\\</li>\n</ul>\n<p>iOS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gamedock.ane\\META-INF\\ANE\\iPhone-ARM\\</li>\n<li>Gamedock.ane\\META-INF\\ANE\\iPhone-x86\\</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For Android, the image files are named \u201cprivacy_policy_landscape_custom.png\u201d and \u201cprivacy_policy_portrait_custom.png\u201d, for iOS they are called \u201cPrivacyPolicyHeader.png\u201d and \u201cPrivacyPolicyHeaderLandscape.png\u201d, each file is used for landscape/portrait resp.\nThe image size is 800px x 220px or 600px x 220px.</p>Showing the privacy policy settings in-game<p>The user should also have an option to change their privacy policy settings while playing the game.\nThe game should offer a button for this which opens the GDPR settings screen, a default settings screen

JSON.stringify(privacyPolicyStatus)).\n});</code>Copy to clipboardErrorCopiedChanging the header image<p>If you want to set your own custom header image instead of the Azerion logo, you can do so by adding the following images (PNG):</p>\n<p>Android:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/privacy_policy_landscape_custom.png (if your game is in landscape)</li>\n<li>platforms/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/privacy_policy_portrait_custom.png (if your game is in portrait)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>iOS:\n*\n*</p>Showing the privacy policy settings

after making changes to the GDPR settings before they take effect.</p> Changing the consent popup text<p>Note that the text and translations of the popup are kept in the Gamedock SDK Game config feature, which should be by default integrated into your game.\nNote that in case you are working on an update you can fetch the new game config in Unity (we already updated the game config contents).\nOnly in case of explicit requests by your account manager the default text and translations may be changed.\nPlease don\u2019t change this text on your own as this must be legally correct.</p>Manually passing GDPR information<p>If you don\u2019t intend on using the SDK popups, you can also pass and retrieve the GDPR information to the SDK using the following methods:</p>\nUnity <code>Gamedock.Instance.SetGDPRSettings(withPersonalisedAds, withPersonalisedContent).\n//Dictionary contains two keys (withPersonalisedAds, withPersonalisedContent) with the information.\nDictionary&lt;string, bool&gt.\ngdprSettings = Gamedock.Instance.GetGDPRSettings();</code>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nAIR <blockquote>\n<p>This feature is not supported for AIR.</p>\n</blockquote> Cordova <code>gamedockSDK.setGDPRSettings(true, true).\nvar settings = gamedockSDK.getGDPRSettings();</code>Copy to clipboardErrorCopied\nGamedock \u00a9 2019-2021 by Azerion
