\"us\", are to Coinbase Ireland and/or Coinbase Europe depending on the services being discussed, and references to \"you\" or \"your\" are to the person with whom Coinbase enters into this Agreement.</p>\n<p>By signing up to use an account through coinbase.com or pro.coinbase.com, or any of our associated websites, application programming interfaces (\u201c<strong>APIs</strong>\u201d), or mobile applications (collectively the \"<strong>Site</strong>\"), you agree that you have read, understood, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, as well as our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>We refer to the E-Money Services, Digital Currency Services and Additional Services (all defined below) collectively as the \"<strong>Coinbase Services</strong>\", which can be accessed via the platform operated by Coinbase (the \u201c<strong>Coinbase Platform</strong>\u201d) (including the online platform which is accessible via the Site or at such location as may be prescribed by Coinbase from time to time).\nEach of the Coinbase Services is provided by either Coinbase Ireland or Coinbase Europe, as set out in clause 2 below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<strong>You should be aware that the risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currencies can be substantial.\nAs with any asset, the value of Digital Currencies can go up or

<strong>E-Money Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The following services (the \"<strong>E-Money Services</strong>\") may be provided to you by Coinbase Ireland:</p>\n<p>(A) a hosted digital wallet

(\u201c<strong>E-Money</strong>\").\nand</p>\n<p>(B) certain payment services enabling you to send and receive E-Money (as set out below).\n</p>\n<p>The E-Money Services are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.\nCoinbase Ireland is an authorised electronic money institution authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland with register number C188493 and listed on the Central Bank of

regulated entities such as investor or deposit protection schemes or access to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman in relation to the Digital Currency Services.\n</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Additional Coinbase Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the core services (i.e.\nthe E-Money Services and the Digital Currency Services), the following services (\"<strong>Additional

<strong>Several Liability.</strong> You agree that the liability of each of Coinbase Ireland and Coinbase Europe under this Agreement is several and not joint, and each of Coinbase Ireland and

their own breaches of this Agreement, and not for each other\u2019s breaches.</p>\n<p>2.5 <strong>Fees.</strong> You agree to be responsible for the payment of and pay all fees.\nA full list of fees for Coinbase Services, as amended from time to time, can be found on the Site at the \u2018Pricing and Fees Disclosures\u2019 and \u2018Trading Fees\u2019 pages, which shall form part of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>2.6 <strong>Coinbase Group.</strong> In this Agreement, \u201c<strong>Coinbase Group</strong>\u201d means Coinbase Europe and its corporate affiliates, including Coinbase, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, which provide Digital Currency storage and wallet services.\nExcluded from this definition are all corporate affiliates that solely provide electronic money

Coinbase Account.\nWe may, in our sole discretion, refuse to open a Coinbase Account for you, or suspend or terminate any Coinbase Accounts (including but not limited to duplicate accounts) or suspend or terminate the trading of specific Digital Currency in your account.\n</p>\n<p>3.2 <strong>Third party Access.</strong> If, to the extent permitted by <strong>Section 4.10</strong>, you grant express permission to a Regulated Third Party to access or connect to your Coinbase Account(s), either through the Regulated Third Party's product or service or through the Site, you acknowledge that granting permission to a Regulated Third Party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement.\nYou are fully responsible for all acts or omissions of any Regulated Third Party with access to your Coinbase Account(s) and any action of such Regulated Third Party shall be considered to be an action authorised by you.\nFurther, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold Coinbase responsible for, and will indemnify Coinbase from, any liability arising out of or related to any act or omission of any Regulated Third Party with access to your Coinbase Account(s).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You may change or remove permissions granted by you to a Regulated Third Party with respect to your Coinbase Account(s) at any time through the tabs on the \u2018Settings\u2019 page on the Site.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>3.3 <strong>Identity Verification.</strong> You agree to provide us with the information we request (which we may request at any time deemed necessary) for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime, including as set out in <strong>Appendix 2</strong> (<i>Verification Procedures and Limits</i>) and permit us to keep a record of such information.\nYou will need to complete certain verification procedures before you are permitted to start using the Coinbase Services and to access specific Coinbase Services, including certain transfers of E-Money and Digital Currency, and the limits that apply to your use of the Coinbase Services may be altered as a result of information collected on an ongoing basis.</p>\n<p>The information we request may include (but is not limited to) personal information such as your name, residential address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, information regarding your bank account (such as the name of the bank, the account type, routing number, and account number) network status, customer type, customer role, billing type, mobile device identifiers (e.g.\ninternational mobile subscriber identity and international mobile equipment identity) and other subscriber status details, and any such information that Coinbase is required to collect from time to time under applicable law.</p>\n<p>You may also be required to undergo \u201c<strong>Enhanced Due Diligence</strong>\u201d (see <strong>Section 6.2</strong> below), where Coinbase may request that you submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide relevant records, and arrange for meetings with Coinbase staff so that Coinbase may, among other things, establish the source of your wealth and source of funds for any transactions carried out in the course of your use of Coinbase Services.</p>\n<p>In providing us with this or any other information that may be required, you confirm that the information is true, accurate and complete, and you have not withheld any information that may influence Coinbase\u2019s evaluation of you for the purposes of your registration for a Coinbase Account or the provision of Coinbase Services to you.\nYou undertake to promptly notify in writing and provide Coinbase with information regarding any changes in circumstances that may cause any such information provided to become false, inaccurate or incomplete and also undertake to provide any other additional documents, records and information as may be required by Coinbase and/or applicable law.\nYou permit us to keep records of such information.\nWe will treat this information in accordance with <strong>Section 11</strong> (<i>Data Protection</i>).</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<em>You authorise us to make enquiries, whether directly or through third parties, that we consider necessary to verify your identity or protect you and/or us against fraud or other financial crime, and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such enquiries.\nWhen we carry out these enquiries, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be disclosed to credit reference and fraud prevention or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our enquiries in full.\nThis is an identity check only and should have no adverse effect on your credit rating.\nAdditionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Coinbase Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.</em>\n</i>\n</p> 4.\nE-MONEY SERVICES.\n<p>4.1 <strong>Loading.</strong> You can load funds into your E-Money Wallet using bank transfer (or other payment methods available on the Site for your location), and your E-Money Wallet will show loaded funds once we have received them.\nLoading of funds may be done manually, or as part of a recurring transaction that you set up on your Coinbase Account (see <strong>Section 5.12</strong> below for more details).\nYou may only load your own funds, from your own account, and not from any joint, pooled or third party account.\nWhen funds are loaded into the E-Money Wallet you will be issued with E-Money by Coinbase Ireland that represents the funds you have loaded.\nThe E-Money Wallet is not a deposit or investment account which means that your E-Money will not be protected by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme or the Investor Compensation Scheme.\nCoinbase Ireland will only hold funds received from users in a designated safekeeping account with a regulated financial institution.\nE-Money held in an E-Money Wallet will not earn any interest.\nYour E-Money Wallet may hold E-Money denominated in different currencies and we will show the E-Money balance for each currency that you hold.</p>\n<p>4.2 <strong>Purchase or Sale of Digital Currency.</strong> You may purchase supported Digital Currency by using E-Money credited to your E-Money Wallet.\nTo carry out a Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money, you must follow the relevant instructions on the Site.\nA Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money should normally be settled no later than one business day after we receive your instructions.\nYou authorise us to debit E-Money from your E-Money Wallet.\nAlthough we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, E-Money may be debited from your E-Money Wallet before Digital Currency is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\n<p>You may sell Digital Currency in exchange for E-Money.\nYou authorise us to debit your Digital Currency Wallet and credit your E-Money Wallet with the relevant amount of E-Money.\n</p>\n<p>4.3 <strong>Receipt of Instructions.</strong> If we receive instructions from you to purchase Digital Currency using E-Money on a non-business day or after 4:30 pm (Dublin time) on a business day, we may treat those instructions as if they were received by us on the following business day.\n</p>\n<p>4.4 <strong>Revocation.</strong> When you give us instructions to carry out a Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money, you cannot withdraw your consent to that Digital Currency Transaction unless the Digital Currency Transaction is not due to occur until an agreed date in the future e.g.\nif you have set up Future Transactions (see <strong>Section 5.11</strong> below for more details).\nIn the case of a Future Transaction, you may withdraw your consent up until the end of the business day before the date that the Future Transaction is due to take place.\nTo withdraw your consent to a Future Transaction, follow the instructions on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>4.5 <strong>Unsuccessful Payments.</strong> If a payment to load funds into your E-Money Wallet is not successful, you authorise Coinbase, in its sole discretion, either to cancel any related Digital Currency Transactions or to debit your other payment methods, including Coinbase balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the Digital Currency Transactions in question.\nYou are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.\n</p>\n<p>4.6 <strong>Account Information.</strong> You will be able to see your E-Money Wallet balance and your transaction history using the Site, including (i) the amount (and currency) of each Digital Currency Purchase, (ii) a reference to identify the payer and / or payee (as appropriate), (iii) any fees charged (including a breakdown of the fees), (iv) where there has been a currency exchange, the rate of exchange, and the amount (in the new currency) after exchange (where you are the payer) or the amount (in the original currency) before the exchange (where you are the payee), and (v) the debit or credit date of each Digital Currency Purchase (as appropriate).</p>\n<p>4.7 <strong>Redeeming E-Money.</strong> You may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your E-Money Wallet at any time by selecting the relevant option in the Site and following the instructions.\nUnless agreed otherwise, funds will be transferred to the bank account you have registered with us.\nIf this Agreement is terminated, we will redeem any E-Money remaining in your E-Money Wallet and attempt to transfer funds to the bank account you have registered with us.\nPrior to redeeming E-Money from your E-Money Wallet, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes, and as required by applicable law.\nThis may mean you are prevented or delayed from withdrawing E-Money until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our regulatory requirements.\n</p>\n<p>4.8 <strong>Unauthorised and Incorrect Transactions.</strong> Where a purchase of Digital Currency and / or redemption of E-Money is initiated from your E-Money Wallet using your credentials, we will assume that you authorised such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.</p>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction using your E-Money Wallet has been carried out that you did not authorise (an \u201c<strong>Unauthorised Transaction</strong>\u201d), or if you have reason to believe that a transaction using your E-Money Wallet has been incorrectly carried out or is not complete (an \u201c<strong>Incorrect Transaction</strong>\u201d), you must contact us as soon as possible, and in any case no later than 13 months after the Unauthorised Transaction or Incorrect Transaction occurred.\n</p>\n<p>It is important that you regularly check your E-Money Wallet balance and your transaction history to ensure any Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>\n<p>We are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this <strong>Section 4.8</strong>, in which case <strong>Section 4.9</strong> below sets out our respective responsibilities.\nAs further described in <strong>Section 4.9</strong> below, we are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions if you have acted fraudulently, intentionally or with gross negligence and this has resulted in the Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions.</p>\n<p>During any investigation of any actual or potential Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions, we reserve the right to suspend your Coinbase Account to avoid further losses.</p>\n<p>4.9 <strong>Refund Rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(A) <strong>Unauthorised Transactions - E-Money Wallet.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If an Unauthorised Transaction occurs in your E-Money Wallet as a result of our failure, we will refund you the amount of that transaction by no later than the end of the next business day after becoming aware of the Unauthorised Transaction and restore your E-Money Wallet to the state it would have been in had the Unauthorised Transaction not taken place.\nGenerally, you will not be liable for losses incurred after you have notified us of the Unauthorised Transaction or if we have failed at any time to provide you with the means for notifying us.\n</p>\n<p>You will be liable for the first EUR 50 of any losses you incur in respect of an Unauthorised Transaction in your E-Money Wallet which arises from the use of lost or stolen credentials (for example when you have failed to keep the login details for your Coinbase Account secure), and if you are fraudulent, or you intentionally or negligently fail to carry out your obligations under this Agreement and this results in Unauthorised Transactions in your E-Money Wallet (for example, if you deliberately share your email and password with a third party, or are grossly negligent in keeping your email and password secure, in both cases other than in accordance with Sections 3.2 and/or 4.10), you will be liable for all resultant losses incurred as a result of any such Unauthorised Transactions, not just the first EUR 50.\n</p>\n<p>Where there is a dispute between us and you regarding whether or not a transaction is an Unauthorised Transaction, we may (but are not obliged to) temporarily credit your E-Money Wallet whilst we settle the dispute.\nWhere we determine that the transaction was authorised, we may reverse that credit and correct errors made in any statement of E-Money Wallet without prior notice to you, although please note that during this period your E-Money Wallet may be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorised Transactions.\nYou will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any E-Money you have transferred which was temporarily credited to your E-Money Wallet.</p>\n<p>(B) <strong>Incorrect Transactions - E-Money Wallet.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where an Incorrect Transaction is made in your E-Money Wallet as a result of our action or error we shall refund to you the amount of that transaction without undue delay and restore your E-Money Wallet to the state in which it would have been had the Incorrect Transaction not taken place.\nWe will also endeavour to provide you with reasonable notice where possible.\nWe will also pay any charges for which we are responsible, and for any interest which you can show that you have had to pay as a consequence of any Incorrect Transaction.\nIrrespective of our liability, on your request, we shall try to trace any Incorrect Transaction initiated by you free of charge.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to trace such transactions.</p>\n<p>4.10 <strong>Appointment of Regulated Third Parties.</strong> You may, as set out in <strong>Section 3.2</strong>, appoint appropriately regulated third parties to access your E-Money Wallet (\u201c<strong>Regulated Third Parties</strong>\u201d).\nIf you do so, you should be aware that by virtue of such access, that Regulated Third Party may access your transactional and other data, and / or may initiate transfers from your E-Money Wallet.\n<u>You will be liable for any actions that any Regulated Third Parties take on your Coinbase Account, as further set out in <strong>Section 3.2</strong> above.\nWe reserve the right to refuse access to any Regulated Third Parties, as set out in <strong>Section 4.11</strong> below.</u>\n</p>\n<p>4.11 <strong>Refusing to deal with Regulated Third Parties.</strong> We may refuse access to Regulated Third Parties for objectively justified and duly evidenced reasons relating to unauthorised or fraudulent access to your E-Money Wallet, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime, and as required by applicable law.\nIn such cases, unless we are prohibited by applicable law, we will inform you that that Regulated Third Party's access has been denied and the reasons why.\nWe will permit access again once we are satisfied that the reasons for refusing access no longer exist.\n</p>\n<p>4.12 <strong>Consent.</strong> By opening a Coinbase Account with us you provide your explicit consent to us providing E-Money Services to you.\nYou can withdraw this consent at any time by closing your Coinbase Account.\n</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this consent does not relate to our processing of your personal information or your rights under and in accordance with data protection law and regulations.\nPlease see <strong>Section 11</strong> (<i>Data Protection</i>) below and our Privacy Policy for information about how we process your personal data, and the rights you have in respect of this.</p>\n<p>4.13 <strong>Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</strong> If you have a complaint relating to the E-Money Services provided to you by Coinbase Ireland, and that complaint cannot be resolved through the dispute process set out in <strong>Section 10.3</strong>, you may then be able to take unresolved complaints to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (\"<strong>FSPO</strong>\").\nYou agree that you will not raise a complaint with the FSPO until the dispute process set out in <strong>Section 10.3</strong> has been completed.\nYou can find further information about the FSPO and the types of complainants eligible to submit matters to the FSPO using the following details:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Address:</strong> Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, Lincoln House, Lincoln Place, Dublin 2, D02VH29, Ireland</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Telephone:</strong> +353 1 567 7000</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Email:</strong> info@fspo.ie </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Website:</strong> https://www.fspo.ie/</p> 5.\nDIGITAL CURRENCY SERVICES.\n<p>5.1 <strong>In General.</strong> Your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Digital Currency from, other users or third parties outside the Coinbase Platform, by giving instructions through the Site (each such transaction is a \"<strong>Digital Currency Transaction</strong>\").</p>\n<p>The Digital Currency exchange service enables you to buy Digital Currency on the Coinbase Platform using:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(A) E-Money from your E-Money Wallet;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(B) Central bank issued currency (such as EUR or GBP) supported by Coinbase.\nand/or</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(C) Other types of Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\n<p>Conversely, when you sell Digital Currency on the Coinbase Platform, you may elect to receive:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(D) E-Money into your E-Money Wallet;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(E) Central bank issued currency (such as EUR or GBP) supported by Coinbase.\nand/or</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(F) Other types of Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\n<p>Coinbase facilitates and enables the purchase and sale of Digital Currency between its customers on the Coinbase Platform.</p>\n<p>5.2 <strong>Fiat Currency Transactions (not using your E-Money Wallet)</strong> You may purchase supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method to your Digital Currency Wallet.\nYou authorise us to debit funds using your selected payment method(s) to complete your purchase.</p>\n<p>Although we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your selected payment method before the status of your Digital Currency Transaction is shown as complete, and the Digital Currency is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet.\nYou may sell Digital Currency in exchange for fiat currency (such as EUR or GBP) supported by Coinbase.\nIn such circumstances, you authorise us to debit your Digital Currency Wallet and to send instructions to credit your selected payment method(s) in settlement of sell transactions.\nWe will send these instructions as soon as reasonably possible.\nAny fiat currency should be credited to your selected payment method(s) by the end of the business day after we send such instructions.\n</p>\n<p>5.3 <strong>Transaction Fulfilment.</strong> We will make reasonable efforts to fulfil all purchases of Digital Currency, but in some circumstances, we may be unable to.\nIf this is the case, we will notify you and seek your approval to re-attempt the purchase at the current Exchange Rate (as defined below).\n</p>\n<p>5.4 <strong>Availability of Payment Methods.</strong> The availability of a method of payment depends on a number of factors including, for example, where you are located, the identification information you have provided to us, and limitations imposed by third party payment processors.</p>\n<p>5.5 <strong>Conversion Fees.</strong> Each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is subject to a fee (a \"<strong>Conversion Fee</strong>\").\nThe applicable Conversion Fee will be displayed to you on the Site prior to each transaction and is stated in each receipt we issue to you.\nWe may adjust our Conversion Fees at any time.\nWe will not process a transaction if the Conversion Fee and any other associated fees would, together, exceed the value of your transaction.\nA full list of Coinbase Europe's fees can be found on our Pricing and Fees Disclosures page.</p>\n<p>5.6 <strong>Exchange Rates.</strong> Each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is also subject to the Exchange Rate for the given transaction.\nThe \"Exchange Rate\" means the price of a given supported Digital Currency in fiat currency as quoted on the Site.\nThe Exchange Rate is stated either as a \"Buy Price\" or as a \"Sell Price\", which is the price at which you may buy or sell Digital Currency, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the Buy Price Exchange Rate may not be the same as the Sell Price Exchange Rate at any given time, and that we may add a margin or \u2018spread\u2019 to the quoted Exchange Rate.\nYou agree to accept the Exchange Rate when you authorise a transaction.\nYou can learn more about Coinbase Europe's Exchange Rates on our \u2018Pricing and Fees Disclosures\u2019 page on the Site.\nWe do not guarantee the availability of any Exchange Rate.\nWe do not guarantee that you will be able to buy and / or sell your Digital Currency on the open market at any particular price or time.\n</p>\n<p>5.7 <strong>Authorisations.\nReversals.\nCancellations.</strong> By clicking the \u2018Buy\u2019 or \u2018Sell\u2019 button on the Site, you are authorising Coinbase to initiate the transaction at the quoted Buy Price or Sell Price and agree to any associated Conversion Fees and Exchange Fees and any other fees.</p>\n<p>You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending.\nIf your payment is not successful or if your payment method has insufficient funds, you authorise us, in our sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including balances on your E-Money Wallet and/or Digital Currency Wallets, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction.\nYou are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.\nCoinbase reserves the right to suspend access to Coinbase Services (including Coinbase Consumer, Coinbase Pro) until such insufficient payment is addressed.</p>\n<p>5.8 <strong>Digital Currency Transactions.</strong> We will process Digital Currency Transactions in accordance with the instructions we receive from you.\nYou should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us.\nWe do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other third party and we will have no liability or responsibility for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate and complete.\n</p>\n<p>Digital Currency Transactions cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network.\nIf you initiate a Digital Currency Transaction by entering the recipient's email address and the recipient does not have an existing Coinbase Account, we will invite the recipient to open a Coinbase Account.\nIf the recipient does not open a Coinbase Account within 30 days, we will return the relevant Digital Currency to your Digital Currency Wallet.\n</p>\n<p>We may charge network fees (\u201c<strong>miner fees</strong>\u201d) to process a Digital Currency Transaction on your behalf.\nWe will calculate the miner fees at our discretion, although we will always notify you of the miner fees at (or before) the time you authorise the Digital Currency Transaction.\nA full list of Coinbase Europe's miner fees can be found on our \u2018Pricing and Fees Disclosures\u2019 page on the Site.\nMiner fees for each individual transaction will be disclosed to you at the time of purchase on the checkout page.\nWhen you or a third party sends Digital Currency to a Coinbase Digital Currency Wallet from an external wallet not hosted on Coinbase, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of miner fees in order for the transaction to be completed successfully.\nNon-payment of miner fees may cause your transaction to remain in a pending state outside of Coinbase Europe\u2019s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.</p>\n<p>Once submitted to a Digital Currency network, a Digital Currency Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network.\nA Digital Currency Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state.\nDigital Currency associated with Digital Currency Transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly and will not be included in your Digital Currency Wallet balance or be available to conduct Digital Currency Transactions until confirmed by the network.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We may also refuse to process or cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required by law, regulation or any court or other authority to which Coinbase is subject in any jurisdiction, for instance, if there is suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.9 <strong>Supported Digital Currencies.</strong> Our Digital Currency Services are available only in connection with those digital currencies that Coinbase supports (\u201c<strong>Supported Digital Currencies</strong>\u201d), and this may change from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies in any form that we do not support.\nWe assume no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet for digital currencies that we do not support.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Coinbase bears no responsibility and is not liable for any unsupported asset that is sent to a wallet associated with your Coinbase Account.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about which Digital Currencies we currently support, please visit <strong>https://help.coinbase.com.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.10 <strong>Ending support of a Digital Currency.</strong> Coinbase may in its sole discretion terminate support for any Digital Currency.\nCoinbase will provide you no less than 10 days notice (unless a shorter period is required by applicable law or a regulatory authority) via email to the email address associated with your Coinbase account to announce the end of such support.\nIf you do not sell or send such Digital Currency off platform during this time, Coinbase reserves the right to withdraw such Digital Currencies from your account and credit your Coinbase account with the market value of a supported Digital Currency or a fiat currency (which denomination will be selected in our reasonable discretion).</p>\n<p>5.11 <strong>USDC Wallets.</strong> Where available, you may also elect to buy USD Coin through Coinbase, a Digital Currency fully collateralized by the US Dollar, which is issued by Circle Internet Financial (\u201c<strong>Circle</strong>\u201d) and supported by Coinbase (\u201c<strong>USDC</strong>\u201d).\nYou are the owner of the balance of your \u201c<strong>USDC Wallet</strong>\u201d (i.e.\nthe Digital Currency Wallet provided to you by Coinbase Europe to hold USDC and through which Digital Currency Transactions in USDC can be carried out).\nCoinbase is not the issuer of USDC, does not hold U.S.\nDollars (\u201c<strong>USD</strong>\u201d) on reserve for USDC holders, and has no obligation to repurchase your USDC for USD.\nYou can redeem your USDC with Circle, and Coinbase may also elect to repurchase your USDC in exchange for USD.\nYou agree to be bound by the terms of the Circle USDC Agreement (located at https://support.usdc.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001233386-Circle-USDC-User-Agreement), which provides additional obligations, undertakings, and limitations with respect to USDC.</p>\n<p>5.12 <strong>Recurring Digital Currency Transactions.</strong> If you set up a recurring purchase of Digital Currency (a \"<strong>Future Transaction</strong>\"), you authorise us to initiate recurring electronic payments in accordance with your selected Digital Currency Transaction and any corresponding payment accounts, such as direct debits from, or credits to, your linked bank account.\nYour Future Transactions will occur in identical, periodic instalments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Coinbase cancels the Future Transaction.\n</p>\n<p>If you select a bank account as your payment method for a Future Transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or public holiday in the location in which the relevant bank is located, or after the relevant bank\u2019s business hours, the credit or debit will be executed on the next business day, although the Digital Currency fees at the time of the regularly-scheduled transaction will apply.\nIf your bank is unable to process any payment to Coinbase, we will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may avail ourselves of remedies set forth in this Agreement to recover any amount owed to Coinbase.\nThis authorisation will remain in full force and effect until you change your Future Transaction settings or until you provide us with written notice via https://help.coinbase.com.\nYou agree to notify Coinbase in writing of any changes in your linked bank account information prior to a Future Transaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Coinbase may, at any time, terminate Future Transactions by providing notice to you.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.13 <strong>Supplemental Protocols Excluded.</strong> Unless specifically announced on the Site or via an official public statement of Coinbase, Supported Digital Currencies excludes all other protocols and/or functionality which supplement or interact with the Supported Digital Currency.\nThis exclusion includes but is not limited to: metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins or other functionality, such as staking, protocol governance, and/or any smart contract functionality, which may supplement or interact with a Supported Digital Currency (collectively, \u201c<strong>Supplemental Protocols</strong>\u201d).\nDo not use your Coinbase Account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction or functionality involving any such Supplemental Protocols, as the Coinbase Platform is not configured to detect, secure, or process these transactions and functionalities.\nAny attempted transactions in such items will result in loss of the item.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You acknowledge and agree that Supplemental Protocols are excluded from Supported Digital Currency and that Coinbase has no liability for any losses related to Supplemental Protocols.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.14 <strong>Operation of Digital Currency Protocols.</strong> We do not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our platform.\nGenerally, the underlying protocols are \u2018open source\u2019 and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and we are not able to guarantee the functionality or security of network operations.\nYou acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software protocols relating to any Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet may change.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In particular, the underlying protocols are likely to be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including \u201c<strong>forks</strong>\u201d).\nAny such material operating changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality, and/or the name of the Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet.\nCoinbase does not control the timing and features of these material operating changes.\nIt is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information and information that may be provided by Coinbase in determining whether to continue to transact in the affected Digital Currency using your Coinbase Account.\nIn the event of any such operational change, Coinbase reserves the right to takes such steps as may be necessary to protect the security and safety of assets held on the Coinbase Platform, including temporarily suspending operations for the involved digital currency(ies), and other necessary steps.\nCoinbase will use its best efforts to provide you notice of its response to any material operating change.\nhowever, such changes are outside of Coinbase\u2019s control and may occur without notice to Coinbase.\nCoinbase\u2019s response to any material operating change is subject to its sole discretion and includes deciding not to support any new digital currency, fork, or other actions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You acknowledge and accept the risks of operating changes to Digital Currency protocols and agree that Coinbase is not responsible for such operating changes and not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules.\nYou acknowledge and accept that Coinbase has sole discretion to determine its response to any operating change and that we have no responsibility to assist you with unsupported currencies or protocols</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.15 <strong>Digital Currency Storage &amp.\nTransmission Delays.</strong> The Coinbase Group securely stores Digital Currency private keys, in a combination of online and offline storage.\nOur security protocols may delay the initiation or crediting of a Digital Currency Transaction.</p>\n<p>5.16 <strong>Third party Payments.</strong> We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or receive from, or sell or transfer to, any third party (including other users of the Digital Currency Services).\nWe are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so.\nIf you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, any third party using Digital Currency transferred using the Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.</p>\n<p>If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Coinbase Support at: trust@coinbase.com so that we may consider what action to take, if any.</p>\n<p>5.17 <strong>Coinbase Vaults.</strong> Coinbase does not support the use of multisig vaults.\nYou may elect to use other services, such as the Coinbase Vault, which allow you to set withdrawal time-delays and create other conditions around the custody and transfer of your Digital Currency.\nAdditional rules associated with such product(s) and service(s) may apply.\nFor more information on Coinbase Vaults, please visit: https://help.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2877996-vaults-faq?b_id=13521.\n</p>\n<p>5.18 <strong>Digital

Currency Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Currency.\nNo company within the Coinbase Group shall have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Digital Currency held in your Digital Currency Wallet.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(B) None of the Digital Currencies in your Digital Currency Wallet are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to,

Digital Currency Wallet.\nAt any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Digital Currency by sending it to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(D) In order to more securely hold customer Digital Currency, the Coinbase Group may use shared blockchain addresses, controlled by a member of the Coinbase Group, to hold Digital Currencies held on behalf of customers and/or held on behalf of Coinbase Europe.\nCustomers\u2019 Digital Currency is segregated from the Coinbase Group\u2019s (including Coinbase Europe\u2019s) own Digital Currency or funds by way of separate ledger accounting entries for customer and Coinbase Group accounts.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Coinbase Group shall not have any obligation to use different blockchain addresses to store Digital Currencies owned by you and Digital Currencies owned by other customers or by the Coinbase

<p>\n<strong>1.\nGeneral.</strong> When you hold Digital Currencies with Coinbase Europe you may be given the option to \u201cstake\u201d these assets in a third party proof of stake network via staking services provided by Coinbase Europe.\nIn a proof of stake network, transaction validators are chosen using a formula based on ownership of the underlying Digital Currency as opposed to computing power (i.e., proof of work).\nPlease visit our staking information page for further details on how proof of stake works.\nStaking services are not available for Digital Currencies held on Coinbase Pro.\nBy using these staking services you accept the terms for such services as set out in this <strong>Appendix 6</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nStaking Service is Optional.</strong> Staking services will be made available to you by default for Digital Currencies where staking functionality is available from Coinbase EUROPE.\nYOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO STAKE WITH COINBASE EUROPE AND YOU CAN OPT-OUT OF COINBASE EUROPE STAKING SERVICES AT ANY TIME THROUGH THE SETTINGS PAGE IN YOUR ACCOUNT.\nIf you opt-out of staking services, you can opt back in at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nThe Service.\nRewards.\nCommission.</strong> If you stake your assets with us, Coinbase Europe or one of its affiliates will stake these on your behalf, acting as a transaction validator on the applicable network for the Digital Currency you stake.\nIf Coinbase Europe or one of its affiliates successfully validates a block of transactions in that Digital Currency, you may earn a reward granted by that Digital Currency\u2019s network.\nYour reward will be determined by the protocols of the applicable network.\nCoinbase Europe will distribute this reward to you after receipt by Coinbase Europe, minus a 25% commission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nNo guarantee.</strong> You have no right to a reward until it is received by Coinbase Europe.\nRewards will be distributed to your account promptly after they are received by Coinbase Europe.\nCoinbase Europe or one of its affiliates will use reasonable efforts to stake any Digital Currencies for which you are using Coinbase Europe staking services.\nThe \u201cstaking rewards rate\u201d disclosed by Coinbase Europe for a particular Digital Currency is an annualized historical rate based on the staking rewards generated by Coinbase Europe in providing staking services to Coinbase Europe customers for that Digital Currency over the last 90 days.\nThis rate is an estimate and changes over time.\nCOINBASE EUROPE DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE STAKING REWARDS, ANY SPECIFIC STAKING REWARD, OR ANY STAKING RETURN OVER TIME, INCLUDING THE STAKING REWARDS RATE.</p>\n<br>\n<small>\u00a9 2020 Coinbase</small> Products Buy/Sell Cryptocurrency Coinbase Pro Coinbase Prime Developer Platform Coinbase Commerce Learn Buy Bitcoin Buy Bitcoin Cash Buy Ethereum

fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator's rules or applicable law.\nApart from the foregoing, each party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the party may incur.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance with Laws.</strong> You must comply with all laws in using the Market Data and you will reasonably cooperate with us to enable

assigns.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability.</strong> In the event any part of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, you and Coinbase authorize a court of competent jurisdiction to make the

Rules <p>Coinbase Markets is Coinbase's set of limit order books that are accessed by clients through the Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Prime trading platforms.\nThe following set of Trading Rules governs orders placed via these trading platforms.</p> 1.\nTrading on Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Prime <p>1.1 Coinbase operates a central limit order book trading platform, and settles trades in a number of Digital Asset and Fiat Currency Trading Pairs.\nEach Trader\u2019s Account will list which Order Books are available to the Trader.</p> 1.2 Orders <p>1.21 To place an Order on an Order Book, a Trader must have an Available Balance of the relevant Asset in their Account which is sufficient to cover the total value of the Order plus any applicable fees.</p>\n<p>1.22 When a Trader places an Order, that quantity of the relevant Asset becomes subject to a Hold.</p>\n<p>1.23 A Trader can place an Order as either a Limit Order, a Market Order, or a Stop Order.</p>\n<p>1.24 A Trader may cancel an open Maker Order or Stop Order at any time before it is Filled.\nNo fees are charged for canceled Orders.</p> 1.3 Limit Orders <p>1.31 A Limit Order is an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an Asset at a specified price.</p>\n<p>1.32 A Limit Order will only ever Fill at the specified price or a better price.</p>\n<p>1.33 A Limit Order with \u2018post-only\u2019 selected will only be posted to the Order Book if it would not be posted at the same price as an existing Order on the Order Book.\nA Limit Order with \u2018post-only\u2019 selected will always be a Maker Order.</p>\n<p>1.34 A Limit Order without \u2018post-only\u2019 selected will be immediately posted to the Order Book (subject to any Time in Force Instructions) and can result in a Maker Order or a Taker Order, or an Order that is partially a Maker Order and partially a Taker Order.</p>\n<p>1.35 Limit Orders may be placed with one of the following Time in Force Instructions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good til canceled: if posted, the Order will remain on the Order Book until canceled by the Trader.\nThis is the default Time in Force Instruction.</li>\n<li>Immediate or Cancel: the Order will only be posted to the Order Book to the extent that it would be immediately Filled.\nany remaining quantity is canceled.\nThis results in a Taker Order.</li>\n<li>Fill or Kill: the Order will only be posted to the Order Book if it would be immediately and completely Filled.\nThis results in a Taker Order.</li>\n</ul> 1.4 Market Orders <p>1.41 A Market Order is an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an Asset at the best available price of existing Orders on the Order Book.</p>\n<p>1.42 There is no guarantee that a Market Order will Fill at the price specified.\nA Market Order may Fill at a number of different prices, based on the quantity of the Market Order and the quantities of the existing Orders on the Order Book at the time.</p>\n<p>1.43 Depending on the volume and prices of Orders on the Order Book at the time when a Market Order is posted, the Market Order may Fill at a price less favorable than the most recent trade price, in some cases significantly so.\nThis is commonly referred to as \u2018slippage\u2019.</p>\n<p>1.44 A valid Market Order will be immediately posted to the Order Book.\nA Market Order is always a Taker Order.</p> 1.5 Stop Orders <p>1.51 A Stop Order is an instruction to post an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of an Asset but only if and when the last trade price on the Order Book equals or surpasses the Stop Price.</p>\n<p>1.52 Once a Stop Order has been placed, it is considered \u2018active\u2019 until it executes by posting the relevant Order when the Stop Price is triggered.</p>\n<p>1.53 A Stop Order is not posted to the Order Book and is not visible to other Traders, but any resulting Order is posted and visible.\nAll Stop Orders are placed without 'post-only' enabled.</p>\n<p>1.54 A Stop Order must be placed as a Stop Limit Order which posts a Limit Order when the Stop Price is triggered.</p>\n<p>1.55 A Stop Limit Order is not guaranteed to Fill.\nThe Web Interface will display a warning each time a Trader attempts to place a Stop Order.</p>\n<p>1.56 Stop Orders may be placed with one of the following Time in Force Instructions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good til canceled: if posted, the Order will remain on the Order Book until canceled by the Trader.\nThis is the default Time in Force Instruction.</li>\n<li>Good til time: if posted, the Order will remain on the order book until a certain time is reached or the Order is canceled by the trader.</li>\n</ul> Warnings <p>The Web Interface will display a warning to Traders who attempt to place an Order which would completely or partially fill at a price which is more than 2% away from the last trade price (slippage warning).</p> 1.6 Posting of Orders to the Order Book <p>1.61 (Taker Order) If an Order is posted to the Order Book at the same price as one or more existing Orders, it is a Taker Order which will result in an immediate Fill at that price, to the extent of the total quantity of those existing Orders.</p>\n<p>1.62 (Maker Order) To the extent that an Order is posted to the Order Book at a different price to all existing Orders, it is a Maker Order which will remain open at that price on the Order Book until:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is canceled by the Trader;</li>\n<li>It expires due to a Time in Force Instruction.\nor</li>\n<li>It is completely Filled by one or more Taker Orders placed by another Trader at the same price.</li>\n</ul> Order Protections <p>1.63 Market Orders and Limit Orders are subject to a 10% protection point.\nMarket and Limit orders will fill at prices up to 10% from the mid-point price between the best bid and best offer on the Order Book at the time the order was placed.\nIf a Market or Limit Order would fill against orders beyond the protection point, the Order will partially fill up to the 10% price level and the matching engine will cancel all remaining portions of the Order.</p> Order Minimums/Maximums <p>1.64 Order Minimums: All Market Orders, Limit Orders, and Stop Orders placed on Coinbase Markets are subject to the minimum order size requirements listed at https://pro.coinbase.com/markets.</p>\n<p>1.65 Order Maximums: All Market Orders, Limit Orders without 'post-only' selected, and Stop Orders placed on Coinbase Markets are subject to the maximum order sizes listed at https://pro.coinbase.com/markets.</p>\n<p>1.66 'Post-only' Limit Orders do not have a maximum order size.\nThe size can be in any increment of the base currency above the minimum order size requirements.</p>\n<p>1.67 Updating Order Parameters: Coinbase Markets will periodically update these Order Minimums, Order Maximums, and total number of Orders allowed per Order Book to reflect the current state of our marketplace and the notional value of the assets.\nhttps://pro.coinbase.com/market</p> 1.7 Matching Engine and Order Priority <p>1.71 Coinbase Markets matches Taker Orders with Open Maker Orders on each Order Book based on Price-Time Priority.</p>\n<p>1.72 Price-Time Priority means that each time a Taker Order is posted:\nThe Taker Order is matched with the earliest in time Maker Order at the best price on the Order Book.\nand\nTo the extent that the Taker Order is not completely Filled by that Maker Order, it is matched with any subsequent Maker Orders at that price, in the sequence those Maker Orders were posted.\nand\nTo the extent that the Taker Order is not completely Filled by one or more Maker Orders described above, it is matched with one or more Maker Orders at the next best price, in the sequence those Maker Orders were posted, and this process is repeated until the Taker Order is completely Filled.</p>\n<p>1.73 All Traders on accessing Coinbase Markets are subject to the same Price-Time Priority.</p>\n<p>1.74 Subject to Time in Force Instructions, an Order may be matched with a number of corresponding Orders at the same price.</p>\n<p>1.75 Taker Orders are matched with the best available existing Maker Orders.\nThis means that a Limit Order placed outside the market (i.e.\na sell Order below the highest existing buy Order, or a buy Order above the lowest existing Sell Order) will be Filled by the best available existing Order rather than an existing Order with the same price as the Limit Order.</p> 1.8 Fills and Settlement <p>1.81 When a Maker Order is matched with a Taker Order, those Orders are Filled.\nAn Order may be matched with and Filled by one or more Orders at the same price.</p>\n<p>1.82 Coinbase Markets settles all Filled Orders immediately, by debiting and crediting the relevant balances of Assets in both Traders\u2019 Accounts.</p>\n<p>1.83 Subject to daily withdrawal limits a Trader may immediately withdraw all Assets in their Account.</p> 1.9 Trading Fees <p>1.91 Coinbase Pro and Coinbase Prime charge a Maker fee for each Maker Order and a Taker fee for each Taker Order that is posted to the Order Book.\nThe fee is charged in the Quote Asset and is calculated as a percentage of the Order quantity.</p>\n<p>1.92 A fee is charged by debiting the Trader\u2019s Available Balance for the amount of the fee at the time that the Order is posted.</p>\n<p>1.93 If an Order is posted to the Order Book partially as a Maker Order and partially as a Taker Order, a Maker fee applies to the portion posted as a Maker Order and a Taker fee applies to the portion posted as a Taker Order.</p>\n<p>1.94 Fees may vary between Order Books.\nThe current fee rates can be found at pro.coinbase.com/fees and prime.coinbase.com/fees.</p>\n<p>1.95 Volume-based fee discounts are available to all traders based on trades over the trailing 30 day period across all order books.</p> 2.\nMarket Integrity <p>\n<strong>All Trades are Final</strong>\n</p>\n<p>2.1 All Fills are final and will not be reversed

from Cancel-Only Mode via @CoinbaseMarkets on Twitter or status.pro.coinbase.com and status.prime.coinbase.com</p> 2.4 Self-trade Prevention <p>2.41 Traders are not able to place an Order which would result in self-execution\u2014i.e., where the same Trader would act as both the maker and taker for the trade.</p>\n<p>2.42 If two Orders of the same quantity would result in self-execution, both Orders are canceled.</p>\n<p>2.43 If two Orders of different quantities would result in self-execution, the smaller Order is canceled and the larger order is decremented by an amount equivalent to the smaller quantity.\nThe remainder of the larger order remains Open.</p> 2.5 Flash Crashes and Circuit Breakers <p>2.51 Coinbase Markets does not use circuit breakers or automated trading halts based on

marketing purposes.</p> WHY WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES <p>We take care to allow your personal information to be accessed only by those who require access to perform their tasks and duties, and to share only with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it.\n<strong>CB will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent</strong>.\nWe will only share your information in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>With third party identity verification services in order to prevent fraud.\nThis allows CB to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases.\nThese service providers may create derivative data based on your personal information that can be used in connection with the provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services.\nFor example: <ul>\n<li>We may use Jumio Corporation or Jumio UK, Limited (collectively \u201cJumio\u201d) to verify your identify by determining whether a selfie you take matches the photo in your government issued identity document.\nThe information collected from your photo may include biometric data.\nJumio's Privacy Policy, available at https://www.jumio.com/legal-information/privacy-policy/jumio-inc-privacy-policy-for-online-services/, describes its collection and use of personal information.</li>\n<li>We may use Sift Science, Inc.\n(\u201cSift\u201d) to detect and prevent fraudulent activity on your account in real time.\nInformation shared with Sift is treated by Sift in accordance with its Privacy Policy, available at https://sift.com/service-privacy.</li>\n<li>If you are based in the US, CB may use Plaid, Inc.\n(\"Plaid\") to connect your Coinbase

faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement or any other applicable policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you establish a CB Account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a CB website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information will be subject to their privacy policies.</p> THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES <p>If you authorize one or more third-party applications to access your CB Services, then information you have provided to CB may be shared with those third parties.\nA connection you authorize or enable between your CB account and a non-CB account, payment instrument, or platform is considered an \u201caccount connection.\u201d Unless you provide further permissions, Coinbase will not authorize these third parties to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using CB Services.\nPlease note that third parties you interact with may have their own privacy policies, and CB is not responsible for their operations or their use of data they collect.\nInformation collected by third parties, which may include such things as contact details, financial information, or location data, is governed by their privacy practices and Coinbase is not responsible for unauthorized third-party conduct.\nWe encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>\n<p>Examples of account connections include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Merchants</strong>: If you use your CB account to conduct a transaction with a third party merchant, the merchant may provide data about you and your transaction to us.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your Financial Services Providers</strong>: For example, if you send us funds from your bank account, your bank will provide us with identifying information in addition to information about your account in order to complete the transaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third-party's privacy practices.\nPlease review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your personal information.\nCoinbase is not responsible for such third party conduct.</p> SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO COINBASE CARD USERS <p>If you sign up to use the Digital Currency backed debit card Service (the \u201cCoinbase Card\u201d) provided by CB via the dedicated app for that Service (the \u201cCoinbase Card App\u201d), we will process your personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<p>In order to provide the Coinbase Card Service to you, we have partnered with Paysafe Financial Services Limited and Paysafe Payment Solution Limited (collectively \u201cPaysafe\u201d).\nPaysafe is the issuer of the Coinbase Card and is a member of the Visa and Mastercard card schemes, one of which will be used to enable your Coinbase Card to operate as a normal debit card.\nWhen you sign up on the Coinbase Card App you agree to Paysafe's own terms and conditions and Privacy Policy (available at https://www.paysafe.com/paysafegroup/privacy-policy/), and as a result Paysafe will be an independent data controller in relation to the personal information they collect and hold relating to you.</p>\n<p>We may at times need to share some of your personal information that we control with Paysafe to enable us and Paysafe to provide you with the Coinbase Card Service.\nWhere we do this, Paysafe will act as a data processor and only process your personal information to the extent necessary to enable us and Paysafe to provide the Coinbase Card Service to you.</p> HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION <p>We understand how important your privacy is, which is why CB maintains (and contractually requires third parties it shares your information with to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.</p>\n<p>We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank account and/or routing numbers, in the US and elsewhere in the world where our facilities or our service providers are located.\nWe protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>For example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities.\nFull credit card data is securely transferred and hosted off-site by payment vendors like Worldpay, (UK) Limited, Worldpay Limited, or Worldpay AP Limited (collectively \u201cWorldpay\u201d) in compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).\nThis information is not accessible to CB or Coinbase staff.\nFor more information about how Worldpay stores and uses your information, please see Worldpay's Privacy Policy at https://www.worldpay.com/uk/worldpay-privacy-notice.</p>\n<p>However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorized acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur.\nPlease recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information.\nWhen registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your account.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us.\nIf you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy.</p> RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION <p>We store your personal information securely throughout the life of your CB Account.\nWe will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes.\nWhile retention requirements vary by jurisdiction, information about our typical retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal information collected to comply with our legal obligations under financial or anti-money laundering laws may be retained after account closure for as long as required under such laws.</li>\n<li>Contact Information such as your name, email address and telephone number for marketing purposes is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe.\nThereafter we will add your details to our suppression list to ensure we do not inadvertently market to you.</li>\n<li>Content that you post on our website such as support desk comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content may be kept after you close your account for audit and crime prevention purposes (e.g.\nto prevent a known fraudulent actor from opening a new account).</li>\n<li>Recording of our telephone calls with you may be kept for a period of up to six years.</li>\n<li>Information collected via technical means such as cookies, webpage counters and other analytics tools is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.</li>\n</ul> CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION <p>We do not knowingly request to collect personal information from any person under the age of 18.\nIf a user submitting personal information is suspected of being younger than 18 years of age, CB will require the user to close his or her account and will not allow the user to continue using our Services.\nWe will also take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\nPlease notify us if you know of any individuals under the age of 18 using our Services so we can take action to prevent access to our Services.</p> CROSS BORDER TRANSFERS <p>To facilitate our global operations, CB may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies, partners, and service providers based throughout the world, including Ireland, Japan, the UK, the US, the Philippines, and possibly other countries.\nWe contractually obligate recipients of your personal information to agree to at least the same level of privacy safeguards as required under applicable data protection laws.\nBy communicating electronically with CB, you acknowledge and agree to your personal information being processed in this way.</p>\n<p>If you have a complaint about our privacy practices and our collection, use or disclosure of personal information please submit your request via our Support Portal.</p> Data transferred out of the EU <p>We rely primarily on Model Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission to facilitate the international transfer of personal information collected in the EEA, the United Kingdom and Switzerland (\u201cEuropean Personal Information\u201d), and any onward transfer of such information to the extent the recipients of the European Personal Information are located in a country that the EU considers to not provide an adequate level of data protection.\nThis includes transfers from our EU-based CB operating entities to our US-based operating entity, Coinbase, Inc.\nWe may also rely on an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the jurisdiction of the party receiving the information.</p>\n<p>Coinbase, Inc.\nis responsible for the processing of personal Iinformation it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.\nBefore we share your information with any third party, Coinbase, Inc.\nwill enter into a written agreement that the third party provides at least the same level of protection for the personal information as required under applicable data protection laws.\n</p>\n<p>Coinbase, Inc., also participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.\nUnder the Privacy Shield Framework, Coinbase, Inc.\nis subject to the authority of the Federal Trade Commission.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce's Privacy Shield List at https://www.privacyshield.gov.</p>\n<p>European data subjects with inquiries or complaints relating to our Privacy Shield certifications should first contact CB via our Support Portal or by emailing dpo@coinbase.com.\nIf we are unable to resolve your complaint or dispute, you may refer your complaint to our designated independent dispute resolution mechanism, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (\"ICDR\"), operated by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nFor more information and to file a complaint, you may contact the International

https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-ntroduction.</p> YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS <p>Depending on applicable law where you reside, you may be able to assert certain rights related to your personal information identified below.\nIf any of the rights listed below are not provided under law for your operating entity or jurisdiction, CB has absolute discretion in providing you with those rights.</p>\n<p>Your rights to personal information are not absolute.\nDepending upon the applicable law, access may be denied: (a) when denial of access is required or authorized by law.\n(b) when granting access would have a negative impact on another's privacy.\n(c) to protect our rights and properties.\n(d) where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or for other reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Access and portability</strong>.\nYou may request that we provide you a copy of your personal information held by us.\nThis information will be provided without undue delay subject to a potential fee associated with gathering of the information (as permitted by law), unless such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.\nIn certain

closing their account and opening a new account, and to comply with CB's legal obligations.\nHowever, if you close your account, your personal information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Withdraw consent</strong>.\nTo the extent the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time.\nYour withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of

us processing your personal information under certain circumstances.\nWe may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</strong>.\nCB relies on automated tools to help determine whether a transaction or a customer account presents a fraud or legal risk.\nIn some jurisdictions, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information,

help\nus better understand user behavior, and inform us about which parts of our websites people have visited.</p>\n<p>We use first party and third party cookies to recognize you as a\nCoinbase customer, customize Coinbase Services, content, and\nadvertising, to measure promotional effectiveness, and to collect\ninformation about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk,\nhelp prevent fraud, and promote trust and safety.</p>\n<p>We may place cookies from third-party service providers who may use\ninformation about your visits to other websites to target advertisements\nfor products and services available from Coinbase.\nWe do not control the\ntypes of information collected and stored by these third-party cookies.\nYou should check the third-party's website for more information on how\nthey use cookies.</p>\n<p>The following are some examples of information that we\ncollect and how we may use it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect and store details of how you use our Sites and Services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our Services over the Internet, such information will not be associated\nwith your IP address.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect information such as your language, inferred zip code or area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and time zone so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our Services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our websites and platforms, which is used to understand which\nparts of our Sites and Services are of most interest.\nThis data is\naggregated, and thus is considered non-personal information for the\npurposes of this Cookie Policy and our Global Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> WHAT TYPES OF COOKIES DO WE USE? <p>We use the following types of cookies:</p>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies</strong>\n<p>These cookies are necessary for the Sites to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.\nThey are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms.<br>\nThese also include cookies we may rely on for fraud prevention.\nYou can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work.</p>\n<strong>Performance/Analytics Cookies</strong>\n<p>These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can\nmeasure and improve the performance of our Sites.\nThey help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors\nmove around the site.\nAll information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.\nIf you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.</p>\n<strong>Functionality Cookies</strong>\n<p>These cookies allow us to remember the choices you make and to tailor\nour Services so we can provide relevant content to you.\nFor example, a\nfunctionality cookie can remember your preferences (e.g., country or\nlanguage selection), or your username.\n</p>\n<strong>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</strong>\n<p>Coinbase uses third party service providers to display advertising on\nour Services and serve advertising on other third party sites that may be relevant to you or your interests.\nThese cookies are also used to help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.\nThey remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations, such as advertisers.\nThis means that after you have been to our websites, you may see some advertisements about our Services elsewhere on the Internet.\nThe information collected through this process by the third party service providers does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personal information that directly identifies you unless you choose to provide these.\nSuch advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law.\nIf you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less advertising tailored to your inferred interests on our Sites and will not receive targeted Coinbase advertisements on third party websites.</p> HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE? <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on\nwhether it is a \"persistent\" or \"session\" cookie.\nSession cookies will\nonly stay on your device until you close your browser.\nPersistent cookies\nstay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted.</p> WHAT OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES DOES COINBASE USE? <p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies, like web\nbeacons to track users of our Sites and Services.\nWeb beacons, or \"clear gifs,\"\nare tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to\ncookies.\nThey are used to track the online movements of web users.</p>\n<p>In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive\nor device, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about\nthe size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nWe and our\nthird-party service provider employ web beacons for the reasons stated\nabove (under \"Cookies\"), but primarily to help us

and store information about your use of\nour services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.</p> HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES, SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND TARGETED ONLINE MOBILE ADVERTISING <p>You

or financial crime agencies and that these agencies may respond to our enquiries in full.\nThis is an identity check only and should have no adverse effect on your credit rating.\nAdditionally, we may require you to wait some amount of time after completion of a transaction before permitting you to use further Coinbase Services and/or before permitting you to engage in transactions beyond certain volume limits.</em>\n</i>\n</p> 4.\nE-MONEY SERVICES.\n<p>4.1 <strong>Loading.</strong> You can load funds into your E-Money Wallet using bank transfer (or other payment methods available on the Site for your location), and your E-Money Wallet will show loaded funds once we have received them.\nLoading of funds may be done manually, or as part of a recurring transaction that you set up on your Coinbase Account (see <strong>Section 5.12</strong> below for more details).\nYou may only load your own funds, from your own account, and not from any joint, pooled or third party account.\nWhen funds are loaded into the E-Money Wallet you will be issued with E-Money by Coinbase Ireland that represents the funds you have loaded.\nThe E-Money Wallet is not a deposit or investment account which means that your E-Money will not be protected by the Deposit Guarantee Scheme or the Investor Compensation Scheme.\nCoinbase Ireland will only hold funds received from users in a designated safekeeping account with a regulated financial institution.\nE-Money held in an E-Money Wallet will not earn any interest.\nYour E-Money Wallet may hold E-Money denominated in different currencies and we will show the E-Money balance for each currency that you hold.</p>\n<p>4.2 <strong>Purchase or Sale of Digital Currency.</strong> You may purchase supported Digital Currency by using E-Money credited to your E-Money Wallet.\nTo carry out a Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money, you must follow the relevant instructions on the Site.\nA Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money should normally be settled no later than one business day after we receive your instructions.\nYou authorise us to debit E-Money from your E-Money Wallet.\nAlthough we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, E-Money may be debited from your E-Money Wallet before Digital Currency is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\n<p>You may sell Digital Currency in exchange for E-Money.\nYou authorise us to debit your Digital Currency Wallet and credit your E-Money Wallet with the relevant amount of E-Money.\n</p>\n<p>4.3 <strong>Receipt of Instructions.</strong> If we receive instructions from you to purchase Digital Currency using E-Money on a non-business day or after 4:30 pm (Dublin time) on a business day, we may treat those instructions as if they were received by us on the following business day.\n</p>\n<p>4.4 <strong>Revocation.</strong> When you give us instructions to carry out a Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money, you cannot withdraw your consent to that Digital Currency Transaction unless the Digital Currency Transaction is not due to occur until an agreed date in the future e.g.\nif you have set up Future Transactions (see <strong>Section 5.11</strong> below for more details).\nIn the case of a Future Transaction, you may withdraw your consent up until the end of the business day before the date that the Future Transaction is due to take place.\nTo withdraw your consent to a Future Transaction, follow the instructions on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>4.5 <strong>Unsuccessful Payments.</strong> If a payment to load funds into your E-Money Wallet is not successful, you authorise Coinbase, in its sole discretion, either to cancel any related Digital Currency Transactions or to debit your other payment methods, including Coinbase balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the Digital Currency Transactions in question.\nYou are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.\n</p>\n<p>4.6 <strong>Account Information.</strong> You will be able to see your E-Money Wallet balance and your transaction history using the Site, including (i) the amount (and currency) of each Digital Currency Purchase, (ii) a reference to identify the payer and / or payee (as appropriate), (iii) any fees charged (including a breakdown of the fees), (iv) where there has been a currency exchange, the rate of exchange, and the amount (in the new currency) after exchange (where you are the payer) or the amount (in the original currency) before the exchange (where you are the payee), and (v) the debit or credit date of each Digital Currency Purchase (as appropriate).</p>\n<p>4.7 <strong>Redeeming E-Money.</strong> You may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your E-Money Wallet at any time by selecting the relevant option in the Site and following the instructions.\nUnless agreed otherwise, funds will be transferred to the bank account you have registered with us.\nIf this Agreement is terminated, we will redeem any E-Money remaining in your E-Money Wallet and attempt to transfer funds to the bank account you have registered with us.\nPrior to redeeming E-Money from your E-Money Wallet, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes, and as required by applicable law.\nThis may mean you are prevented or delayed from withdrawing E-Money until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our regulatory requirements.\n</p>\n<p>4.8 <strong>Unauthorised and Incorrect Transactions.</strong> Where a purchase of Digital Currency and / or redemption of E-Money is initiated from your E-Money Wallet using your credentials, we will assume that you authorised such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise.</p>\n<p>If you believe that a transaction using your E-Money Wallet has been carried out that you did not authorise (an \u201c<strong>Unauthorised Transaction</strong>\u201d), or if you have reason to believe that a transaction using your E-Money Wallet has been incorrectly carried out or is not complete (an \u201c<strong>Incorrect Transaction</strong>\u201d), you must contact us as soon as possible, and in any case no later than 13 months after the Unauthorised Transaction or Incorrect Transaction occurred.\n</p>\n<p>It is important that you regularly check your E-Money Wallet balance and your transaction history to ensure any Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>\n<p>We are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this <strong>Section 4.8</strong>, in which case <strong>Section 4.9</strong> below sets out our respective responsibilities.\nAs further described in <strong>Section 4.9</strong> below, we are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions if you have acted fraudulently, intentionally or with gross negligence and this has resulted in the Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions.</p>\n<p>During any investigation of any actual or potential Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions, we reserve the right to suspend your Coinbase Account to avoid further losses.</p>\n<p>4.9 <strong>Refund Rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(A) <strong>Unauthorised Transactions - E-Money Wallet.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If an Unauthorised Transaction occurs in your E-Money Wallet as a result of our failure, we will refund you the amount of that transaction by no later than the end of the next business day after becoming aware of the Unauthorised Transaction and restore your E-Money Wallet to the state it would have been in had the Unauthorised Transaction not taken place.\nGenerally, you will not be liable for losses incurred after you have notified us of the Unauthorised Transaction or if we have failed at any time to provide you with the means for notifying us.\n</p>\n<p>You will be liable for the first EUR 50 of any losses you incur in respect of an Unauthorised Transaction in your E-Money Wallet which arises from the use of lost or stolen credentials (for example when you have failed to keep the login details for your Coinbase Account secure), and if you are fraudulent, or you intentionally or negligently fail to carry out your obligations under this Agreement and this results in Unauthorised Transactions in your E-Money Wallet (for example, if you deliberately share your email and password with a third party, or are grossly negligent in keeping your email and password secure, in both cases other than in accordance with Sections 3.2 and/or 4.10), you will be liable for all resultant losses incurred as a result of any such Unauthorised Transactions, not just the first EUR 50.\n</p>\n<p>Where there is a dispute between us and you regarding whether or not a transaction is an Unauthorised Transaction, we may (but are not obliged to) temporarily credit your E-Money Wallet whilst we settle the dispute.\nWhere we determine that the transaction was authorised, we may reverse that credit and correct errors made in any statement of E-Money Wallet without prior notice to you, although please note that during this period your E-Money Wallet may be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorised Transactions.\nYou will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any E-Money you have transferred which was temporarily credited to your E-Money Wallet.</p>\n<p>(B) <strong>Incorrect Transactions - E-Money Wallet.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where an Incorrect Transaction is made in your E-Money Wallet as a result of our action or error we shall refund to you the amount of that transaction without undue delay and restore your E-Money Wallet to the state in which it would have been had the Incorrect Transaction not taken place.\nWe will also endeavour to provide you with reasonable notice where possible.\nWe will also pay any charges for which we are responsible, and for any interest which you can show that you have had to pay as a consequence of any Incorrect Transaction.\nIrrespective of our liability, on your request, we shall try to trace any Incorrect Transaction initiated by you free of charge.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to trace such transactions.</p>\n<p>4.10 <strong>Appointment of Regulated Third Parties.</strong> You may, as set out in <strong>Section 3.2</strong>, appoint appropriately regulated third parties to access your E-Money Wallet (\u201c<strong>Regulated Third Parties</strong>\u201d).\nIf you do so, you should be aware that by virtue of such access, that Regulated Third Party may access your transactional and other data, and / or may initiate transfers from your E-Money Wallet.\n<u>You will be liable for any actions that any Regulated Third Parties take on your Coinbase Account, as further set out in <strong>Section 3.2</strong> above.\nWe reserve the right to refuse access to any Regulated Third Parties, as set out in <strong>Section 4.11</strong> below.</u>\n</p>\n<p>4.11 <strong>Refusing to deal with Regulated Third Parties.</strong> We may refuse access to Regulated Third Parties for objectively justified and duly evidenced reasons relating to unauthorised or fraudulent access to your E-Money Wallet, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime, and as required by applicable law.\nIn such cases, unless we are prohibited by applicable law, we will inform you that that Regulated Third Party's access has been denied and the reasons why.\nWe will permit access again once we are satisfied that the reasons for refusing access no longer exist.\n</p>\n<p>4.12 <strong>Consent.</strong> By opening a Coinbase Account with us you provide your explicit consent to us providing E-Money Services to you.\nYou can withdraw this consent at any time by closing your Coinbase Account.\n</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this consent does not relate to our processing of your personal information or your rights under and in accordance with data protection law and regulations.\nPlease see <strong>Section 11</strong> (<i>Data Protection</i>) below and our Privacy Policy for information about how we process your personal data, and the rights you have in respect of this.</p>\n<p>4.13 <strong>Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.</strong> If you have a complaint relating to the E-Money Services provided to you by Coinbase Ireland, and that complaint cannot be resolved through the dispute process set out in <strong>Section 10.3</strong>, you may then be able to take unresolved complaints to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (\"<strong>FSPO</strong>\").\nYou agree that you will not raise a complaint with the FSPO until the dispute process set out in <strong>Section 10.3</strong> has been completed.\nYou can find further information about the FSPO and the types of complainants eligible to submit matters to the FSPO using the following details:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Address:</strong>

</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Website:</strong> https://www.fspo.ie/</p> 5.\nDIGITAL CURRENCY SERVICES.\n<p>5.1 <strong>In General.</strong> Your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Digital Currency from, other users or third parties outside the Coinbase Platform, by giving instructions through the Site (each such transaction is a \"<strong>Digital Currency Transaction</strong>\").</p>\n<p>The Digital Currency exchange service enables you to buy Digital Currency on the Coinbase Platform using:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(A) E-Money from your E-Money Wallet;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(B) Central bank issued currency (such as EUR or GBP) supported by Coinbase.\nand/or</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(C) Other types of Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\n<p>Conversely, when you sell Digital Currency on the Coinbase Platform, you may elect to receive:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(D) E-Money into your E-Money Wallet;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(E) Central bank issued currency (such as EUR or GBP) supported by Coinbase.\nand/or</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n(F) Other types of Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet.</p>\n<p>Coinbase facilitates and enables the purchase and sale of Digital Currency between its customers on the Coinbase Platform.</p>\n<p>5.2 <strong>Fiat Currency Transactions (not using your E-Money Wallet)</strong> You may purchase supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method to your Digital Currency Wallet.\nYou authorise us to debit funds using your selected payment method(s) to complete your purchase.</p>\n<p>Although we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your selected payment method before the status of your Digital Currency Transaction is shown as complete, and the Digital Currency is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet.\nYou may sell Digital Currency in exchange for fiat currency (such as EUR or GBP) supported by Coinbase.\nIn such circumstances, you authorise us to debit your Digital Currency Wallet and to send instructions to credit your selected payment method(s) in settlement of sell transactions.\nWe will send these instructions as soon as reasonably possible.\nAny fiat currency should be credited to your selected payment method(s) by the end of the business day after we send such instructions.\n</p>\n<p>5.3 <strong>Transaction Fulfilment.</strong> We will make reasonable efforts to fulfil all purchases of Digital Currency, but in some circumstances, we may be unable to.\nIf this is the case, we will notify you and seek your approval to re-attempt the purchase at the current Exchange Rate (as defined below).\n</p>\n<p>5.4 <strong>Availability of Payment Methods.</strong> The availability of a method of payment depends on a number of factors including, for example, where you are located, the identification information you have provided to us, and limitations imposed by third party payment processors.</p>\n<p>5.5 <strong>Conversion Fees.</strong> Each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is subject to a fee (a \"<strong>Conversion Fee</strong>\").\nThe applicable Conversion Fee will be displayed to you on the Site prior to each transaction and is stated in each receipt we issue to you.\nWe may adjust our Conversion Fees at any time.\nWe will not process a transaction if the Conversion Fee and any other associated fees would, together, exceed the value of your transaction.\nA full list of Coinbase Europe's fees can be found on our Pricing and Fees Disclosures page.</p>\n<p>5.6 <strong>Exchange Rates.</strong> Each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is also subject to the Exchange Rate for the given transaction.\nThe \"Exchange Rate\" means the price of a given supported Digital Currency in fiat currency as quoted on the Site.\nThe Exchange Rate is stated either as a \"Buy Price\" or as a \"Sell Price\", which is the price at which you may buy or sell Digital Currency, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the Buy Price Exchange Rate may not be the same as the Sell Price Exchange Rate at any given time, and that we may add a margin or \u2018spread\u2019 to the quoted Exchange Rate.\nYou agree to accept the Exchange Rate when you authorise a transaction.\nYou can learn more about Coinbase Europe's Exchange Rates on our \u2018Pricing and Fees Disclosures\u2019 page on the Site.\nWe do not guarantee the availability of any Exchange Rate.\nWe do not guarantee that you will be able to buy and / or sell your Digital Currency on the open market at any particular price or time.\n</p>\n<p>5.7 <strong>Authorisations.\nReversals.\nCancellations.</strong> By clicking the \u2018Buy\u2019 or \u2018Sell\u2019 button on the Site, you are authorising Coinbase to initiate the transaction at the quoted Buy Price or Sell Price and agree to any associated Conversion Fees and Exchange Fees and any other fees.</p>\n<p>You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending.\nIf your payment is not successful or if your payment method has insufficient funds, you authorise us, in our sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including balances on your E-Money Wallet and/or Digital Currency Wallets, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction.\nYou are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.\nCoinbase reserves the right to suspend access to Coinbase Services (including Coinbase Consumer, Coinbase Pro) until such insufficient payment is addressed.</p>\n<p>5.8 <strong>Digital Currency Transactions.</strong> We will process Digital Currency Transactions in accordance with the instructions we receive from you.\nYou should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us.\nWe do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other third party and we will have no liability or responsibility for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate and complete.\n</p>\n<p>Digital Currency Transactions cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network.\nIf you initiate a Digital Currency Transaction by entering the recipient's email address and the recipient does not have an existing Coinbase Account, we will invite the recipient to open a Coinbase Account.\nIf the recipient does not open a Coinbase Account within 30 days, we will return the relevant Digital Currency to your Digital Currency Wallet.\n</p>\n<p>We may charge network fees (\u201c<strong>miner fees</strong>\u201d) to process a Digital Currency Transaction on your behalf.\nWe will calculate the miner fees at our discretion, although we will always notify you of the miner fees at (or before) the time you authorise the Digital Currency Transaction.\nA full list of Coinbase Europe's miner fees can be found on our \u2018Pricing and Fees Disclosures\u2019 page on the Site.\nMiner fees for each individual transaction will be disclosed to you at the time of purchase on the checkout page.\nWhen you or a third party sends Digital Currency to a Coinbase Digital Currency Wallet from an external wallet not hosted on Coinbase, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of miner fees in order for the transaction to be completed successfully.\nNon-payment of miner fees may cause your transaction to remain in a pending state outside of Coinbase Europe\u2019s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.</p>\n<p>Once submitted to a Digital Currency network, a Digital Currency Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network.\nA Digital Currency Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state.\nDigital Currency associated with Digital Currency Transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly and will not be included in your Digital Currency Wallet balance or be available to conduct Digital Currency Transactions until confirmed by the network.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We may also refuse to process or cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required by law, regulation or any court or other authority to which Coinbase is subject in any jurisdiction, for instance, if there is suspicion of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.9 <strong>Supported Digital Currencies.</strong> Our Digital Currency Services are available only in connection with those digital currencies that Coinbase supports (\u201c<strong>Supported Digital Currencies</strong>\u201d), and this may change from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies in any form that we do not support.\nWe assume no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet for digital currencies that we do not support.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Coinbase bears no responsibility and is not liable for any unsupported asset that is sent to a wallet associated with your Coinbase Account.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about which Digital Currencies we currently support, please visit <strong>https://help.coinbase.com.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.10 <strong>Ending support of a Digital Currency.</strong> Coinbase may in its sole discretion terminate support for any Digital Currency.\nCoinbase will provide you no less than 10 days notice (unless a shorter period is required by applicable law or a regulatory authority) via email to the email address associated with your Coinbase account to announce the end of such support.\nIf you do not sell or send such Digital Currency off platform during this time, Coinbase reserves the right to withdraw such Digital Currencies from your account and credit your Coinbase account with the market value of a supported Digital Currency or a fiat currency (which denomination will be selected in our reasonable discretion).</p>\n<p>5.11 <strong>USDC Wallets.</strong> Where available, you may also elect to buy USD Coin through Coinbase, a Digital Currency fully collateralized by the US Dollar, which is issued by Circle Internet Financial (\u201c<strong>Circle</strong>\u201d) and supported by Coinbase (\u201c<strong>USDC</strong>\u201d).\nYou are the owner of the balance of your \u201c<strong>USDC Wallet</strong>\u201d (i.e.\nthe Digital Currency Wallet provided to you by Coinbase Europe to hold USDC and through which Digital Currency Transactions in USDC can be carried out).\nCoinbase is not the issuer of USDC, does not hold U.S.\nDollars (\u201c<strong>USD</strong>\u201d) on reserve for USDC holders, and has no obligation to repurchase your USDC for USD.\nYou can redeem your USDC with Circle, and Coinbase may also elect to repurchase your USDC in exchange for USD.\nYou agree to be bound by the terms of the Circle USDC Agreement (located at https://support.usdc.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001233386-Circle-USDC-User-Agreement), which provides additional obligations, undertakings, and limitations with respect to USDC.</p>\n<p>5.12 <strong>Recurring Digital Currency Transactions.</strong> If you set up a recurring purchase of Digital Currency (a \"<strong>Future Transaction</strong>\"), you authorise us to initiate recurring electronic payments in accordance with your selected Digital Currency Transaction and any corresponding payment accounts, such as direct debits from, or credits to, your linked bank account.\nYour Future Transactions will occur in identical, periodic instalments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or Coinbase cancels the Future Transaction.\n</p>\n<p>If you select a bank account as your payment method for a Future Transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or public holiday in the location in which the relevant bank is located, or after the relevant bank\u2019s business hours, the credit or debit will be executed on the next business day, although the Digital Currency fees at the time of the regularly-scheduled transaction will apply.\nIf your bank is unable to process any payment to Coinbase, we will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may avail ourselves of remedies set forth in this Agreement to recover any amount owed to Coinbase.\nThis authorisation will remain in full force and effect until you change your Future Transaction settings or until you provide us with written notice via https://help.coinbase.com.\nYou agree to notify Coinbase in writing of any changes in your linked bank account information prior to a Future Transaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Coinbase may, at any time, terminate Future Transactions by providing notice to you.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.13 <strong>Supplemental Protocols Excluded.</strong> Unless specifically announced on the Site or via an official public statement of Coinbase, Supported Digital Currencies excludes all other protocols and/or functionality which supplement or interact with the

functionality, such as staking, protocol governance, and/or any smart contract functionality, which may supplement or interact with a Supported Digital Currency (collectively, \u201c<strong>Supplemental Protocols</strong>\u201d).\nDo not use your Coinbase Account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction or functionality involving any such Supplemental Protocols, as the Coinbase Platform is not configured to detect, secure, or process these transactions and functionalities.\nAny attempted transactions in such items will result in loss of the item.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You acknowledge and agree that Supplemental Protocols are excluded from Supported Digital Currency and that Coinbase has no liability for any losses related to Supplemental Protocols.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>5.14 <strong>Operation of Digital Currency Protocols.</strong> We do not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our platform.\nGenerally, the underlying protocols are \u2018open source\u2019 and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and we are not able to guarantee the functionality or security of network operations.\nYou acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software protocols relating to any Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet may change.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In particular, the underlying protocols are likely to be subject to sudden changes in operating rules (including \u201c<strong>forks</strong>\u201d).\nAny such material operating changes may materially affect the availability, value, functionality, and/or the name of the Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet.\nCoinbase does not control the timing and features of these material operating changes.\nIt is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes and you must carefully consider publicly available information and information that may be provided by Coinbase

without notice to Coinbase.\nCoinbase\u2019s response to any material operating change is subject to its sole discretion and includes deciding not to support any new digital currency, fork, or other actions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You acknowledge and accept the risks of operating changes to Digital Currency protocols and agree that Coinbase is not responsible for such operating changes and not liable for any loss of value you may experience as a result of such changes in operating rules.\nYou acknowledge and accept that Coinbase has sole discretion to determine its response to any operating change

you may purchase or receive from, or sell or transfer to, any third party (including other users of the Digital Currency Services).\nWe are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so.\nIf you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, any third party using Digital Currency transferred using the Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.</p>\n<p>If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Coinbase Support at: trust@coinbase.com so that we may consider what action to take, if any.</p>\n<p>5.17 <strong>Coinbase Vaults.</strong> Coinbase does not support the use of multisig vaults.\nYou may elect to use other services, such as the
