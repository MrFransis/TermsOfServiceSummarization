read on for more details!</p> What information EthicalAds collects and why\nInformation from website browsers\n<p>If you're <strong>just browsing our website</strong> or just browsing a site running ads from our ad network, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect.\nWe use common internet technologies, such as web server logs.\nWe collect this basic information from everybody, whether they have an account or not.</p>\n<p>The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the visitor's browser type</li>\n<li>language preference</li>\n<li>referring site</li>\n<li>the date and time of each visitor request</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use EthicalAds, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.</p>\n<p>We analyze potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses although we generally do not store this information.\nIt is used in real-time for geo-targeting advertising and fraud prevention.\nLogs containing IP addresses are deleted after no more than 10 days.</p>\nInformation from users with accounts\n<p>If you <strong>create an account</strong> as publishers who display our ads or advertisers buying ads do, we require some basic information at the time of account creation.\nYou will create your own password, and we will ask you for a valid email account.\nYou also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\"</p>\n<p>\"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her.\nInformation such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of \"User Personal Information.\"</p>\n<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information.\nWe may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p> What information EthicalAds does not collect\n<p>We do not intentionally collect <strong>sensitive personal information</strong>, such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical

person's sex life or sexual orientation.\nIf you choose to store any Sensitive Personal Information on our servers, you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that
