<strong>MediaFire\u2019s Privacy Policy and User Notice</strong>\n<p>\n</p> Introduction\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>MediaFire recognizes and believes that data privacy is essential to all Internet users, and the privacy of your personal information is of the utmost importance to us.\nWe are committed to providing you an experience that is safe, secure, and trustworthy.\nPart of this commitment means safeguarding and respecting your privacy and your choices.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice explains what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it, in addition to information on disclosure, retention, and protection of your personal information.</p>\n<p>Because we\u2019re a technology company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we\u2019ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.\nThis Privacy Policy gives you an overview of all possible situations in which we could interact together.\nOf course, all situations may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy, in conjunction with our Terms of Service, collectively referred to as the \"Agreement\", governs your use of the MediaFire website, Content, apps, software, products, applications, tools and services provided to you on, from, or through the MediaFire website or platform regardless of how your access or use them (collectively, the \"Services\").\nWhere we provide the Services under contract with an organization (for example your employer) that organization controls the information processed by the Services.\n\u201cUser\u201d, \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cYour\u201d refers to you, the person accessing this website and accepting MediaFire\u2019s Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.\n\u201cWe\u201d, \u201cUs\u201d, and \u201cOurselves\u201d refers to MediaFire.\n\u201cParty\u201d, \u201cParties\u201d, or \u201cUs\u201d, refers to both you and ourselves.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if the words are capitalized or not.\nIf you choose not to accept this Policy, please do not access or use our Services or interact with any other aspect of our business.</p>\n<p>All topics are covered in greater detail below.</p> Overview\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We want you to fully understand how we may collect, use, and share data relating to you, our legal basis, your rights and the choices that are available to you.</p> This Privacy Policy incorporates:\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better navigation and user-friendly language.\nTo make the policy easier to understand, we use clear, plain language and examples that illustrate our activities.</li>\n<li>Insights into how we acquire your information and how it is used.</li>\n<li>More control over your information.\nWe provide intelligence on how you can control the information you provide to us.\nOur policy explains how you can make choices about your information, and the measures we\u2019ve put in place to keep your information secure.</li>\n<li>More about using our products for work.\nMany users have access to our services through their organizations (e.g., their employers), who control their accounts or use of our Services.\nThe updated policy clarifies our relationship to these users and explains the tools available to administrators of these users.</li>\n</ul> What is Personal and Non Personal Information?\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Personally Identifiable Information, commonly referred to as PII, is information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an online or device identifier, an identification number, or location data such as your IP address.\nIn relation to your interaction with MediaFire, personal information, for example, may include information you may purposefully provide such as your name and email address during account registration or your address and financial information if you make a purchase.\nBy visiting our website, we automatically collect your IP address.\nUpon your request and in order for us to download or distribute any Content uploaded by you to MediaFire, your files become published Content and cannot be considered personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>Non-personally identifiable information cannot be used to identify or locate an individual person.\nExamples are: hashed/anonymized/pseudonymized data, click stream information, browser type, demographics, time and date, which advertisements are clicked or scrolled over and other data of interest.</p>\n<p>We will not share personal information about you or any of your Content with any third parties except as described in this Privacy Notice.</p> Who We Get Information From and How Your Information Is Used\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Whenever you use any website, mobile application or other internet service, certain information gets created and logged automatically.\nThe same is true when you visit MediaFire.</p>\n<p>We use your personal information to fulfill our commitment to you and provide you with our Services.\nIn short, it\u2019s necessary for us to do these things in order to make our Services relevant, interesting and personal to you.\nWe balance our interests with your rights.</p>\n<p>How we use the information we collect depends in part on which Services you use, how you use them, and any choices you have made about information you provide.</p>\n<p>Below are the specific purposes for which we use the information we collect from and about you.</p>\n<p>You give us information yourself voluntarily, when you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create and update an account <p>In order to use certain features, you need to create an account with us.\nWe ask for the bare minimum amount of necessary information - your name and email address, a user ID selected by you, and a, hopefully, complicated and very secure password.\nThen we assign you a unique identifying number in our database.</p>\n<p>We use this information to authenticate you when you log in and to communicate with you.\nCommunications may be to onboard you to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.\nOr, to send you administrative messages and information, notifications about changes to our Services, and updates to our agreements.\nAdditionally, communications could be about Service features, updates, security alerts, technical notices, support and administrative messages, surveys, offers, promotions, events, and provide other news or information which may interest you or other similar messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Make a purchase <p>If you purchase a subscription or add-ons, you must provide certain payment and billing data to our payment processing partners, including your name, credit card information, billing address, and zip code.\nWe do store purchase history, billing, and payment confirmation information.\nWe\u2019ll email you invoices confirming your purchase</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Contact us directly <p>If you contact us for support or to report a problem or concern (regardless of whether you have created an account), we collect and store your messages, and other data about you like your name, email address, location, operating system, IP address, and any other data you provide or that we collect through automated means (which we cover below).\nWe use this data to respond to you and research your question or concern.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Interact with our ads <p>Our advertisers gather information when you click on or tap ads or watch videos.</p>\n<p>The information is used to show you content that\u2019s relevant, interesting and personal to you and to tailor advertisements across your various devices.\nStudying ad results helps us make decisions about our customers advertising preferences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Add names and email addresses to share folders and files <p>To use these features, you provide names and email addresses in order to enable the functionality of the features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Add people or designate an administrator or billing representative for a business account <p>Companies purchase seats on their account for employees or business associates and provide names and email addresses for the person \u2018occupying\u2019 each seat purchased.\nBy necessity, each business account will need to provide contact information for their account administrator and, if different, a billing representative.\nIf you are an individual registered user and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by your employer and was assigned to you as an employee of that organization, and your organization wishes to establish a business account, then certain information concerning past use of your individual account may become accessible to that organization\u2019s administrator or group of users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Share your information from other companies, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google <p>You may allow transmission of your personal information from companies like these, which may be controlled in the settings of each website, not by MediaFire.\nMediaFire does not ask for information about you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Provide information at an event we sponsor or participate in <p>Your name, contact, and possibly other information, may be recorded on our servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Your administrator integrates our Services with other services you use <p>To do this, you will need an account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>File a DMCA claim with us <p>When you file a DMCA claim, you provide information about who you are.\nAll the info will be kept on our servers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy <p>You must accept our agreements in order to use our Services and we record your clicked acceptance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Apply for a job <p>When a person applies for a job with MediaFire thru our website, all information is recorded and maintained on our servers.\nApplications received in person or by mail will be manually processed and your name and contact information will be entered into forms stored on our servers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our systems and/or third parties may automatically obtain information:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Third-party platforms you connect with <p>An example would be logging into MediaFire from Facebook.\nWe need to ensure it\u2019s you, so information is passed to us.\nYou should review the privacy policies of every website you visit.\nWebsites use cookies to track users and gather information.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Information about your device(s) <p>Information about your IP address, device make, model, operating system, version, and data connection type, and platform, in addition to other specifications and information will be automatically gleaned during contact with our Services.\n</p>\n<p>We may send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to provide updates and other relevant messages related to our Services.\nThese may include information and in-app messages about, new services, new features, etc.</p>\n<p>Devices are discussed in more detail below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When you upload, download, collaborate, share files or otherwise interact with our Services <p>These actions also are subject to the next point below \u2013 \u2018When you interact with our website or mobile app or API\u2019.</p>\n<p>You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission for others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your company administrator (if applicable) select.\nSome of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.\nUnder certain circumstances, when you share a file, your display name and profile picture may be displayed on that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.\nYou can confirm whether certain information is visible from within the Services by contacting us or your administrator (if applicable).\nPlease be aware that any Content posted, including information about you, by you or anyone with access to the Content, that Content may be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When you interact with our website or mobile app or API <p>MediaFire is always looking for ways to make our Services smarter and faster, and more innovative and useful to you.\nWe use collective learnings about how people use our Services so we may identify areas for integration and improvement, and feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot our Services.</p>\n<p>To that end, when you interact with us, or really any technology service today, information is gathered to help us fulfill our commitments to you to provide and protect our Services and you.\nTo do that, we need:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Information about your behavior on MediaFire:</b> including, login details, date/time of visits, page view data, URL of the Web page you visited before navigating to us, referring/exit pages, click data, features you use, types of advertisements you interact with, duration of your visit, the sizes and names of the files or folders you upload, download, share or access.</p>\n<p>We use this information to personalize and improve our Services, by analyzing who we appeal to, activity patterns and trends, develop new products and services, and test and analyze new features by providing features to some users before rolling the feature out to all users.\nFor example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature, we can understand which version is better.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Information about your devices</b> plus your browser information, browser history, IP address, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) you use, your geolocation and system configuration information is recorded.\n</p>\n<p>This information can help us identify unique users across multiple devices so we can monitor and analyze traffic and trends and track usage and activities in connection with our Services.\nWe use general location information to provide country based advertising (e.g.\nUS-based advertising, if you are in the US).\nWe also perform studies necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our site and mobile applications, monitor and improve the information security, and to facilitate the Services\u2019 technical functioning, including troubleshooting and resolving issues.</p>\n<p>Information may be used as required or permitted by law, or as we, in our sole discretion, otherwise determine to be necessary to ensure the safety and integrity of our users, employees, third parties, the public, or our Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other companies give us data:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> We may collect info from third party services we contract with <p>We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing and fraud detection, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.\nWe select only well-established and trusted service partners to access information about you to perform services on our behalf.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Information related to your use of third-party services <p>The information we receive when you link or integrate our Services with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service.\nYou should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with our Services.</p>\n<p>Have you ever searched for information on a mailbox and then when you visit other websites you see ads for mailboxes? We contract with advertising companies that will use your previous search history and clicks to provide advertising of specific interest to you.\nYour interests and interactions with ads are not stored on our servers, but we do benefit from this practice.\nAfter all, ads help support our website and the experience should be of interest to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>When you engage in an online survey initiated by us <p>From time to time, we may perform research (online and offline) via surveys.\nWe may engage third-party service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf.\nAll survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us better serve our users, as a whole, by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide.\nThe survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Website, various types of communications and/or promotional activities, and innovations in products and other service offerings we might contemplate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>From a social media website <p>We allow you to use social media sites to create your MediaFire account, sign in to us, or to connect your account with the social media site.\nSocial media sites may give us automatic access to certain personal information retained by them about you (e.g., content viewed by you, content liked by you, and information about the advertisements you have been shown or have clicked on, etc.).</p>\n<p>To sign in from a social media website, such as Facebook or Twitter, information is shared between us to authenticate your identity.\nThose platforms and services make information available to us through their APIs.\nThe information we receive depends on what information you or the platform or service decide to give us.\nThe information we get from those services depends on your settings and their privacy policies, so please check what those are.</p>\n<p>If you click on a link provided via a social media plugin, you are voluntarily establishing a connection with that respective social media site.\nServices, like Facebook, give you the option to post information from your account with them.\nThe social media features on our website, like the Facebook Like Button, may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things, such as, your IP address and which page of our Services you\u2019re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature (e.g.\nLike Button).\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the social media\u2019s own privacy policy.</p>\n<p>You should be aware that any information you provide on social media websites, community forums and publicly accessible blogs, including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information, may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.\nYour posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account.\nWe urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Device Information\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We automatically receive certain types of information when you install, access, update, or use our Services.\nThis information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's unique identifier, manufacturer and model, operating system and version, screen size and resolution, mobile network and status (WiFi, etc.), application version including installation and updates info, settings, and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks.\nWhether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you\u2019re using and its settings.\nFor example, different types of information are available depending on whether you\u2019re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone.\nTo learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.\n</p>\n<p>We use this information to determine what types and version of devices, etc.\nare accessing our Services.\nAfter all, we have to write software to accommodate various platforms, versions, etc.\nWe have to keep up and necessarily sunset unused code.\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of the MediaFire Services, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage and disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.\nInformation may be collected from you in various ways when you use our Services.\nWe automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, apps, services and communications.\nThis information includes your computer, tablet, mobile or other digital device's IP address, access times, your browser type and language.\nWe may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and accessed pages.\nPersonal and non-personally identifiable information from collected data may be shared with third parties who work on our behalf to provide your services.\nThese third-party services and unique identifiers may be used to contact you, measure usage and analyze trends, administer the website and collect information for its databases.\nFor example: Google Analytics Privacy Policy.</p> Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>What are they?</p>\n<p>When you interact with people, it\u2019s nice when they remember you, your relationship and what you like.\nThat \u2018feel good\u2019 experience has been extended to your interactions with websites.</p>\n<p>Like most browsers and websites, we use technologies that are essentially small data files saved on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices that allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our site, Services, applications, messaging, and tools, and to recognize you across devices.</p>\n<p>MediaFire and service providers acting on our behalf (like Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints, and web beacons when you access and use our Services.\nThese tools are essential to enable the Services to provide the features you have requested, such as remembering you have logged in.\nThese tools also automatically track and collect certain system data and usage data when you use our Services.\nIn some cases, we tie data gathered through these tools to other data that we collect.</p>\n<p>These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device.\nThe specific names and types of cookies, web beacons, unique identifiers, and similar technologies used to collect and manage information may change from time to time.\nIn order to help you better understand our use of such technologies, we have provided the some terminology and definitions.</p>\n<p>Cookies are mutually beneficial small text files, which often include a unique identifier, placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message.\nThey are commonly used to remember where you were during your session with a website.\nThey can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites.\nCookies allow us to recognize you, remember things about your visits, make our site easier to use, see which areas and features are popular and count visits to our website.\nMost web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.\nThere are several types of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow sites to link your actions during that particular browser session.\nThey help with navigation on a website and are enabled by default.\n</li>\n<li>Persistent cookies are stored on your device and record information, allowing sites to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites.\nThey remain until you manually delete them or until they expire.\n</li>\n<li>First-party cookies are created by the website you are visiting and are necessary to keep track of your personal preferences and the current session.\nMost web browsers enable first-party cookies by default.\nIf you were to disable first-party cookies, a website could not keep track of your activity as you move from page to page.\n</li>\n<li>Third-party cookies are set by a third party site separate from the site you are visiting.\nThese are commonly used for advertising, analytics, etc.\n</li>\n<li>Flash cookies aka Local Shared Objects (\u201cLSO\u201d) are a small file stored on your computer by a website that uses Adobe\u2019s Flash player technology.\nInformation stored on a Flash cookie is available to all browsers and is considered a security issue.\nWhen you delete or clear cookies from your browser, you will not necessarily delete the Flash cookies stored on your computer.\nMediaFire does not use Flash cookies.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web beacons are small graphic images (also known as \"pixel tags\" or \"clear GIFs\") that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behavior.\nThere are myriad ways in which they can be used.\nFor example, a third-party tracking site can determine how much merchandise was purchased for a particular banner ad campaign.\nIn scenarios such as these, the individual users may still remain anonymous, even though their buying habits are disclosed.</p>\n<p>Mobile device identifiers - When you access mobile applications, companies don\u2019t have access to traditional browser cookies to track you over time.\nInstead, third party advertising and analytics companies use device identifiers, such as Apple iOS\u2019s Identifiers for Advertisers and Google Android\u2019s Advertising ID, to monitor the different applications used on a particular device.</p>\n<p>Device fingerprinting can track devices over time, based on your browser\u2019s configurations and settings.\nBecause each browser is unique, device fingerprinting can identify your device, without using cookies.\nSince device fingerprinting uses the characteristics of your browser configuration to track you, deleting cookies won\u2019t help.\nDevice fingerprinting technologies are evolving and can be used to track you on all kinds of internet-connected devices that have browsers, such as smart phones, tablets, laptop and desktop computers.\n</p>\n<p>HTML5 has been designed to deliver almost everything you'd want to do online without requiring additional software such as browser plugins.\nIt does everything from animation to apps, music to movies, and can also be used to build incredibly complicated applications that run in your browser.\nAnd, it can generally be used as an alternative to Adobe Flash.\nIt isn't proprietary and it is cross-platform, which means it doesn't care whether you're using a tablet or a smartphone, a netbook, notebook or ultrabook or a Smart TV.\nIf your browser supports HTML5, it should work flawlessly.</p>\n<p>Why does MediaFire use these technologies?</p>\n<p>MediaFire and our third-party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience, increased functionality and to recognize you across different services and devices.</p>\n<p>We use these cookies both when you visit our site and Services via a browser and our mobile app.\nAs we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.</p>\n<p>Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions.\nThey are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to serve you relevant and targeted ads.\nWe use cookies and similar technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent).\nYou are free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device allows this, but if you disable them, then certain functionalities will break or be unavailable.\nYou can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in your browser or device settings.</p>\n<p>To help Us help You to \u2026</p>\n<ul>\n<li>save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service,</li>\n<li>match you to your personal
