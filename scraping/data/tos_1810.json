qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Use Policy.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award, on an individual basis, the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must interpret and apply the terms of this

for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nWe also both agree that You or we may bring suit in court to seek injunctive relief for infringement or other threatened or actual violation of intellectual property rights.\n</b>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent 4ocean Public Benefit Corporation, Attention: Alex J.\nSchulze, Registered Agent, 3600 FAU Boulevard, Boca Raton, FL 33431.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by and under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Boca Raton, Florida, or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>\n<b>R.\nDesignated Agent </b>\n</p>\n<p>All notices and communications with respect to the Use Policy

one pound of trash removed is an approximation based on total revenues of the bracelets and total trash removed from the ocean by 4ocean within 12&nbsp;months of the period of time that the bracelet was&nbsp;sold.\nSome of the trash that has been allocated to the 4ocean one pound per bracelet pledge&nbsp;throughout this website may not have been removed straight from the ocean but from a

environment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Net Profit:&nbsp;</strong>The Net Profit for temporary campaigns will be calculated as: The total sales accrued from the particular bracelet subtracted from the

every precaution to protect our users\u2019 information.\nWhen users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.\nWhen our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is</p>\n<p>encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.\nWhile on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Internet</p>\n<p>Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just \u2018surfing\u2019.\nTo learn more about SSL, follow this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.\nAll of our users\u2019 information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.\nOnly employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.\nOur employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.\nWhen they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.\nFurthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.\nEvery quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers\u2019 information is protected.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.\nIf you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an</p>\n<p>email to info@4Ocean.com.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>N.\nSpecial Offers</p>\n<p>New and established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and our newsletter.\nOut of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.\nPlease see our choice and opt-out in letter Q below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>O.\nSite and Service Updates</p>\n<p>We also send the user site and service announcement updates.\nUsers are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service.\nWe communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regard to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>P.\nYour Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>We give you access and control of your personal data as described

respect to your information,</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Q.\nData Retention</p>\n<p>We will retain your data for a period of 6 months from the time we first collect your data if you have no additional activity or until you opt out, whichever comes first.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>R.\nPolicies for Children</p>\n<p>In order to respect the privacy of minors, 4ocean does not knowingly collect, maintain or process Personal Information submitted online via our Internet Services by anyone under the age of 18.\nTo the extent 4ocean collects Personal Information on minors in the context of one of the purposes mentioned in the Statement, 4ocean will only do so with the appropriate consent or as otherwise permitted under applicable laws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>S.\nYour California Privacy Rights</p>\n<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, California customers are entitled to request information relating to whether a business has disclosed Personal Information to any third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes.\n4ocean does not sell or share your Personal Information with third-party companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>T.\nInternational Data Transfers</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will rely on multiple legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world.\nThese include</p>\n<p>your consent, the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, and EU Commission approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections.\nYou may obtain copies of the model contractual clauses by contacting us.\n4ocean complies with the Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information as described

us.\nYou can also refer a complaint to our chosen independent dispute resolution</p>\n<p>body, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution\u00ae at http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that the countries where we operate may have privacy and data protection laws that</p>\n<p>differ from, and are potentially less protective than, the laws of your country.\nYou agree to this risk</p>\n<p>when you create a 4ocean's account and click \u201cI agree\u201d to data transfers, irrespective of which</p>\n<p>country you live in.\nIf you later wish to withdraw your consent, you can delete your information as</p>\n<p>described in the Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint regarding your information with the proper supervising authority.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>U.\nCorrection/Updating Personal Information:</p>\n<p>If a user\u2019s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user\u2019s personal data provided to us.\nThis can usually be done at the user account page or by emailing our Customer Support at info@4Ocean.com or by sending a written request to: </p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4ocean Public

informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>V.\nNotification of Changes</p>\n<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Website, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.\nIf at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.\nUsers will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.\nWe will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under</p>\n<p>which the information was
