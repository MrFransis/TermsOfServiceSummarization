Store</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data We Publish</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third-party services</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>Data Principles<p>Our data practices \u2013 and the ways that we design and develop software \u2013 are\ngoverned by the following main principles.</p>1.\nPurpose Limitation<p>We collect data that is relevant to the examination and characterization of\nnetworks, particularly with the goal of identifying internet censorship and\nother forms of network interference.</p>\n<p>We also collect data that enables us to improve OONI tools and better serve\nthe OONI community.</p>2.\nUser Safety<p>OONI Probe is <em>not</em> a privacy tool, but we care about privacy and\nthe well-being of our community.</p>\n<p>We therefore design and develop OONI Probe tests (and the broader OONI software\necosystem) with user safety in mind.</p>\n<p>This is why, for example, we do our best <em>not</em> to collect any\npersonally-identifiable information.</p>3.\nUser Control<p>Running OONI Probe can potentially be risky,\nand different users have different threat models.\nIt\u2019s therefore important to us\nthat OONI Probe users are able to customize their testing depending on their\nthreat model and what they feel comfortable with.</p>\n<p>To this end, we provide settings in OONI software that enable users to <strong>opt\nout</strong> from various different types of data collection and publication.\nWe also\nenable OONI Probe users to test the URLs of their choice.</p>4.\nOpen By Default<p>To increase transparency of internet censorship around the world, the OONI software ecosystem has been designed in such a way\nthat we (automatically) <strong>openly publish all OONI Probe measurements</strong> that get\nsent to our servers.\nAll OONI software (including our infrastructure) is open source, enabling the independent, third-party verification of statements made in this Data Policy.</p>5.\nAccessible and Usable<p>We openly publish all OONI measurements in machine-readable format, so that they\ncan more easily be accessed, used, and integrated into other systems.</p>\n<p>To enable researchers and data scientists to make use of OONI data, we offer several methods for accessing, downloading, and analyzing the data.</p>\n<p>To enable human rights defenders, journalists, and the general public to access\nand use OONI data, we have built OONI Explorer: a web platform that includes\ncharts and a search tool for exploring OONI measurements.</p>6.\nPublic Archive<p>Our goal is to enable future generations (and current researchers and human\nrights defenders) to learn about internet censorship through longitudinal OONI\nmeasurements.</p>\n<p>We therefore do our best to preserve a public archive of all OONI\nmeasurements that we collect and openly publish.</p>\n<p>As a result, we refrain from deleting OONI measurements (unless there are\nuser safety concerns), and we continuously work towards improving our analysis\nand storage capabilities for the public archival of all OONI measurements\ncollected from around the world.</p>Analytics<p>We primarily use analytics to receive crash reports, which enables us to identify and\nfix bugs, and to improve the performance of the OONI Probe apps.</p>OONI Probe apps<p>For the OONI Probe mobile app, we use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Countly (self-hosted).\nWe use open source Countly\nanalytics (which we host ourselves) for <strong>sending push notifications</strong>.\nIf\nyou opt in to push notifications on OONI Probe Android, we will collect\ninformation necessary for sending push notifications (see \u201cData We Collect\u201d\nsection for more details).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sentry.\nIf you opt in to sharing <strong>crash reports</strong> with us, we\nwill collect sanitized technical data, including device identifier information,\nwhich will help us understand why the OONI Probe app has crashed.\nWe do not\ncollect the IP address or a unique identifier of the user.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On F-Droid, we do <em>not</em> use any analytics.</p>\n<p>For the OONI Probe desktop app, we use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sentry.\nIf you opt in to sharing <strong>crash reports</strong> with us, we will collect\nsanitized technical data, including device identifier information, which will\nhelp us understand why the OONI Probe app has crashed.\nWe do not collect the IP\naddress or a unique identifier of the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Details about our specific setup can be found in ooni/sysadmin.</p>\n<p>On both the OONI Probe mobile and desktop apps, you can opt in to sharing\ncrash reports during the onboarding process.\nIf you\nchange your mind, you can opt out through the settings of the apps.</p>OONI website<p>We use the open source Matomo analytics platform (which we host ourselves) to\ncollect data on how many visits OONI Explorer and our website receive.\nThis is\ndone <strong>without the use of cookies</strong>.\nSince we do not use cookies or track any\npersonal data, these analytics are enabled by default.</p>\n<p>We do not record the full IP address of users (which is \u201canonymised\u201d to the\nfirst 3 octets, ex.\n123.45.67.0).</p>\n<p>You can opt out of our use of analytics on OONI Explorer and the OONI website\nby <strong>unchecking the opt-out box</strong> at the end of this Data Policy.</p>\n<p>We will notify you of any future changes to our use of analytics through an\nupdate to this Data Policy.</p>OONI ProbeData We Collect<p>We collect different types of network measurements when you run different types\nof OONI Probe tests.\nYou can learn how each OONI Probe test works (and what\ntypes of network measurements are collected) through the OONI Probe test specifications and test descriptions.</p>\n<p>Details about the collected network measurements are available on OONI Explorer and the OONI API.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of sending us your measurements through the settings in the OONI\nProbe apps.</p>\n<p>If you <em>don\u2019t</em> opt out of sending us your measurements, we will collect the\nfollowing types of data by default when you run OONI Probe.</p>Date and time of measurements<p>We <strong>always</strong> collect the time and date of measurements when you run OONI Probe.\nThis data helps us evaluate when a measurement was collected and to\ncompare measurements over time.\n<strong>You cannot opt out of sending us this type\nof data.</strong>\n</p>Country code<p>By default, we automatically transmit your IP address to our ASN\ndatabase to identify the country in\nwhich you are located.\nWe then obtain a two-letter country code from this\ndatabase (for example, \u201cIT\u201d for Italy) and store it along with the rest of your\ntest results.</p>\n<p>Knowing the country from which our users are running OONI Probe allows us to locate any\nnetwork interference the software identifies to a specific country.\nSuch\ninformation may be useful to researchers, journalists, and advocates who aim to\ndiscover network interference (such as censorship and traffic manipulation).</p>\n<p>You cannot opt out of sending us your country code as this information is\nessential (i.e.\nwithout the country code, we don\u2019t know where a measurement came\nfrom, limiting its value).</p>Network information<p>By default, we collect your corresponding network <strong>Autonomous System Number (ASN)</strong>\nwhen you run OONI Probe.</p>\n<p>Collecting ASNs helps our work by revealing the identity\nof network providers that engage in censorship or other forms of network\ninterference.\nFor example, if you run OONI Probe on Vodafone Italia, we would collect\n<code>AS30722</code>, which is the corresponding ASN.</p>\n<p>We also collect information to identify if an OONI Probe user is on a <strong>WiFi network</strong> or\nusing <strong>mobile data</strong>.</p>\n<p>This information can be useful for distinguishing measurements collected from\nmobile and fixed-line networks, as well as for sending out push notifications\nand encouraging automatic OONI Probe testing.\nFor example, if you are on WiFi\nand you have opted-in to push notifications, we may send you a push notification\nencouraging you to test a long list of URLs.</p>\n<p>You cannot opt out of submitting your network ASN or information about the type\nof network (e.g.\nWiFi) you are running OONI Probe on, as this information is\nnecessary in order for measurements to be useful.</p>Network measurements<p>We collect different types of network measurements when you run different types\nof OONI Probe tests.</p>\n<p>You can learn how each OONI Probe test works (and what\ntypes of network measurements are collected) through the OONI Probe test\nspecifications and test descriptions.</p>\n<p>Details about the collected network measurements are available on OONI Explorer and the OONI API.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of sending us any of your measurements through the settings in the OONI\nProbe apps.</p>Crash reports<p>During the onboarding process, OONI Probe users can opt in to send us crash\nreports.\nThis information is essential for identifying bugs and improving the\nperformance of the OONI Probe apps.</p>\n<p>These crash reports include the OONI Probe software version, device identifier\ninformation, and information about why and how a specific OONI Probe function\nfailed to work as expected.</p>\n<p>You can opt in or opt out of sending us crash reports by enabling or disabling\nthis option in the settings of the OONI Probe apps.</p>IP addresses and other information<p>We do <em>not</em> aim to collect or store your IP addresses.\nIn fact, we take measures\nto remove them from our database of collected measurements to reduce the risk to\nyou.</p>\n<p>However, we <strong>might unintentionally</strong> collect your IP addresses and other\npersonally-identifiable information if this data is included in the HTTP headers\nor other metadata of OONI measurements.\nThis data, for example, might be collected if\nthe websites OONI Probe is testing employ tracking technologies or contain custom content.</p>\n<p>If you run the performance tests included in the OONI Probe apps, the Measurement Lab (M-Lab) will collect and publish your IP address, irrespective of your OONI Probe settings.\nLearn more about M-Lab\u2019s data governance through its privacy statement.</p>Information required for push notifications<p>If you <strong>opt in to push notifications</strong> via the OONI Probe mobile app, we will\ncollect information required for identifying and authenticating probes to send out push notifications.</p>\n<p>This may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Information about the OONI Probe installation (such as software version,\nsupported tests, platform, device language, device timezone);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Network information (such as probe ASN and network type) and country code;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Approximate geographical location (based on your IP address) in order to send\ngeo-targeted push notifications;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information necessary to deliver push notifications, such as the push notification token.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>Data We Process<p>We process all the collected OONI Probe network measurements through our\ndata processing pipeline.</p>\n<p>We try to make sense of the data and to find answers to the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Which types of OONI Probe tests were run?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In which countries were those tests run?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In which networks were those tests run?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When were those tests run?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What types of network interference occurred?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In which countries did network interference occur?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In which networks did network interference occur?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When did network interference occur?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How did network interference occur?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can opt out of sending us certain types or all of your measurements by\ndisabling the relevant options in the settings of the OONI Probe apps.</p>Data We Store<p>By default, we store ALL of the data that your copy of OONI Probe sends us when\nyou run a test.\nThis may include information that <em>might</em> be personally-identifying,\nsuch as your IP address or other information contained in the HTTP headers.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of sending us your measurements by\ndisabling the relevant setting in the privacy tab of the OONI Probe apps.</p>\n<p>Data required for sending out push notifications will be stored separately on a\nsecure database server operated by OONI (which is different from the public\nmetadb that hosts OONI Probe measurements).</p>Data We Publish<p>We publish ALL of the OONI Probe network measurement data that we have collected\nand stored to allow third parties to conduct independent studies, verify our\nfindings, and answer other research questions.</p>\n<p>Currently, we publish all OONI measurement data both through our OONI API and through an interactive\nweb interface, called OONI Explorer.</p>\n<p>For more information on the license under which the data is released, see\ngithub.com/ooni/license/data.</p>\n<p>We will <em>not</em> publish data related to analytics and push notification support, both of which are securely stored separately from the public measurement metadb.</p>Third-party services<p>The performance tests included in the OONI Probe apps are conducted against third-party servers\nprovided by Measurement Lab (M-Lab).\nM-Lab\u2019s\nservices require the retention and disclosure of IP addresses for research\npurposes.\nLearn more about M-Lab\u2019s data governance through its privacy statement.</p>\n<p>We reserve all rights to make future changes to this Data Policy at our sole\ndiscretion.</p>\n<p>For questions and comments on this Data Policy, please contact the OONI team:\n<strong>contact@openobservatory.org</strong>.</p>\n<code>Key ID:
