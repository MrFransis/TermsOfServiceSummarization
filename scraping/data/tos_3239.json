identifiable information is not treated as PII unless we combine it with or link it to PII that you give to us.\nIf you do not wish to disclose any required information, then your sole remedies shall

training for our staff or customer service representatives.\nAny information obtained from you through Customer support will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Policy.</p>\n<strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong>\n<p>Even if you do not provide information to us, we automatically collect certain information about your use and interaction with

or combine it with your information to provide better service to you and inform you of Services or other information that may be of interest to you.\nOur Site offers you the functionality of using your social media credentials (e.g.\nFacebook, Google, Miro, etc.) to use single-sign-on to enter our Site, and in that manner, we may also collect certain information from you as you log on.\nWe will

users and/or an administrator of your Account.</p>\n<p>We may share your information with third parties as necessary to provide Services to you or to support the technical operation and/or maintenance of our Services, including third party application that you may engage within the Services.\nWe may also share information with our affiliates, agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf.\nWhen a third party acts solely on our behalf and otherwise as applicable, we use reasonable commercial efforts to require that party to follow the privacy practices stated in this Policy or have complementary privacy protections to protect your information.\nWe do not share your information with unaffiliated third parties except as permitted to do so in this Policy.</p>\n<strong>Disclosure Without Your Consent</strong>\n<p>In general, we may disclose your information without your consent to disclosure when we reasonably believe disclosure is appropriate in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Comply with the law (e.g., lawful subpoena or court order);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cooperate with or report to law enforcement agencies in investigations that involve
