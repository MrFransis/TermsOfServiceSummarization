histories and the amount of deposit will vary.\nThe deposit will remain on your account for up to 12 months or longer, depending upon your payment performance and Applicable Law.\nThe deposit may be refunded to you or applied as a credit to your bill in accordance with Applicable Law.\nUpon termination of Service, the deposit will be posted to your account and applied to any unpaid balance for

Taxes and Fees:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n1.&nbsp.\nCharges and Rates:</b>\n</p>\n<p>You agree to pay by the due date on your Cox bill all charges associated with the Services and

under a promotion, after the promotional period ends, the then-current regular retail rate for the Service(s) will apply.\nThe retail rates for Cox Services and Cox Equipment may be found on the Cox Website, in your Welcome Kit, by calling your local Cox office, visiting your local Cox retail store, or, for phone, in the applicable tariff or state Telephone Service Guide.\nAll fees do not apply to all Services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.&nbsp.\nGovernmental Taxes and Fees:</b>\n<br> You must pay all federal, state and local taxes, franchise fees and any other fees or payment obligations imposed by government or quasi-governmental bodies however described, levied or assessed which are applicable to the Services or Cox Equipment we provide you.\nUnless required by Applicable Law, we may elect not to provide notice of a change in fees or taxes.\nYou will be responsible for paying any government imposed Surcharges that become applicable retroactively.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.&nbsp.\nOther Cox or Third Party Surcharges and Fees:</b>\n<br> You must pay all other Cox imposed surcharges and fees we may assess in connection with the Services or the Cox Equipment (collectively \u201cSurcharges\u201d).\nThese Surcharges may include, but are not limited to, the Broadcast Surcharge, Regional Sports Surcharge, federal Universal Service fees, telecommunications relay service fees, carrier cost recovery fees, FCC Access Fees, subscriber line charges, network interface fees, network access charges.\nand any other regulatory and administrative costs we incur to provide the Services and comply with governmental programs.\nThese Surcharges are not government mandated fees or taxes but are charges that are either allowed to be passed through by governmental agencies or are imposed by Cox in order to facilitate the provision of the Services or the Cox Equipment.&nbsp.\nA description of some or all of these surcharges and fees may be found on cox.com under Billing and Account Support.&nbsp.\nAdditionally, certain network providers may assess per minute surcharges or fees for calls that terminate to international wireless telephone numbers or additional surcharges or fees for traffic termination, which may impact the amount of Surcharges charged to you in Cox providing the Service (\u201cPhone Surcharges\u201d).\nThe amount and type of these Phone Surcharges may vary depending upon the location of your Premises.\nCertain Surcharges, including some Phone Surcharges, may occur or fluctuate according to amounts or limits set by the government that Cox may pass through to you.&nbsp.\nCox may not always provide advance notice if those changes cause adjustments in the amount of the Surcharges charged to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.&nbsp.\nThird-Party Charges That Are Your Responsibility:</b>\n<br> You acknowledge that you may incur charges with third-party providers such as for accessing on-line services, calling parties who charge for their telephone-based services, purchasing or subscribing to other offerings via the Internet, or interactive options on your video service that are separate and apart from amounts charged by us.\nYou are solely responsible for all such charges payable to third parties, including all applicable taxes, fees or surcharges.\nIn addition, you are solely responsible for protecting the security of credit card, debit card, other financial information, or other personal information provided to others in connection with such transactions.&nbsp.\nYou have the ability to block third party phone charges, such as collect and operator assisted calls.&nbsp.\nPlease call Cox Customer Care if you would like to block these third party charges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.&nbsp.\nUnreturned Equipment Charges:</b>\n<br> If you upgrade, downgrade, disconnect or swap-out Cox Equipment related to any Cox Service and do not promptly return the Cox Equipment or if it is returned damaged (\u201cUnreturned Equipment\u201d), the damages Cox will incur will be difficult to ascertain.\nTherefore, Cox may charge your account for each Unreturned Equipment piece, a one-time Unreturned Equipment Charge as liquidated damages in an amount equal to Cox\u2019s reasonable estimates of the replacement costs and incidental costs that Cox incurs.\nprovided, however, that such amount will not exceed the maximum amount permitted by law or the replacement cost of the Cox Equipment.\nIf you return your Cox Equipment to Cox by mail, you will be responsible for (i) any damage to the Cox Equipment as assessed by Cox upon receipt, (ii) the replacement cost of such Cox Equipment if it is lost or damaged during transit, and (iii) shipping/handling costs, unless Cox provides written notice in advance that it will pay such costs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.&nbsp.\nUnauthorized and Disputed Charges:</b>\n<br> If you do not agree with a charge on your bill or you believe it is an unauthorized charge you must (i) pay undisputed amounts by the due date listed on your bill and (ii) notify Cox no later than sixty (60) days after the date of the bill (or such later date as required by law) of the disputed or unauthorized charges by calling or writing to us at the number and address specified on your bill and submit any documentation or other information to substantiate your claim of unauthorized charges.\nYou waive any disputes or credits that you do not report within this 60 day period.&nbsp.\nCox will investigate any disputed charges and will use reasonable efforts to advise you of the results of our investigation within thirty (30) days after Cox\u2019s receipt of your notice of dispute.\nCox may, in its sole discretion, waive such charges.\nYou will be responsible for charges or other obligations or liabilities associated with any improper, illegal or unauthorized use of the Services, Licensed Software and Cox Equipment as described in Section 13 below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nPayments and Billings:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.&nbsp.\nAuthorized Payment Methods:</b>\n<br> All

bill.\n(ii) automated electronic drafts from your checking account.\n(iii) delivering cash, a check or money order payable to Cox, or paying by credit or debit card at a Cox retail store.\n(iv) delivering cash, a check or money order payable to Cox, or paying by credit or debit card at a Cox-authorized payment center (which may charge a convenience fee).\n(v) providing a credit or debit card payment to a Cox customer service representative or Cox authorized automated payment system over the telephone.\nor (vi) paying by credit or debit card through the Cox website.\nYou agree not to make any notations or restrictions on your checks or on other forms for payment such as \u201cpaid in full\u201d and you agree that any such restriction has no legal effect.\nIf you use a credit or debit card to pay for any charges, taxes, fees or Surcharges, you acknowledge that use of the card is governed by the card issuer agreement, and you must refer to that agreement for your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.\nIf Cox does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand.&nbsp.\nWhen you provide a check as payment, you authorize us either to use information from your check to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account or to process the payment as a check transaction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nBilling and Late Payments:</b>\n<br> Unless you are subject to a Minimum Term Agreement, Service(s) are provided to you on a month-to-month basis.&nbsp.\nRecurring charges and taxes are due in advance once Service is initiated.\nCharges accrue through a full billing period.\nCox may prorate or adjust a bill if the billing period covers less than or more than a full month (for this purpose, each month is considered to have 30 days).\nunless you subscribe to a pay-as-you-go service which is not prorated and is billed for a full month.\nWe will determine the billing period and may change the billing period from time to time.\nCox will determine and may change the billing format from time to time.\nYou may be billed for some Service(s) individually after they have been provided to you, including without limitation measured and per-call charges, operator-assisted or directory assistance charges, charges for pay-per-view or On Demand movies or events, data usage overage charges and one time charges such as service call charges.&nbsp.\nIf you fail to make full payment by the payment due date set forth on your bill statement, Cox reserves all rights it may have, subject to Applicable Law, to terminate Service or place the Service(s) in Soft Disconnection, remove Cox Equipment, collect the full amount due, including, without limitation, any applicable interest, costs of collection (including attorneys\u2019 fees and third party agent collection fees), late fees (subject to state law and regulations), door collection fees, bank fees and any other applicable fees, charges or payments.\nAny balance amount that remains delinquent may be referred to a third party for collections.\nOnce the debt is referred to a third party for collection, you may be subject to and agree to reimburse Cox for additional fees, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and fees related to costs and expenses, which may be based on a percentage of up to 25% of the balance owed (subject to state law and regulations).&nbsp.\nFor past due balances assigned to a field collector for payment, a fee of up to $25.00, or up to the maximum amount allowed by law or regulation, will be charged to your Cox account, regardless of how you make your payment.\nYou may be required to pay a reactivation or reinstallation fee and/or a deposit in addition to all past dues charges before Service may be reconnected or restored.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.&nbsp.\nReturned Payment:</b>\n<br> If your payment by check is returned, your payment via credit card is denied, or your electronic funds transfer is denied due to insufficient funds, or a closed account, you authorize Cox to make a one-time electronic fund transfer from your account to collect the amount of the payment plus any applicable returned payment fees of up to $25.00 or up to the maximum amount allowed by law or regulation.\nWhen payment is

controversies between you and Cox, including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of Cox, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort) or other legal or equitable theory (\u201cDispute\u201d) that arise out of or in any way relate to this Agreement, any of the Services provided under this Agreement or any other Services or products that Cox provides to you in connection with this Agreement (including but not limited to amounts that Cox charges you for Services or products provided, any alleged breach related to the collection, retention or disclosure of your personal information, and any alleged violation of our Privacy Notice).&nbsp.\nYou and Cox also agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes that arise out of or relate in any way to any services or products provided to you by Cox or any of its affiliated entities under any other agreement.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you and Cox may bring appropriate Disputes against each other in small claims court, if the Dispute falls within the small claims court's jurisdiction, or before the Federal Communications Commission, the relevant state public utilities commission, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear the Dispute.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>B.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Opt Out:</b>\n<br> You may opt out of this dispute resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver contained in Section 4(g) below) by notifying Cox of that intent during the Opt-Out Period by sending an email to Cox at ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com or a letter via U.S.\nmail to Cox Legal Department, Attn:&nbsp.\nLitigation Counsel, 6205B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328 stating that you are opting out of this dispute resolution provision.&nbsp.\nExercising this right, should you choose to do so, will not affect any of the other terms of this Agreement with Cox, and you may remain a Cox customer.&nbsp.\nIf you opt out of the dispute resolution provision, that opt out will remain in effect if Cox modifies this section in the future or you agree to a new term of service under this Agreement.&nbsp.\nIf you enter into a new agreement with Cox that includes a dispute resolution provision and you want to opt out of that provision, you will need to follow the instructions in that agreement for opting out.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nClass Action Waiver:</b>\n<br> You and Cox agree that all Disputes between you and Cox will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.&nbsp.\nIf you or Cox brings a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of us can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.\nFurthermore, neither you nor Cox may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts Disputes that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or Cox.\nWe both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this Section 4 will not apply to any Dispute between you and Cox, except for the provisions of Section 4(g) waiving the right to jury trial.\nThis class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>D.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Arbitrator Authority:</b>\n<br> The arbitration between you and Cox will be binding.&nbsp.\nIn arbitration, there is no judge and <u>no jury.</u>&nbsp.\nInstead, our disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement.\nYou and Cox agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.\nAn arbitrator may award attorneys' fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the Applicable Law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with Cox.&nbsp.\nReview of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>E.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Informal Dispute Resolution:</b>\n<br> You and Cox agree that you will try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration.\n&nbsp;If you have a dispute, first call Cox Customer Care at the number listed on your monthly bill statement.&nbsp.\nIf the Cox representative is unable to resolve your dispute in a timely manner, you agree to then notify Cox of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to Cox Customer Care, ATTN: Corporate Escalation Team, 6205B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328 so that Cox can attempt to resolve it with you.&nbsp.\nIf Cox does not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving written notice to Cox Customer Care of your claim, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration.&nbsp.\nNeither you nor Cox may initiate arbitration without first following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph and thereafter, if the dispute is still not resolved, the party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other written notice of the intent to file for arbitration.&nbsp.\nIf you are sending a written notice of your intent to file for arbitration to Cox, please send such notice via U.S.\nmail to Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328.\nIf Cox is sending you a written notice of our intent to file for arbitration, we will send it to the last known address of record we have on file for you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>F.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Arbitration Procedures:</b>\n<br> You and Cox agree that this Agreement and the services Cox provides to you affects interstate commerce and

are available on its website at <u>www.adr.org</u>&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nIf the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply.\nIf the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.&nbsp.\nIf there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control.\nTo initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to Cox at <u>ArbitrationOptOut@cox.com</u> or via U.S.\nmail to Cox Legal Department, Attn: Litigation Counsel, 6205B Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328.\nYou must also comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration.\nCox will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys' fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or Applicable Law.\nCox will not seek to recover its fees and costs from you in the arbitration, even if allowed under the law, unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous.\nIf you are successful in the arbitration, Cox will pay your reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\nIf you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than Cox's last written settlement offer, Cox will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration will be held in the county of the billing address where Cox provided you service and either party may appear either in person or by telephone.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>G.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nJury Trial Waiver:</b>\n<br> If for any reason this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you opt out of this dispute resolution agreement, you and Cox expressly and knowingly <b>WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.</b> This means that a Judge rather than a Jury will decide disputes between you and Cox if, for any reason, the arbitration agreement is not enforced.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>H.\n&nbsp.\nSurvival:</b> This dispute resolution provision survives the termination of your Services with Cox.\nIf you bring a claim against Cox after termination of your Services that is based in whole or in part on events or omissions that occurred while you were a Cox customer, this dispute resolution provision shall apply.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<u>Return to top</u>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nACCESS TO YOUR PREMISES

to block robot calls, you may be asked by the third party to consent to separate terms and conditions governing your use of its service.<br>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Rounding Up Charges for Voice Usage</b>:<br> Any calls you make or receive using your Cox Phone Services are rated on full minutes of use and minutes are rounded up to the nearest whole minute.\nFor example, a call that lasts for 5 minutes will be billed for 5 minutes of usage, and a call that last for 5 minutes and 1 second will be billed for 6 minutes of usage.<br> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Phone Number Portability</b>:<br> When we assign a phone number to you, you will not have any rights to it, other than your right to port your phone number to another carrier who will accept that number and consistent with applicable regulations.\nYou may authorize another carrier to transfer your number from Cox to that carrier.\nBy porting your number, you are terminating all Cox Phone Services, features and applications that Cox provides to you associated with that telephone number.\nhowever, you will be responsible for all charges that you incur prior to this deactivation, for any applicable Early Termination Fee, and charges that apply to any Cox Phone Services, features or applications associated with other telephone numbers that have not been ported.&nbsp.\nThe telephone numbers utilized for Cox Phone Service are assigned in accordance with applicable federal and state numbering rules.\nTherefore, Cox cannot accommodate the assignment of a telephone number outside of the telephone rate center to which that number is appropriately assigned.<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Equipment Requirements and Charges</b>:<br> A telephone modem may be required for the duration of your Cox Phone Service subscription.\nCox may provide such modem to you.&nbsp.\nIf Cox provides the telephone modem to you, upon disconnection of Cox Phone Service, the Cox modem must be returned within 30 days of disconnection of such Service or an Unreturned Equipment Charge may apply.<br>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Customer Equipment</b>:<br> You are responsible for ensuring that any telephone handsets modems, or other Customer Equipment not issued by Cox that you use with Cox Phone Service are compatible with the service.\nCox is not responsible if you are unable to use the service or for interruption, failure, or degradation of the service caused by such Customer Equipment.<br> &nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Backup Power for Telephone Service</b>:<br> The telephone modem or gateway and certain other telephone service related devices use household electrical power to operate.\nCox Voice Service will not be available during a power outage without a backup battery in the telephone modem or gateway or other telephone service related device(s).&nbsp.\nYou may purchase a backup battery for Cox-provided modems or gateways&nbsp.\nthat will enable your Cox Voice Service to continue to operate for up to twenty-four hours in standby mode or up to 12 hours of talk time during a power outage using a corded phone connected directly to the telephone modem or gateway.\n(Cordless phones require a power source separate from the backup battery.\nCox recommends you keep a corded phone for use in the event of an outage.) &nbsp;If you are a Lifeline customer, you may obtain a battery from Cox without charge.\nIf (i) the modem that supplies your Cox Phone Service is disconnected or moved, (ii) the backup battery is not charged or otherwise becomes inoperable, or (iii) there is an extended power outage, Cox Voice Service, including access to E911, will not be available.&nbsp;<b>It is your responsibility to monitor the health of the battery and obtain a replacement (see www.cox.com/battery) if the battery is reaching the end of its useful life.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Emergency Services and Home

functionality furnished by other providers.\nAs such, it may have certain limitations.\nCAREFULLY READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT ANY LIMITATIONS OF 911.\nYOU AGREE TO CONVEY THESE LIMITATIONS TO ALL PERSONS THAT MAY HAVE OCCASION TO PLACE CALLS OVER THE SERVICES.\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 911, VISIT WWW.COX.COM OR CALL COX CUSTOMER CARE AT THE NUMBER LOCATED

battery or if the modem is moved or inoperable.\nIf you have a home alarm system or home health monitoring system that relies on your telephone line to operate, you will lose access to the service during a power outage unless you have a backup battery.&nbsp.\nIf Cox does not provide a modem or backup battery power for Services utilizing a telephone modem, you may provide it and assume all responsibility for its maintenance.\nCox uses your Cox Phone Service address to allow emergency responders to identify your location for 911 Service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>B.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>Location Information:</b>\n<br> In order for your 911 calls to be properly directed to emergency services, Cox must have your correct Premises address.\nIf you move Cox Phone Service(s) to a different address without Cox\u2019s approval, 911 calls may be directed to the wrong emergency authority, may transmit the wrong address, and/or the wireline Cox Phone Services (including 911) may fail altogether.\nTherefore, you must call Cox Customer Care at the number listed on your bill statement before you move your wireline Cox Phone Service to a new address.\nCox will need several business days to update your Premises address in the 911 system so that your 911 calls can be properly directed.\nAll changes in service address require Cox\u2019s prior approval.&nbsp.\nTo ensure that 911 dispatch receives your correct address, the telephone modem should not be moved, even inside your home.\nYou must notify Cox in advance if you would like to move or relocate your Cox Phone Service.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>C.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n</b>911 Functionality and Limitations:</b>\n<br> Calls, including calls to 911, may not be

commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies (also known as locally shared objects), HTML5 cookies, or other Tracking Technologies.\nFor information on disabling Flash cookies, go to Adobe\u2019s website <b>\n<u>http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-third-party-local-shared.html</u>\n</b>.\nPlease be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Online Service may not work and that when you revisit the Online Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app.\nTo uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer.\nApple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a \"Do Not Track\" signal to online services you visit.\nNote, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what \"Do Not Track\" means in this context.\nLike many online services, Cox currently does not alter Cox\u2019s practices when Cox receives a

completeness or accuracy of this third party information.\nSome third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies.\nOne way to potentially identify cookies on a web site is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser (<b>\n<u>www.ghostery.com</u>\n</b>), which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser-based cookies associated with the
