Agreement.\n<p>By creating a Tinder account, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the \u201cService\u201d) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you), Safety Tips, and Community Guidelines, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this \"Agreement\").\nIf you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service.</p>\n<p>We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time.\nWe may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices.\nThe most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings and also on gotinder.com, and you should regularly check for the most recent version.\nThe most recent version is the version that applies.\nIf the changes include material changes to your rights or obligations, we will notify you at least 30 days in advance of the changes (unless we\u2019re unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email.\nIf you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.</p>\n2.\nEligibility.\n<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to

U.S.\nTreasury Department\u2019s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition),</li>\n<li>you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations, and</li>\n<li>you have never been convicted of a felony or indictable offense (or crime of similar severity), a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry.</li>\n</ul>\n3.\nYour Account.\n<p>In order to use Tinder, you may sign in using a number of ways, including by Facebook login.\n&nbsp;If you choose to use your Facebook login, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile.\nFor more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for Tinder, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials.\nIf you think someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact us.</p>\n4.\nModifying the Service and Termination.\n<p>Tinder is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful.\nThis means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them.\nWe may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.</p>\n<p>You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in \"Settings\" in the Service.\n<strong>However, if you use a third party payment account such as Apple\u2019s App Store or iTunes Store, as applicable (\u201cApp Store\u201d) or the Google Play Store, you will need to manage in app purchases through such account to avoid additional billing.</strong> Tinder may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement.\nUpon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases.</p>\n<p>For residents of the Republic of Korea, except in the case where we reasonably consider that (i) giving notice is legally prohibited (for instance, when providing notice would either violate applicable laws, regulations, or orders from regulatory authorities or compromise an ongoing investigation conducted by a regulatory authority) or (ii) any notice may cause harm to you, third parties, Tinder, and/or our affiliates (for instance, when providing notice harms the security of the Service), we will without delay notify you of the reason for taking the relevant step.</p>\n<p>After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Tinder: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.</p>\n5.\nSafety.\nYour Interactions with Other Members.\n<p>Though Tinder strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, Tinder is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Service.\nYou agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person.\nIn addition, you agree to review and follow Tinder\u2019s Safety Tips prior to using the Service.\nYou agree that you will not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money to other members.</p>\n<p>YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT TINDER DOES NOT&nbsp;CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS MEMBERS.\nTINDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT OR COMPATIBILITY OF MEMBERS.</p>\n6.\nRights Tinder Grants

Store, carrier billing, Tinder direct billing or other payment platforms authorized by Tinder.\nIf you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to confirm your purchase with the

account, as applicable, to charge you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Auto-Renewal.\nAutomatic Card Payment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your Payment Method will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel.\nAfter your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing.\nYour card payment information will be stored and subsequently used for the automatic card payments in accordance with the Agreement.</p>\n<p>Objections to a payment already made should be directed to Customer support if you were billed directly by Tinder or the relevant third party account such as the App Store.\nYou are also able to object by contacting your bank or payment provider, who can provide further information on your rights as well as applicable time limits.\nYou may unconditionally withdraw your consent to automatic card payments at any time by going to Settings on Tinder or the relevant third party account, but be advised that you are still obligated to pay any outstanding amounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your third party account (or Settings on Tinder, if applicable) and follow the instructions to terminate or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Tinder application from your device.</strong> Deleting your account on Tinder or deleting the Tinder application from your device does not terminate or cancel your subscription.\nTinder will retain all funds charged to your Payment Method until you terminate or cancel your subscription on Tinder or the third party account, as applicable.\nIf you terminate or cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Terms that apply if you pay Tinder directly with your Payment Method.</strong> If you pay Tinder directly, Tinder may correct any billing errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.\nIf you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, Tinder may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion.</p>\n<p>You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting Tinder and going to Settings.\nIf a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information, terminate or cancel your subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated.\nThis may result in a change to your payment billing dates.\nIn addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf you reside outside of the Americas, you agree that your payment to Tinder will be through MTCH Technology Services Limited.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Virtual Items.</strong> From time to time, you may be able to purchase or earn a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use \"virtual items\", which could include virtual products or virtual \u201ccoins\u201d or other units that are exchangeable within the Service for virtual products (collectively, \"Virtual Items\").\nAny Virtual Item balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.\nVirtual Items do not incur fees for non-use, however, the license granted to you in Virtual Items will terminate in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, when Tinder ceases providing the Service or your account is otherwise closed or terminated.\nTinder, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to charge fees for the right to access or use Virtual Items and may distribute Virtual Items with or without charge.\nTinder may manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Items at any time.\nTinder shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that Tinder exercises any such rights.\nVirtual Items may only be redeemed through the Service.\nALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.\nThe provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service is a service that commences immediately upon the acceptance of your purchase of such Virtual Items.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TINDER IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND IN RESPECT OF VIRTUAL ITEMS FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Refunds.</strong> Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.\nWe may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.</p>\n<p>For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area - in accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund without stating the reason during the 14 days after the subscription begins.\nPlease note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.</p>\n<p>For subscribers and purchasers of Virtual Items residing in the Republic of Korea \u2013 in accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund of your subscription and/or unused Virtual Items during the 7 days following the purchase.\nPlease note that this 7-day period commences upon the purchase.</p>\n<p>Except as noted above for members resident in the Republic of Korea, purchases of Virtual Items are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>\n<p>To request a refund:<br>\nIf you made a purchase using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not Tinder.\nTo request a refund, go to the App Store, click on your Apple ID, select \"Purchase history\", find the transaction and hit \"Report Problem\".\nYou can also submit a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.</p>\n<p>If you made a purchase using your Google Play Store account or through Tinder directly: please contact customer support with your order number for the Google Play Store (you can find the order number in the order confirmation email or by logging in to Google Wallet) or Tinder (you can find this on your confirmation email).\nYou may also mail or deliver a signed and dated notice which states that you, the buyer, are canceling this Agreement, or words of similar effect.\nPlease also include the email address or mobile number associated with your account along with your order number.\nThis notice shall be sent to: Tinder, Attn: Cancellations, P.O.\nBox 25472, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA.</p>\n<p>If you use your right of cancellation (except for purchases made through your Apple ID, which Apple controls), we will refund (or ask Google to refund) all payments received from you, without undue delay and in any case within 14 days of the date when we received notice of your decision to cancel the Agreement.\nWe shall make such refund using the same means of payment as used by you in the initial transaction.\nIn any case, no fees will be charged to you as a result of the refund.</p>\n<p>If you made a purchase through a payment platform not listed above, please request a refund directly from the third-party merchant through which you made your purchase.</p>\n<p>You cannot cancel an order for delivery of digital content that is not delivered on a physical medium if order processing has begun with your explicit prior consent and acknowledgement that you will thereby lose your right of cancellation.\nThis applies, e.g., to purchases of Virtual Items.\nThat means that such purchases are FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pricing.</strong> Tinder operates a global business, and our pricing varies by a number of factors.\nWe frequently offer promotional rates - which can vary based on region, length of subscription, bundle size and more.\nWe also regularly test new features and payment options.</p>\n11.\nNotice and Procedure for Making Claims of Copyright Infringement.\n<p>If you believe that your work has been copied and posted on the Service in a way that constitutes copyright

CONTENT, EVEN IF TINDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nIN NO EVENT WILL TINDER\u2019S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, BY YOU TO TINDER FOR THE SERVICE AND USD100 WHILE YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT.</p>\n<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n15.\nArbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver.\n<p>Except for members residing within the EU or European Economic Area and elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or the Service shall be BINDING ARBITRATION&nbsp;administered by JAMS under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures, except as modified by our Arbitration Procedures.\nThe one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court instead if the claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.\nIf the request to proceed in small claims court is made before an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitration shall be administratively closed.\nIf the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitrator has been appointed, the arbitrator shall determine whether the dispute should remain in arbitration or instead be decided in small claims court.\nSuch arbitration shall be conducted by written submissions only, unless either you or Tinder elect to invoke the right to an oral hearing before the Arbitrator.\nBut whether you choose arbitration or small claims court, you agree that you will not under any circumstances commence, or maintain, or participate in against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding against Tinder.</li>\n<li>By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement.\nIn doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court).\nYOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.\nIf you assert a claim against Tinder outside of small claims court (and Tinder does not request that the claim be moved to small claims court), your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all claims and all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute.\nYou are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator can generally grant any relief that a court can, including the ability to hear a dispositive motion (which may include a dispositive motion based upon the parties\u2019 pleadings, as well as a dispositive motion based upon the parties\u2019 pleadings along with the evidence submitted), but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\nFor details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.</li>\n<li>Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIn the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas.\nYou hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.</li>\n<li>The online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under http://ec.europa.eu/odr.\nTinder does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for members residing in the EU or European Economic Area.</li>\n</ol>\n16.\nGoverning Law.\n<p>For members residing in the EU or European Economic Area or elsewhere where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., excluding Texas\u2019s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Service.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15 above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.</p>\n17.\nVenue.\n<p>Except for members residing in the EU or European Economic Area who may bring claims in their country of residence in accordance with applicable law and except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to the Service, or to your relationship with Tinder that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A.\nYou and Tinder consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>\n18.\nIndemnity by You.\n<p>You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Tinder, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.</p>\n19.\nEntire Agreement.\nOther.\n<p>This Agreement, which includes the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, the Safety Tips, Community Guidelines and the Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you), and any terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or services we offer on the Service, contains the entire agreement between you and Tinder regarding the use of the Service.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nThe failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nYou agree that your Tinder account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its Content terminate upon your death.\nNo agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary or other special relationship or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations on behalf of or bind Tinder in any manner.</p>", "created_at": "2018-08-24 14:32:29.292685", "updated_at": "2021-07-08 22:10:57.712132"}, {"id": 385, "name": "Cookie

cookies?\nFirst-party and third-party cookies\n<p>There are first-party cookies and third-party cookies.\nFirst-party cookies are placed on your device directly by us.\nFor example, we use first-party cookies to adapt our website to your browser\u2019s language preferences and to better understand your use of our website.\nThird-party cookies are placed on your device by our partners and service providers.\nFor example, we use third-party cookies to measure user numbers on our website or to enable you to share content with others across social media platforms.</p>\nSession and persistent cookies\n<p>There are session cookies and persistent cookies.\nSession cookies only last until you close your browser.\nWe use session cookies for a variety of reasons, including to learn more about your use of our website during one single browser session and to help you to use our website more efficiently.\nPersistent cookies have a longer lifespan and aren't automatically deleted when you close your browser.\nThese types of cookies are primarily used to help you quickly sign-in to our website again and for analytical purposes.</p>\nWhat about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?\n<p>Other technologies such as web beacons (also calls pixel tags or clear gifs), tracking URLs or software development kits (SDKs) are used for similar purposes.\nWeb beacons are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our service or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.\nTracking URLs are custom generated links that help us understand where the traffic to our webpages comes from.\nSDKs are small pieces of code included in apps, which function like cookies and web beacons.</p>\n<p>For simplicity, we also refer to these technologies as \u201ccookies\u201d in this Cookie Policy.</p>\nWhat do we use cookies for?\n<p>Like most providers of online services, we use cookies to provide, secure and improve our services, including by remembering your preferences, recognizing you when you visit our website and personalizing and tailoring ads to your interests.\nTo accomplish these purposes, we also may link information from cookies with other personal information we hold about you.</p>\n<p>When you visit our website, some or all of the following types of cookies may be set on your

marketing campaigns are, and help us customize and improve our websites for you.\n<strong>Advertising cookies</strong>\nThese cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.\nThey perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, selecting advertisements that are based on your interests and measuring the number of ads displayed and their performance, such as how many people clicked on a given ad.\n<strong>Social networking cookies</strong>\nThese cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our website through third-party social networking and other websites.\nThese cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.\nHow can you control

alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer.\nThe procedure for managing cookies is slightly different for each internet browser.\nYou can check the specific steps in your particular browser help menu.</p>\n<p>You also may be able to reset device identifiers by activating the appropriate setting on your mobile device.\nThe procedure for managing device identifiers is slightly different for each device.\nYou can check the specific steps in the help or settings menu of your particular device.</p>\nInterest-based advertising tools\n<p>You can opt out of seeing online interest-based advertising from participating companies through the Digital Advertising Alliance, the Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance or Appchoices (apps only).</p>\n<p>Opting out does not mean you will not

will need to opt-out again.</p>\nSocial Cookies\n<p>To allow you to share content on social media, some features of this website use social media plug-ins (e.g., Twitter\u2122 \u201cShare to

corresponding button on our website.</p>\n<p>To learn more about social media cookies, we suggest you refer to your social media platform\u2019s cookie policy and privacy policy.</p>\nAdobe Flash Player\u2122 Flash cookies\n<p>Adobe Flash Player\u2122 is an application for viewing and interacting with dynamic content using the Flash platform.\nFlash (and similar applications) use a technology

events and other services operated by Tinder.\nFor simplicity, we refer to all of these as our \u201cservices\u201d in this Privacy Policy.\nTo make it extra clear, we\u2019ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>\n<p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy.\nIf a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p> 3.\nInformation We Collect\n<p>It goes without saying, we can\u2019t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you\u2019d like to meet.\nWe also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account.\nIf you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p>\nInformation you give us\n<p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>\n<li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos.\nTo add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.\nSome of the information you choose to provide us may be considered \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs.\nBy choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</li>\n<li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li>\n<li>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</li>\n<li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</li>\n<li>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.\nSometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</li>\n<li>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.</li>\n<li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</li>\n</ul>\nInformation we receive from others\n<p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Other Users</strong>\nOther users may provide information about you as they use our services.\nFor instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>\nYou may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Tinder account.\nThis saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other Partners</strong>\nWe may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Tinder ads are published on a partner\u2019s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign\u2019s success).</li>\n</ul>\nInformation collected when you use our services\n<p>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you\u2019ve used, how you\u2019ve used them and the devices you use to access our services.\nSee below for more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Information</strong>\nWe collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you\u2019ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device information</strong>\nWe collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google\u2019s AAID and Apple's IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device\u2019 settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address);</li>\n<li>information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength;</li>\n<li>information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other information with your consent</strong>\nIf you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you\u2019re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.\nThe collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren\u2019t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection.\nIf you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.\nSimilarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).</li>\n</ul> 4.\nCookies and Other Similar Data Collection Technologies\n<p>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s).\nYou may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.</p>\n<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201c<strong>DNT</strong>\u201d) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many businesses, including Tinder, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p> 5.\nHow We Use Information\n<p>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services.\nAdditionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.\nRead on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together with practical examples.</p>\nTo administer your account and provide our services to you\n<ul>\n<li>Create and manage your account</li>\n<li>Provide you with customer support and respond to your

automated decision-making, please see our FAQ</li>\n<li>Show users\u2019 profiles to one another</li>\n</ul>\nTo ensure a consistent experience across your devices\n<ul>\n<li>Link the various devices you use so that you can enjoy a consistent experience of our services on all of them.\nWe do this by linking devices and browser data, such as when you log into your account on different devices or by using partial or full IP address, browser version and similar data about your devices to help identify and link them.</li>\n</ul>\nTo provide new Tinder services to you\n<ul>\n<li>Register you and display your profile on new Tinder features and apps</li>\n<li>Administer your account on these new features and apps</li>\n</ul>\nTo serve you relevant offers and ads\n<ul>\n<li>Administer

users).</li>\n</ul>\nTo prevent, detect and fight fraud or other illegal or unauthorized activities\n<ul>\n<li>Address ongoing or alleged misbehavior on and off-platform</li>\n<li>Perform data

described above, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Provide our service to you:</em> Most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with us.\nFor instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Legitimate interests:</em> We may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so.\nFor instance, we analyze users\u2019 behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Consent:</em> From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons.\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us

information is, of course, with other users.\nWe also share some users\u2019 information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities.\nRead on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nWith other users\n<p>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile).\nPlease be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you\u2019re comfortable being publically viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.</p>\n<p>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nWith our service providers and partners\n<p>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.\nThese third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.</p>\n<p>We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services.\nFor instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.</p>\n<p>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner.\nAll of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nWith other Match Group businesses\n<p>Tinder is part of the Match Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes websites and apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24, OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click here).</p>\n<p>We share your information with other Match Group companies for them to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf.\nAssistance provided by other Match Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding how our service is used and users\u2019 behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.</p>\n<p>We may also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws.\nWe may also share user information with other Match Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior.\nIn some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nFor corporate transactions\n<p>We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nWhen required by law\n<p>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements.\n(ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law).\nor (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nTo enforce legal rights\n<p>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit.\n(ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties.\n(iii) to enforce our agreements with you.\nand (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nWith your consent or at your request\n<p>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties.\nIn any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.</p>\n<p>We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances.\nWe may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see.\nWe may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.\nMore information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 7.\nCross-Border Data Transfers\n<p>Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions.\nAs an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA.\nWe use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.\nStandard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data</p> 8.\nYour Rights\n<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Access / Update tools in the service.</u> Tools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that\u2019s associated with your account directly within the service.\nIf you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Device permissions.</u> Mobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications.\nYou can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications.\nOf course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Deletion.</u> You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights.\nHere are a few key points to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Reviewing your information.</u> Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms).\nYou can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Updating your information.</u> If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user.\nIf you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.</p>\n<p>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.\nFor instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Uninstall.</u> You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.\nIf you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored.\nIf you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Accountability.</u> In certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information.\nThe data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</li>\n</ul> 9.\nResidents of California\n<p>If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.\nTo request this notice, please submit your request here.\nPlease allow 30 days for a response.\nFor your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request.</p> 10.\nHow We Protect Your Information\n<p>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information.\nAs with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</p>\n<p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>\n<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security.\nIf you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately here</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that our systems and your information are protected against unauthorized access, theft and loss, we implemented a bug bounty program.\nFor more information about our bug bounty program, please click here.</p> 11.\nHow Long We Retain Your Information\n<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law.\nTo protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account deletion.\nDuring this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.</p>\n<p>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we must keep it to comply with applicable law (for instance, some \u201ctraffic data\u201d is kept for one year to comply with statutory data retention obligations);</li>\n<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li>\n<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved.\nor</li>\n<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security.\nFor example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific timeframe due to technical constraints.</p> 12.\nChildren's Privacy\n<p>Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older.\nWe do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18.\nIf you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</p> 13.\nPrivacy Policy Changes\n<p>Because we\u2019re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time.\nWe will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p> 14.\nHow to Contact Us\n<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, here\u2019s how you can reach us:</p>\nIf you

of our users very seriously.\nAs the world\u2019s most popular app for meeting new people, we take pride in connecting millions of people every day.\nWhile a relatively small percentage of these matches have led to users falling victim to criminal activity,&nbsp;we firmly believe any incident of misconduct or criminal behavior is one too many.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are continuously exploring new updates, partnerships and technologies to enhance and inform our safety efforts while fostering a respectful environment for meeting new people.\nInformation about our safety tools and practices can be found below.\nWhether you\u2019re in Santa Monica, S\u00e3o Paulo or Seoul&nbsp;- our goalremains the same: a safe and positive experience for users on our platform.</p>\n<p>Our Safety Tools:</p>\n<p>We utilize a network of industry-leading automated and manual moderation and review tools, systems and processes - and invest significant resources - to prevent, monitor and remove inappropriate behavior (impersonation, harassment and more) from our app.</p>\n<p>These tools include automatic scans of profiles for red-flag language and images.\nmanual reviews of suspicious profiles, activity, and user generated reports.\nshadow-banning suspicious accounts.\nas well as blocking of email addresses, phone numbers,&nbsp;IP addresses&nbsp;and other identifiers associated with bad actors.</p>\n<p>We have a zero-tolerance policy on harassment&nbsp;and encourage our community to report any instance of misconduct and/or anyone who violates our Community Guidelines&nbsp;or Terms of Use,&nbsp;via the self-reporting tool featured on all Tinder profiles or by contacting our team online.\nIn the event that we receive such a report, our dedicated community team takes appropriate measures, which may include removing the content, banning the user, or notifying the appropriate law enforcement resources.</p>\n<p>We are constantly evaluating and refining our processes, and will always work with law enforcement, where possible, to protect our users.</p>\n<p>Match Group Advisory Council:</p>\n<p>As a part of Match Group,&nbsp;we&nbsp;work with external partners through the&nbsp;Match Group Advisory Council (MGAC), a group of leading experts and advocates involved in the study and prevention of sexual assault, sex trafficking, and similar issues.\nThe executive team at Match Group meets with the MGAC bi-annually to evaluate our policies and solicit recommendations on how to improve safety on our products.\nThe founding members include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scott Berkowitz, President, Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN).</li>\n<li>Tarana Burke, Founder, \u201cMe Too\u201d Movement.</li>\n<li>Catherine Chen, Chief Program Officer, Polaris</li>\n<li>John Clark, CEO, National Center for Missing &amp.\nExploited Children.</li>\n<li>Julie Cordua, CEO, Thorn.</li>\n<li>Yolanda Edrington, COO, National Sexual Violence Resource Center.</li>\n<li>Dr.\nJudy Postmus, Founder, the Center on Violence Against Women &amp.\nChildren, Rutgers University.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Response to Reports of Assault:<br>\nTinder users can easily report instances of abuse or assault in-app or online.\nWe strongly encourage any user who believes they have been a victim of a crime to report it to law enforcement.\nOur team works to promptly investigate reported crimes, assess and take appropriate action, and fully cooperates with law enforcement in any investigation.</p>\n<p>When a user reports an assault to Tinder, we attempt to identify the alleged perpetrator and block the associated account.\nThe incident is then reported to Match Group\u2019s centralized safety repository and checked across our various brands to see if the user has other&nbsp;accounts on other platforms.\nIf any are found, they are blocked as well.</p>\n<p>User Education:<br>\nWe offer safety tips, both online and via the app, to educate and empower users to make smart and safe choices while interacting on Tinder.</p>\n<p>View our Tips for Staying Safe here</p>\n<p>Government Relations and Legislative Work:<br>\nWe understand that it\u2019s our responsibility to play a role in defining the standards for the entire industry - which is why we support Match Group\u2019s efforts to work closely with legislators and regulators across the world to define and pass new safety-focused laws that can help make both our users and those on other tech platforms safe.\nOur team is actively working with several States to promote legislation to help combat catfishing.\nFor more information, please visit here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We welcome the opportunity to work with governments around the world to make the Internet a safer place for everyone.</p>\n<p>Fraud</p>\n<p>We take the issue of fraud very seriously at Tinder.\nWe have a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior of any kind.\nWe have a dedicated fraud team that&nbsp;utilizes&nbsp;a network of industry leading technology that scans for fraud and reviews each and every member profile for red flag language, and conducts manual reviews of suspicious profiles, activity, and user generated reports.&nbsp;Ultimately, no one, whether they met on Tinder or not, should ever send money to someone they haven't met in person.\n&nbsp;In addition, we encourage our members to report any individual who has requested financial information via our self reporting tool.\n&nbsp;Those two steps will greatly assist in stopping almost every scam in its tracks and help protect the next potential victim.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Data Privacy and Platform Security:</p>\n<p>Our users\u2019 privacy is a top priority at Tinder, and we work diligently to ensure that we go above and beyond applicable privacy laws and industry standards.\nWe know that your time on the app is a private matter and have strict policies and technical systems in place, including encryption for user photos and messages and tools that restrict employee access to user communications and other user data.\nWhen it comes to Tinder users\u2019 data, our sole mandate is keeping our users safe and their data private.</p>\n<p>Unlike other social apps, our business model is focused on providing users with premium features, including in-app upgrades and subscriptions, to enhance their experience on our app.\nWe do not sell data to third parties or depend on advertising to maintain or grow our business.\nIn fact, in 2018 less than five percent of all revenue was generated through advertising.\nYour data is yours.\nAs such, users can request a copy of their data here&nbsp;at any time.\nThe most up-to-date information on our data practices is always available to the general public through our Privacy Policy, which can be also accessed through our app.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are constantly improving our defenses in the battle against those with malicious intent.\n&nbsp;However, we do not discuss any specific security tools we use or enhancements we may implement to best protect our users and avoid tipping off any would-be offenders.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Additional Policies&nbsp;and Information:</p>\n<p>Our fundamental goal is to introduce our community of users to new people.\nAnd while this is a lot of fun, it\u2019s important to remember that there are Community Guidelines&nbsp;that our users must abide by to help make Tinder the best app for meeting new people.</p>\n<p>We encourage our users to report any instance of bad behavior on or off our platform.\nReporting a user for inappropriate conduct is straightforward and easy to do.\nOn any given profile, users can tap the \u20183 dots\u2019 icon and select \u2018Report\u2019.\nUsers can also report another user by submitting a help request online.</p>\n<p>Below are more details about some of our policies that we have implemented to keep Tinder more safe.</p>\n<p>Dedication to Inclusion:</p>\n<p>No matter your gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or background, Tinder welcomes you.\nWe strive to make Tinder the most inclusive platform for meeting new people and have worked closely with organizations around the world to constantly improve our practices.\nToday, we offer users more than 50 gender identities in countries around the world and 9 sexual orientations.</p>\n<p>Harassment</p>\n<p>We have a zero-tolerance&nbsp;policy for harassment on our platform.&nbsp;We encourage all users to report any unacceptable behavior so that the community team can investigate and take appropriate action.</p>\n<p>Underage Usage:</p>\n<p>Tinder is for users 18+, and we work hard to vigilantly maintain an adults only community.\nWe utilize a network of industry-leading automated and manual moderation and review tools, systems and processes - and invest significant resources - to prevent and remove minors from our app.</p>\n<p>These tools may include automatic scans of profiles for red-flag language and images, manual reviews of suspicious profiles, activity, and user generated reports, as well as blocking email addresses, phone numbers and other identifiers associated with underage users trying to circumvent these restrictions.\nWe also depend on our users to report any profiles that may depict a minor, so that we can investigate and remove, accordingly.</p>\n<p>We do not want minors on Tinder.\nPeriod.</p>\n<p>Solicitation/Prostitution:</p>\n<p>Solicitation of any kind - whether attempting to buy or sell - is against our Terms of Use.&nbsp;If a user encounters a profile violating our terms, we encourage them to report via the self-reporting tool featured on all Tinder profiles or online.\n&nbsp;Making such a report allows our dedicated community team to take appropriate measures, which may include removing the profile or banning the user.</p>\n<p>Illegal Substances:</p>\n<p>Profiles (or Tinder users) promoting illegal substances violate our Terms of Use and we have a system in place to remove these profiles from the app.\nIf a user encounters a profile violating our terms, we encourage them to report it in within the app.</p>\n<p>Resources for Support, Advice, or Assistance:</p>\n<p>In case of emergency, call 911 (U.S.\nor Canada) or your
