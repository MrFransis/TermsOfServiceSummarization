interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.</p>9.\nData Subject Rights<p>Individuals have rights concerning their personal data.\nIf you wish to exercise your privacy rights under applicable law, including the GDPR, UK GPDR or the CCPA, such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your personal data held with Yotpo, or to restrict or object to such data\u2019s processing, or to port such personal data, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) \u2013 please contact us by e-mail at: privacy@yotpo.com</p>\n<p>Please note that when you ask us to exercise any of your rights under this policy or applicable law, we may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are, to avoid disclosure to you of personal data related to others and to ask you to provide further information to better understand the nature and scope of data that you request to access.\nSuch additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g.\nas proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 4 above.</p>\n<p>We may redact from the data which we will make available to you, any personal data related to others.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding personal data that we process on our customer\u2019s behalf, please contact the customer or the administrator of such customer\u2019s account directly</strong>, as they would be the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data (see Section 10 below).\nNote that if you do contact us in this regard, we may share your communications with the relevant customer and its account users.\nand that we may also share the contact details of the account administrator with individuals who sent us such a request or query relating to this account.</p>10.\nData Controller/Processor<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR, UK GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the \u201c<strong>data controller</strong>\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201c<strong>business</strong>\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing.\nand the \u201c<strong>data processor</strong>\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201c<strong>service provider</strong>\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller (or business).\nBelow we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yotpo is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of Yotpo Website, CRM &amp.\nProspect Data</strong>.\nWith respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nIn such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of \u201cdata processor\u201d.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yotpo is the \u201cdata processor\u201d of Customer Data</strong>, which we process on behalf of our customer (who is the \u201cdata controller\u201d of such data.\nand our Service Providers who process such Customer Data on our behalf are the \u201c<strong>sub-processors</strong>\u201d of such data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Yotpo is both a \u201cdata controller\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d of Yotpo User Data</strong>.\nSuch data is processed by Yotpo for its own purposes (as described in Section 2 above), as an independent \u2018controller\u2019.\nwhilst those certain portions of it which are included in <strong>Customer Data</strong> will be processed by us on our customer\u2019s behalf, as a \u2018processor\u2019.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Yotpo processes <strong>Customer Data</strong> strictly in accordance with such customer\u2019s reasonable instructions and as further stipulated in our Data Processing Addendum and other commercial agreements with such customer.\nThe customer, as controller of such data, will be responsible for meeting any legal requirements applicable to data controllers (such as establishing a legal basis for processing and responding to Data Subject Rights requests concerning the data they control).</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, each customer is solely responsible for establishing a legal basis for proceeding and providing adequate notice to their account users and customers whose data may be contained in Customer Data \u2013 including sufficient reference to the processing of their personal data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws.\nand to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.</p>11.\nAdditional Notices<p>\n<strong>Updates and Amendments</strong>: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Services.\nThe amended version will be effective as of the date it is published.\nWe will provide prior notice if we believe any substantial changes are involved via any of the communication means available to us or via the Services.\nAfter such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>External Links</strong>:

business is located outside of U.S.: If the Yotpo contracting entity is Yotpo UK Limited, then the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to the principles of conflict of law.\nIf the contracting entity is SMSBump, the Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Bulgaria without regard to the principles of conflict of law therein.\nRegardless of the contracting entity, the application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods or other international laws is expressly excluded.</li>\n<li>If you reside in the US or your business is located in the US: You and we agree to arbitrate any claim, cause of action, or dispute between you and us that arises out of or relates to any access or use of the Services for business or commercial purposes (\u201ccommercial claim\u201d).\nThis provision does not cover any commercial claims relating to violations of your or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark infringement, or efforts to interfere with our Services or engage with our Services in unauthorized ways.</li>\n<li>We and you agree that, by entering into this arbitration provision all parties are waiving their respective rights to a trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative action.\nTHE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING.\nYou may bring a commercial claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that any particular commercial claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this paragraph\u2019s limitations, then only that commercial claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court.\nAll other commercial claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this paragraph.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.\nAll issues are for an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and representative actions.\nIf any party intends to seek arbitration of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice in writing.\nThis notice of dispute to us must be sent to the following address:<br> Yotpo, Inc.<br> 400 Layette Street, 4th Floor<br> New York, NY 10003</li>\n<li>The arbitration will be governed by the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.\nIf the AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration provider or the court will appoint a substitute.\nThe arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you are not a party.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its disclosure.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be maintained as confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either party\u2019s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality.\nEach party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that we will pay for your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your commercial claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nIf you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify us as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of any version of these Terms containing an arbitration provision.\nYour notice to us under this subsection must be submitted to the address above.</li>\n<li>All commercial claims between us, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be governed by New York law, excluding New York\u2019s conflict of laws rules, except to the extent that New York law is contrary to or preempted by federal law.\nIf a commercial claim between you and us is not subject to arbitration, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York or a state court located in New York, NY, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim.\nIf any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction.\nIf for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>GENERAL<ol>\n<li>If any provision of the Agreement is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make f enforceable and if such provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable nonetheless, the provision shall be deemed to be severable from the remainder of the Agreement and shall not cause the invalidity or unenforceability of the remainder of the Agreement.</li>\n<li>you acknowledge and agree that Yotpo has the right, at any time and for any reason, to redesign or modify the Yotpo Materials and other elements of the Platform or any part thereof.</li>\n<li>Prior notice of changes: Yotpo may update these Terms of Service from time to time by providing you with prior written notice of material updates at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date.\nNotice

be effective upon the effective date indicated at the top of these Terms of Service.\nThe updated version of these Terms will supersede all prior versions.\nYour acceptance: Following such notice,

using the Services.\nExceptions: Yotpo may not be able to provide at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of updates to these Terms that result from changes in the law or requirements from telecommunications providers.</li>\n<li>No failure, delay or default in performance of any obligation of a party (other than a payment obligation) shall constitute an event of default or breach of this Agreement to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil or military authority.\nfire.\nstrike, lockout or other labor dispute.\nflood, terrorist act.\nwar.\nriot.\ntheft.\nepidemic, pandemic or quarantine.\nearthquake, tornado or other natural disaster.\nfailure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services.\ndistributed denial of service (DDoS) or other cyberattacks.\nor refusal of a license by a government agency.\nThe party affected by such cause shall take all reasonable actions to minimize the consequences of any such cause.</li>\n<li>Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that either party may assign or transfer this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, to an affiliate or in connection with a sale or merger of all or substantially all of the assigning party\u2019s business or assets.\nAny unauthorized assignment will be void and of no force or effect.</li>\n<li>Except as expressly stated herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be considered as granting any rights to third parties.\nThe failure of either party to enforce any rights granted hereunder or to take action against the other party in the event of any breach hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver by that party as to subsequent enforcement of rights or subsequent actions in the event of future breaches.</li>\n<li>Yotpo may use subcontractors and permit them to exercise Yotpo\u2019s rights (including without limitation the provision of customer support), but Yotpo remains responsible for their compliance with this Agreement and for its overall performance under this Agreement.</li>\n<li>YOU AGREE THAT YOU MUST COMMENCE ANY CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST YOTPO ARISING OUT OF
