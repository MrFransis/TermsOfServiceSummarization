understanding the generally Accepted Technologies used in our collection of Anonymised Data include:-\n<br>\n2.4.1 \u201cIP Address\u201d refers to a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet.\nUnder certain circumstances, your IP Address remains the same from browser session to browser session.\nHowever, in the event that a consumer Internet access

Website.\n<br>\n2.4.2 \u201cCookies\u201d refer to small pieces of data that a website sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive or mobile device\u2019s internal storage while you are viewing the said

browses the internet, the end-user\u2019s presence generates a call for an advertisement as the publisher\u2019s site that the end-user is viewing will pass the IFA to the ad server and the advertiser is then able to serve the end-user with an advertisement relevant to the topic being viewed.\nIFA can also be used to identify whether the advertisements resulted in end-users downloading applications or purchasing products that were advertised.\nThe IFA does not identify the end-user personally, it provides an aggregated audience data that advertisers can target with advertisements.\nIFA can be opted out of via the settings in the end-user\u2019s device (by default, the IFA is enabled), subject to the availability of such options in the version of your operating system and the features of

potential legal action or claim against us, and as may be required or permitted by applicable laws (including laws pertaining to taxation and keeping of accounting records).\nAs soon as there is no more legitimate business or legal needs for us to retain and process your Personal Data, your Personal Data will be deleted or anonymised (where possible), and in the event that it is not possible
