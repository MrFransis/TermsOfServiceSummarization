written public comments made by SFDC regarding future functionality or features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2 Usage Limits.</strong> Services and Content are subject to usage limits specified in Order Forms and Documentation.\nIf Customer exceeds a contractual usage limit, SFDC may work with Customer to seek to reduce Customer\u2019s usage so that it conforms to that limit.\nIf, notwithstanding SFDC\u2019s efforts, Customer is unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, Customer will execute an Order Form for additional quantities of the applicable Services or Content promptly upon SFDC\u2019s request, and/or pay any invoice for excess usage in accordance with the \u201cInvoicing and Payment\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.3 Customer Responsibilities.</strong>

commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of Services and Content, and notify SFDC promptly of any such unauthorized access or use, (d) use Services and Content only in

or Users that in SFDC\u2019s judgment threatens the security, integrity or availability of SFDC\u2019s services, may result in SFDC\u2019s immediate suspension of the Services, however SFDC will use commercially reasonable efforts under the circumstances to provide Customer with notice and an opportunity to remedy such violation or threat prior to any such suspension.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.4 Usage

the Service, or (4) determine whether the Services are within the scope of any patent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.5 Removal of Content and Non-SFDC Applications.</strong> If Customer receives notice that Content or a Non-SFDC Application must be removed, modified and/or disabled to avoid violating applicable law, third-party rights, or the Acceptable Use and External Facing Services Policy, Customer will promptly do so.\nIf Customer does not take required action in accordance with the above, or if in SFDC\u2019s judgment continued violation is likely to reoccur, SFDC may disable the applicable Content, Service and/or Non-SFDC Application.\nIf requested by SFDC, Customer shall confirm such deletion and discontinuance of use in writing and SFDC shall be authorized to provide a copy of such confirmation to any such third party claimant or governmental authority, as applicable.\nIn addition, if SFDC is required by any third party rights holder to remove Content, or receives information that Content provided to Customer may violate applicable law or third-party rights, SFDC may discontinue Customer\u2019s access to Content through the Services.</p> 4.\nNON-SFDC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES <p>\n<strong>4.1 Non-SFDC Products and Services.</strong> SFDC or third parties may make available (for example, through a Marketplace or otherwise) third-party products or services, including, for example, Non-SFDC Applications and implementation and other consulting services.\nAny acquisition by Customer of such products or services, and any exchange of data between Customer and any Non-SFDC provider, product or service is solely between Customer and the applicable Non-SFDC provider.\nSFDC does not warrant or support Non-SFDC Applications or other Non-SFDC products or services, whether or not they are designated by SFDC as \u201ccertified\u201d or otherwise, unless expressly provided otherwise in an Order Form.\nSFDC is not responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by such Non-SFDC Application or its provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 Integration with Non-SFDC Applications.</strong> The Services may contain features designed to interoperate with Non-SFDC Applications.\nSFDC cannot guarantee the continued availability of such Service features, and may cease providing them without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation, if for example and without limitation, the provider of a Non-SFDC Application ceases to make the Non-SFDC Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Service features in a manner acceptable to SFDC.</p> 5.\nFEES AND PAYMENT <p>\n<strong>5.1 Fees.</strong> Customer will pay all fees specified in Order Forms.\nExcept as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) fees are based on Services and Content subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 Invoicing and Payment.</strong> Customer will provide SFDC with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to SFDC.\nIf Customer provides credit card information to SFDC, Customer authorizes SFDC to charge such credit card for all Purchased Services listed in the Order Form for the initial subscription term and any renewal subscription term(s) as set forth in the \u201cTerm of Purchased Subscriptions\u201d section below.\nSuch charges shall be made in advance, either annually or in accordance with any different billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form.\nIf the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, SFDC will invoice Customer in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form.\nUnless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced fees are due net 30 days from the invoice date.\nCustomer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to SFDC and notifying SFDC of any changes to such information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3 Overdue Charges.</strong> If any invoiced amount is not received by SFDC by the due date, then without limiting SFDC\u2019s rights or remedies, (a) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, and/or (b) SFDC may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those specified in the \u201cInvoicing and Payment\u201d section above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.4 Suspension of Service and Acceleration.</strong> If any charge owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for services is 30 days or more overdue, (or 10 or more days overdue in the case of amounts Customer has authorized SFDC to charge to Customer\u2019s credit card), SFDC may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer\u2019s unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full, provided that, other than for customers paying by credit card or direct debit whose payment has been declined, SFDC will give Customer at least 10 days\u2019 prior notice that its account is overdue, in accordance with the \u201cManner of Giving Notice\u201d section below for billing notices, before suspending services to Customer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.5 Payment Disputes.</strong> SFDC will not exercise its rights under the \u201cOverdue Charges\u201d or \u201cSuspension of Service and Acceleration\u201d section above if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.6 Taxes.</strong> SFDC's fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, \u201cTaxes\u201d).\nCustomer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder.\nIf SFDC has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, SFDC will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides SFDC with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\nFor clarity, SFDC is solely responsible for taxes assessable against it based on its income, property and employees.</p> 6.\nPROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES <p>\n<strong>6.1 Reservation of Rights.</strong> Subject to the limited rights expressly granted hereunder, SFDC, its Affiliates, its licensors and Content Providers reserve all of their right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all of their related intellectual property rights.\nNo rights are granted to Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2 Access to and Use of Content.</strong> Customer has the right to access and use applicable Content subject to the terms of applicable Order Forms, this Agreement and the Documentation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3 License by Customer to SFDC.</strong> Customer grants SFDC, its Affiliates and applicable contractors a worldwide, limited-term license to host, copy, use, transmit, and display any Non-SFDC Applications and program code created by or for Customer using a Service or for use by Customer with the Services, and Customer Data, each as appropriate for SFDC to provide and ensure proper operation of the Services and associated systems in accordance with this Agreement.\nIf Customer chooses to use a Non-SFDC Application with a Service, Customer grants SFDC permission to allow the Non-SFDC Application and its provider to access Customer Data and information about Customer\u2019s usage of the Non-SFDC Application as appropriate for the interoperation of that Non-SFDC Application with the Service.\nSubject to the limited licenses granted herein, SFDC acquires no right, title or interest from Customer or its licensors under this Agreement in or to any Customer Data, Non-SFDC Application or such program code.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4 License by Customer to Use Feedback.</strong> Customer grants to SFDC and its Affiliates a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into its services any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction or other feedback provided by Customer or Users relating to the operation of SFDC\u2019s or its Affiliates\u2019 services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5 Federal Government End Use Provisions.</strong> SFDC provides the Services, including related software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use in accordance with the following: The Services consist of \u201ccommercial items,\u201d as defined at FAR 2.101.\nIn accordance with FAR 12.211-12.212 and DFARS 227.7102-4 and 227.7202-4, as applicable, the rights of the U.S.\nGovernment to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose commercial computer software, commercial computer software documentation, and technical data furnished in connection with the Services shall be as provided in this Agreement, except that, for U.S.\nDepartment of Defense end users, technical data customarily provided to the public is furnished in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7015.\nIf a government agency needs additional rights, it must negotiate a mutually acceptable written addendum to this Agreement specifically granting those rights.</p> 7.\nCONFIDENTIALITY <p>\n<strong>7.1 Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all information disclosed by a party (\u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) to the other party (\u201cReceiving Party\u201d), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure.\nConfidential Information of Customer includes Customer Data.\nConfidential Information of SFDC includes the Services and Content, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms (including pricing).\nConfidential Information of each party includes business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by such party.\nHowever, Confidential Information does not include any information that (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, (iii) is received from a third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party, or (iv) was independently developed by the Receiving Party.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this \u201cConfidentiality\u201d section apply to Confidential Information exchanged between the parties in connection with the evaluation of additional SFDC services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.2 Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> As between the parties, each party retains all ownership rights in and to its Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to (i) not use any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement and (ii) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates\u2019 employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who have signed confidentiality agreements with the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein.\nNeither party will disclose the terms of this Agreement or any Order Form to any third party other than its Affiliates, legal counsel and accountants without the other party\u2019s prior written consent, provided that a party that makes any such disclosure to its Affiliate, legal counsel or accountants will remain responsible for such Affiliate\u2019s, legal counsel\u2019s or accountant\u2019s compliance with this \u201cConfidentiality\u201d section.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, SFDC may disclose the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Order Form to a subcontractor or Non-SFDC Application Provider to the extent necessary to perform SFDC\u2019s obligations under this Agreement, under terms of confidentiality materially as protective as set forth herein.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.3 Compelled Disclosure.</strong> The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.\nIf the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party\u2019s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.</p> 8.\nREPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND DISCLAIMERS <p>\n<strong>8.1 Representations.</strong> Each party represents that it has validly entered into this Agreement and has the legal power to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2 SFDC Warranties.</strong> SFDC warrants that during an applicable subscription term (a) this Agreement, the Order Forms and the Documentation will accurately describe the applicable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer Data, (b) SFDC will not materially decrease the overall security of the Services, (c) the Services will perform materially in accordance with the applicable Documentation, and (d) subject to the \u201cIntegration with Non-SFDC Applications\u201d section above, SFDC will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Services.\nFor any breach of a warranty above, Customer\u2019s exclusive remedies are those described in the \u201cTermination\u201d and \u201cRefund or Payment upon Termination\u201d sections below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3 Disclaimers.</strong> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, AND EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nCONTENT AND BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS,\u201d AND AS AVAILABLE EXCLUSIVE OF ANY WARRANTY WHATSOEVER.</p> 9.\nMUTUAL INDEMNIFICATION <p>\n<strong>9.1 Indemnification by SFDC.</strong> SFDC will defend Customer against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that any Purchased Service infringes or misappropriates such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights (a \u201cClaim Against <strong>Customer</strong>\u201d), and will indemnify Customer from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Customer as a result of, or for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement approved by SFDC in writing of, a Claim Against Customer, provided Customer (a) promptly gives SFDC written notice of the Claim Against Customer, (b) gives SFDC sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Customer (except that SFDC may not settle any Claim Against Customer unless it unconditionally releases Customer of all liability), and (c) gives SFDC all reasonable assistance, at SFDC\u2019s expense.\nIf SFDC receives information about an infringement or misappropriation claim related to a Service, SFDC may in its discretion and at no cost to Customer (i) modify the Services so that they are no longer claimed to infringe or misappropriate, without breaching SFDC\u2019s warranties under \u201cSFDC Warranties\u201d above, (ii) obtain a license for Customer\u2019s continued use of that Service in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate Customer\u2019s subscriptions for that Service upon 30 days\u2019 written notice and refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of the terminated subscriptions.\nThe above defense and indemnification obligations do not apply if (1) the allegation does not state with specificity that the Services are the basis of the Claim Against Customer.\n(2) a Claim Against Customer arises from the use or combination of the Services or any part thereof with software, hardware, data, or processes not provided by SFDC, if the Services or use thereof would not infringe without such combination.\n(3) a Claim Against Customer arises from Services under an Order Form for which there is no charge.\nor (4) a Claim against Customer arises from Content, a Non-SFDC Application or Customer\u2019s breach of this Agreement, the Documentation or applicable Order Forms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2 Indemnification by Customer.</strong> Customer will defend SFDC and its Affiliates against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against SFDC by a third party alleging (a) that any Customer Data or Customer\u2019s use of Customer Data with the Services, (b) a Non-SFDC Application provided by Customer, or (c) the combination of a Non-SFDC Application provided by Customer and used with the Services, infringes or misappropriates such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or arising from Customer\u2019s use of the Services or Content in an unlawful manner or in violation of the Agreement, the Documentation, or Order Form (each a \u201cClaim Against <strong>SFDC</strong>\u201d), and will indemnify SFDC from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against SFDC as a result of, or for any amounts paid by SFDC under a settlement approved by Customer in writing of, a Claim Against SFDC, provided SFDC (a) promptly gives Customer written notice of the Claim Against SFDC, (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against SFDC (except that Customer may not settle any Claim Against SFDC unless it unconditionally releases SFDC of all liability), and (c) gives Customer all reasonable assistance, at Customer\u2019s expense.\nThe above defense and indemnification obligations do not apply if a Claim Against SFDC arises from SFDC\u2019s breach of this Agreement, the Documentation or applicable Order Forms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3 Exclusive Remedy.</strong> This \u201cMutual Indemnification\u201d section states the indemnifying party\u2019s sole liability to, and the indemnified party\u2019s exclusive remedy against, the other party for any third party claim described in this section.</p> 10.\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY <p>\n<strong>10.1 Limitation of Liability.</strong> IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TOGETHER WITH ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER AND ITS AFFILIATES HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE.\nTHE FOREGOING LIMITATION WILL APPLY WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, BUT WILL NOT LIMIT CUSTOMER'S AND ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE \u201cFEES AND PAYMENT\u201d SECTION ABOVE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.2 Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages.</strong> IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, GOODWILL, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR IF A PARTY\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 REMEDY OTHERWISE FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.</p> 11.\nTERM AND TERMINATION <p>\n<strong>11.1 Term of Agreement.</strong> This Agreement commences on the date Customer first accepts it and continues until all subscriptions hereunder have expired or have been

subscriptions will be at SFDC\u2019s applicable list price in effect at the time of the applicable renewal.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary, any renewal in which subscription volume or

Termination.</strong> A party may terminate this Agreement for cause (i) upon 30 days written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such
