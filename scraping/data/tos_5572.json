Forum, SPN, and Portmaster update server: these\nservices collect different levels of data, however we aim to collect as\nlittle as possible, and all data received by us is treated with the\nstrictest of confidence with privacy always in mind, all data is held\nsecurely.</p> Article 2.\nPersonal Identifiable Information &amp.\nData we collect <p>Although the information collected is basic and may not be classed as PII, we treat all data with the same respect and as such have listed all the data we collect from the services we provide.</p> Websites and other Web Services <p>Safing operates these websites, hosted and managed by GitHub (Pages):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website: https://safing.io</li>\n<li>Documentation: https://docs.safing.io</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can read GitHub\u2019s privacy policy to see how they handle your data.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Safing additionally operates and manages the following websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Account Service: https://account.safing.io</li>\n<li>Account API Service: https://api.account.safing.io</li>\n<li>Asset Server: https://assets.safing.io</li>\n<li>Update Server: https://updates.safing.io</li>\n<li>Support Server: https://support.safing.io</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The following personal identifiable information (PII) is held for technical reasons and is deleted after 72 hours:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP Address</li>\n<li>User Agent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is how the 72 hours are broken up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 24 hours until the raw logs are processed.</li>\n<li>Another 24 hours for processing in technical and operational systems.</li>\n<li>Another 24 hours for guaranteed full deletion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While 72 hours is the maximum holding time period we guarantee, the time to deletion is usually a lot shorter.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Independently from this process, we always reduce PII as early as possible to reduce the time it is held and also reduce the number of systems the information is exposed to in the first place.\nIn some cases we even manage to delete IP addresses within an hour.</p> Your Account <p>If you register for and use an account on https://account.safing.io, we additionally collect this information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User name, supplied by you, not your real name.</li>\n<li>Email address, required for some payment methods, our contact with you for account related information.</li>\n<li>Country, and country calling code, required for Austrian taxation law.</li>\n<li>Transaction identifiers necessary for processing, supplied to us by third party payment providers.</li>\n<li>Password, always stored in an encrypted (hashed) form.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This service also includes the domain https://api.account.safing.io, which hosts the API that the Portmaster interacts with.</p> The Portmaster Software <p>The Portmaster software runs locally on your device and monitors your network traffic in order to block unwanted connections.\nWhile it handles a lot of PII internally, at no point does the Portmaster software share any PII with us or anyone else, with the exception of the following cases:</p>\n<p>The Portmaster interacts with the following <strong>Web Services by Safing</strong>: https://updates.safing.io, https://support.safing.io, https://account.safing.io, https://api.account.safing.io<br>\nPlease refer to the previous sections to learn about these services.</p>\n<p>If you choose to report an issue or give feedback via the <strong>support system</strong> within the Portmaster software, it sends your request with all its attached data to https://support.safing.io, which then forwards it to your chosen support channel.</p>\n<p>If you use the <strong>Safing Privacy Network (SPN)</strong> module of the Portmaster, it supplies the username and password you enter to https://api.account.safing.io in order to log in.\nThese credentials are not provided to any server in the SPN, but an authorization token is used instead.\nIn the network itself, only the initial server knows and handles your IP address, which is never logged.</p>\n<p>Please note that not all servers in the SPN are operated by Safing.\nIf the Portmaster makes use of <strong>servers that are operated by the community</strong> (ie.\na third party), we cannot guarantee how your information is handled by these operators.\nWhile we need to make you aware of this policy-wise, there is no privacy risk associated with this, as the SPN is built to protect your privacy in exactly this case and every server only receives minimal and only parts of the connection data, so that no server can both identify you and identify what you do online.</p>\n<p>As the Portmaster is also a <strong>DNS Client</strong>, it sends DNS queries to the configured DNS Providers.<br>\nWhen you start using or configuring the Portmaster, please read the privacy policy of the configured DNS Providers.</p> Customer Support <p>Safing ICS Technologies GmbH run customer support services for its users, customer support covers all aspects of\nthe services provided, including and not limited to: accounts, Portmaster, SPN, general enquiries and
