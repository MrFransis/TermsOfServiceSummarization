features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the website or online service that a user visits, indicating that the user does not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not yet a common, global understanding of how to interpret Do Not Track signals, Alibaba does not currently respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Contact Us</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this
