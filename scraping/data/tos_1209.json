<p>\n<strong>Last updated: January 7, 2019.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Ryver LLC, a Delaware corporation (\u201cRyver\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) is committed to the protection of your privacy.\nWe have established this privacy statement (the \u2018Statement\u2019) as a means of disclosing to you how we collect, utilize, distribute, and protect your personal information.\nThis privacy statement covers both the Site www.ryver.com (the \u201cSite\u201d) and the services and applications (the \u201cService\u201d) that Ryver LLC provides.\nFor the purposes of this Privacy Statement, \u201ccustomer\u201d shall mean any past, current, or prospective customer of Ryver, including any visitor to the Site.\nThis Privacy Statement governs the manner in which Ryver collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from customers in connection with Ryver\u2019s Site, services, and applications.\nRyver is committed to safeguarding the information its customers entrust to it.\nCapitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Service.\nBy accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Statement.</p>\nCollecting and Using Information\n<p>Ryver uses information we collect to operate, maintain, and provide you the features and functionality of the Service, to analyze how the Service is used, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain security, personalize content, remember information to help you efficiently access your account, monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns, and track Content and users as necessary to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Organization Owners:</b> When a person signs up for a new Ryver organization, they are the Owner, or Primary Administrator, of that organization.\nAs an Organization Owner, we may send you service, technical, and other administrative emails, messages, and other types of communications &nbsp;in lieu of communication by postal mail.\nWe may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices.\nIn addition, we may need to contact you for invoicing, account management, and similar reasons, and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.\nThese communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them.\nFinally, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications, or other news about Ryver, which you can opt out of receiving by unsubscribing via a link provided in the email or by writing to us at privacy@ryver.com.</p>\n<p>\n<b>User Profiles:</b> When a Member or Guest is invited to a Ryver organization, they fill out a user profile, which includes an email address, display name, and other optional information.\nRyver will use the email address for directly providing application services such as offline notifications.\nAdditionally, we may use the email address to send tips on using the product.\nYou can opt out of receiving these emails by unsubscribing via a link provided in the email or by writing to us at privacy@ryver.com.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Error Log Data:</b> If you encounter an error in the Ryver application, we will provide a feedback form so you can report the problem to our customer support.\nThe error report includes the operating system, browser, device information, and records the action that was being performed at the time the error occurred.\nThis information is used to help diagnose and solve the customer problem.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Third Party Service Integration:</b> Ryver connects to third party services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, to facilitate document attachments and Google Hangout integration.\nRyver connects to these services via OAuth, and does not directly capture or store your username or password for these external services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ryver Usage Metrics:</b> Ryver tracks application usage and stores it in a metrics database, from which we create charts and spreadsheets for analysis, allowing us to understand what parts of the Ryver service are and are not being used, and to what extent.\nData tracked includes number of invites, number of teams created, number of chat messages, posts and comments, etc.\nThis data does NOT include actual content such as team names, message content, or user names.</p>\nContent\n<p>\n<b>Your Content:</b> When you post content into Ryver, that content is private to you and the other users in your Ryver organization.\nWho exactly can see what content depends on the configuration of the teams and users in your organization.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ryver Employees:</b> We have taken steps at Ryver to ensure that your content remains private.\nWhile we are a technology company providing a service, and certain employees need to have access to customer data stores, we minimize that access, even amongst the engineering staff.\nBy taking advantage of Amazon\u2019s Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration (https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), we ensure that most of the Ryver employees are unable to access customer content data stores.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Disclosure:</b> As outlined in section 5 (Acceptable User of Ryver) in the Ryver Terms of Service, there may be certain cases where Ryver is required to access, remove, preserve, or disclose information as necessary to comply with legal obligations and/or protect our users.\nAs long as we are legally permitted, we will provide notice of any situation where accessing content becomes necessary.\nWe will also request permission before accessing content to provide customer support.</p>\nCookies and Log Files\n<p>When you use the Service, we may send one or more \u201ccookies\u201d (a small data file) to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and assist Ryver to help you log in faster and improve your navigation through the Site.\nA cookie may convey anonymous information to us about how you browse the Service.\nA persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site.\nPersistent cookies can be removed by following your browser\u2019s directions.\nA session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.\nYou can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, certain features of the Service may not function properly if you disable the ability to accept cookies.</p>\nDevice Identifiers and Geo-Location Information\n<p>Ryver does not currently collect precise GPS information with our mobile client.\nShould that change in the future, we will update our privacy policy, and take steps in the application to ensure that users are aware of such use of location information in order to provide our service.\nShould we add such a feature in the future, please note that a device identifier or location data does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.</p>\nThird Party Analytics\n<p>Ryver may use third party analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to help understand use of the Service or the Ryver web site.\nMany of these tools collect the information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including cookies, and your IP address.\nThese analytics tools also receive this information and their use of it is governed by their privacy policy or statement.</p>\nThird Party Website Remarketing\n<p>The Ryver web site may use third-party remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google, Facebook, and Twitter) to previous visitors to our site.\nThese 3rd party sites use tracking cookies to serve ads based on someone\u2019s past visits to our website.\nThis means we might continue to show ads to you across the Internet, specifically on the Google Content Network (GCN), Facebook, and Twitter.\nAs always, we respect your privacy, and we are not collecting any personally identifiable information through the use of Google\u2019s, Facebook\u2019s, Twitter\u2019s, or any other 3rd party remarketing system.\nYou can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page (http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/).\nIf you do not want Twitter to match your account to information shared by ad partners to tailor ads for you, you can uncheck the box next to \u201cPromoted content\u201d in your account settings at any time.\n(Read More (https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170405) for details.) And, you can set preferences for how Facebook advertises to you by editing your privacy settings (https://www.facebook.com/help/155389304528852) on Facebook.</p>\nProtecting Information\n<p>Ryver makes diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our customers.\nRyver has put stringent security procedures in place to protect such information collected about our customers.\nWe constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures.\nSecure Sockets Layer (\u201cSSL\u201d) connections are used to communicate to our system to protect customer information as well as encrypting vital information that customers input through the Site.\nWhile Ryver cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be 100% secure, we take security very seriously and follow industry best practices.\nWe have also paid for third party security audits in the past, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>\nAccess to your personal data\n<p>We will display your personal identifiable information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set for your user account.\nAny information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you.\nPlease carefully consider what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity.\nYou can review and revise your profile information at any time by going to <b>\n<i>My Settings &gt.\nProfile</i>\n</b>.\nWe may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example, if you use a third party application to access your account (see below).\nIf you want to have your profile information completely removed (for example, after you leave a Ryver organization), please contact privacyshield@ryver.com and we will delete your personal information completely from our system.</p>\nService Providers and Third Party Services\n<p>Ryver may share your personally identifiable information or certain content with other third parties for the purpose of providing the Service to you.\nIf we do this, such third parties\u2019 use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Statement.</p>\n<p>Ryver may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example, when you choose to access our Service through such an application, and you provide that application with your Ryver login credentials.\nRyver is not responsible for what those third parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy or statement acceptable to you.</p>\nBusiness Transfers\n<p>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings.\nCustomers, email, and visitor information is generally one of the business assets transferred in these types of transactions.\nWe may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, consolidations, mergers, or dissolution.</p>\nCompliance with laws, law enforcement requests, and protection of Ryver\n<p>Ryver may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law, law enforcement, or subpoena.\nRyver may disclose your personal information if Ryver believes that it is reasonably necessary in order (i) to comply with law, regulation, or legal request.\n(ii) to protect the safety of any person.\n(iii) to address fraud, security, or technical issues.\nor (iv) to protect Ryver\u2019s rights or property.</p>\nChildren\u2019s Privacy\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\nOur Service is not directed to persons under 13.\nRyver does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register with the Service.\nIf we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.\nIf you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at feedback@ryver.com.</p>\nEU-US Privacy Shield Framework\n<p>Ryver complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States, respectively.\nRyver has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.\n</p>\n<p>Ryver is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with regard to the Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>\nEU-US Privacy Complaints\n<p>In compliance with the US-EU Privacy Shield Principles, Ryver commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.\nEuropean Union individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should&nbsp;first contact Jeff Hershauer at Ryver at privacyshield@ryver.com, or by mail at Ryver LLC, 9035 East Pima Center Parkway, Suite 5, Scottsdale, AZ 85258

European country that\u2019s part of Privacy Shield and are not satisfied by our response to your grievance, you can seek independent recourse mechanism with EU Data Protection Authorities (DPA).</p>\n<p>Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield

POLICY\n<p>\n<strong>6.1 Payment Terms</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When upgrading from the free Ryver Team Communication service to one of the premium services such as Team Task Manager, fees are specified in the \u201cUpgrade\u201d form, and must be paid in advance.\nPayments and Payment Obligations for services are non-refundable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2 Cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you cancel your service in the middle of a period that has already been paid for, you will continue to have access to that service for the remainder of the subscription period.\nFees are stated exclusive of any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3 Subscription Renewal</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subscriptions will be automatically renewed at the interval determined at time of purchase (monthly/yearly).\nFailure to process the credit card on file will result in multiple retries over a seven day period, during which the paid service will continue to be available.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4 Unpaid Subscriptions</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>After 7 days, the account will be considered unpaid, and the customer may be downgraded to the free service level.\nPlease note that if this happens and you lose access to your team tasks, the data will remain and be available upon payment and resuming of the premium tier service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5 Downgrades and Customer Credit</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is possible to \u201cdowngrade\u201d from a higher cost plan to a lower cost plan, or from a yearly payment to monthly.\nIf you do choose to move to a lower cost plan, resulting in credit for unused time on your higher cost plan, you will see that in your invoices as a negative total for your invoice services.</li>\n<li>You will not receive a refund on the remaining credit.\nRather, future subscription payments will be pulled from your available credit until it is necessary to charge your credit card again.</li>\n</ul>\n7.0 PRIVACY\n<p>\n<strong>7.1</strong> We care about the privacy of our users.\nWe collect, use and share
