THE SERVICES<p>\n<b>A.\nAccessing the Services and Becoming a Member.</b>\n</p>\n<p>THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED SOLELY FOR ACCESS AND USE BY INDIVIDUALS 18 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER.\nBY ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE CERTIFYING THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD.\nOur Services are primarily intended to be utilized by residents of the United States and we may limit or restrict access to the Websites and Services based on your geographic location or ISP.\nWhile there are parts of the Services where access requires the payment of a fee (\u201dPaid Services\u201d), there is no cost to register to become a member of the Services.\nThe specific Services available to you will vary depending upon (1) whether you register as a member, (2) the community affiliation(s) to which you have self-identified (if you are a Classmates member), and (3) whether or not you choose to purchase Paid Services.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>B.\nYour Information.</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will collect, store, compile and utilize information about you, your computer, smartphone or other device, and your use of the Services, including information that you provide in response to questionnaires, surveys and registration forms.\nPlease review our Privacy Policy for more information about our privacy policies and practices.\nFor your part, you agree that all information that you provide to us or post on the Services is complete, accurate and up to date.\nIf any of your information changes, you agree to immediately update it.\nIf you fail to update your information or if all or part of your information is (or appears to be) untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services, without refund to you of any fees paid.</p>\n<p>Without limiting any of the foregoing, you are responsible for ensuring that the email address you provide to us is valid and that the services, software or systems you use to access your email (\"Email Systems\") do not block or filter Communications (as defined below).\nWe ask that you use your personal email address when registering.\nIf you provide us with a non-personal email address or use an Email System that interferes with the delivery of Communications, we may not be able to provide you with certain Services.\nYour failure to provide us with an email address to which we can consistently deliver email may result in the termination of your account.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>C.\nYour Password.</b>\n</p>\n<p>During the registration process we may provide you with a unique registration number.\nWe will also either ask you to create a password or assign you a random password, which you can change at any time by logging onto the \"Account\" portion of the Services.\nAlternatively, you may have the option of using your Facebook login credentials or similar login processes or co-registration forms from or on other third party websites to create an account and authenticate your access to the website.\nBecause any activities that occur under your account are your responsibility, it is important for you to keep your password secure.\nNotify us immediately if you believe that someone has used your account without your authorization.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>D.\nCommunications.</b>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time we will send you communications, in keeping with our Privacy Policy and as otherwise permitted in these Terms of Service (\"Communications\").\nPlease note that any number of issues may interfere with your receipt of such Communications, including some types of Email Systems that may use filtering or blocking techniques that are intended to block email.\nWe are not responsible for the actual delivery or your actual receipt of these Communications.</p>\n<p>\n</p>2.\nPAID SERVICES<p>Access to some of the Services requires the purchase of Paid Services.\nIf you elect to purchase Paid Services, you agree to our storage of your payment information and understand that your Paid Services are personal to you, such that you may not transfer or make available your account name and password to others.\nAny distribution or sharing by you of your account name and password may result in cancellation of your Paid Services without refund and/or additional charges based on unauthorized use.\nWe reserve the right, from time to time, to change the Paid Services, with or without prior notice to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>A.\nPayment.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Prices for all Paid Services are in U.S.\ndollars and exclude any and all applicable taxes, unless expressly stated otherwise.\nTo the extent permissible under law, you are responsible for any applicable taxes, whether or not they are listed on your receipt or statement.\nAll applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase.\nIf you purchase Paid Services, you agree to pay, using a valid credit or debit card or other form of payment that we may accept from time to time (\u201cPayment Method\u201d), the applicable fees and taxes (if any) set forth in the offer that you accepted.\nWe reserve the right, upon prior notice to you, to change the amount of any fees and to institute new fees, effective at the end of your current subscription period.\nAll authorized charges will be billed to your designated Payment Method on the terms described in the specific offer.\nIf payment cannot be charged to your Payment Method or your payment is returned to us for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to the unpaid-for Paid Services.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that sufficient funds are available to cover the charges for the Paid Services, and we have no liability for any overdraft or other fees that you may incur as a result of our processing of your payment.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>B.\nAutomatic Renewal Program.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Upon your acceptance of an offer for the purchase of any subscription-based Paid Services, you will be enrolled in our automatic renewal program to help ensure that there is no interruption in your access to such Paid Services.\nUnder this program, you authorize us to automatically renew your subscription at the end of the term of the subscription you purchased, and each subsequent term, for the same term length of the subscription you initially purchased (unless otherwise stated in the offer you accepted).\nUnless you change your renewal status as described below, at the time of each such renewal you authorize us to charge your designated Payment Method at the then-current, non-promotional price (unless otherwise stated in the offer you accepted) for the renewal of your subscription.\nIf you no longer want to be enrolled in our automatic renewal program, you can change your renewal status at any time by completing the following steps:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classmates.com - logging onto the Account portion of the Classmates.com Website, clicking on \"Account &amp.\nBilling\" and changing your renewal option from \"automatic\" to \"manual.\"</li>\n<li>Intelius.com \u2013 logging onto the My Account portion of the Intelius.com Website and click on \u201ccancel my membership.\u201d</li>\n<li>USSearch.com - logging onto the Your Account portion of the USSearch.com Website and click on \u201ccancel service.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that completing these steps will only stop future automatic renewals of your current subscription and will not impact any automatic renewals that occurred prior to the date that you completed these steps.</p>\n<p>\n<b>C.\nCurrent Information.</b>\n</p>\n<p>You must provide us with current, complete and accurate information for your Payment Method.\nYou must promptly update all information to keep your Payment Method current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, card number or expiration date), and you must promptly notify us if your Payment Method is cancelled (including if you lose your card or it is stolen), or if you become aware of a potential breach of security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your name or password).\nChanges to such information can be made by accessing the Account portion of the applicable Website or by contacting the applicable Customer Support.\nIf you fail to provide us with any of the foregoing information, you agree that you are responsible for fees accrued under your Payment Method.\nIn addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as allowed or provided by your credit or debit card issuer.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>D.\nNo Refund Policy.</b>\n</p>\n<p>All fees relating to Paid Services, including the initial fees and any subsequent automatic renewal fees (as described above), are non-refundable.\nIf you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, we may in our discretion cancel your Paid Services immediately.\nIf we successfully dispute the reversal, and the reversed funds are returned to us, you are not entitled to a refund or to have your Paid Services reinstated.</p>\n<p>\n</p>3.\nSPECIAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO CLASSMATES USERS<p>\n<b>A.\nClassmates Member Conduct - Community Guidelines.</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Classmates Services contain areas that enable members to communicate and share information, including without limitation sending email through the Services, providing information on your profile pages, and posting information on message boards, forums and other areas where you may interact with other members (collectively, the \"Communication Tools\").\nWhen you use the Communication Tools, you may have the opportunity to disclose, post, upload, or otherwise publicly display, or to share directly with other members, information and other content, including without limitation biographical information, photographs, stories and comments (collectively, \"Content\").\nWhile we may provide you with these Communications Tools, we also wish to remind you that you should choose carefully what information you post via the Services and share with other members.</p>\n<p>You are required to use the Communication Tools responsibly, just as you would act responsibly when communicating or interacting with others in your offline communities.\nAs a result, we expect and require that you take full responsibility for the Content that you post on or send through the Classmates Services.\nWe have established some \"Community Standards\" that outline your responsibilities when using the Communication Tools.</p>\n<p>The following Classmates Community Standards apply to and govern your use

the Communication Tools or the Content that is provided through such Communication Tools, nor are we obligated to do so.\nAccordingly, we do not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of the Content.\nBecause individuals sometimes choose not to comply with our policies and practices, you may be exposed to Content that you find offensive or otherwise objectionable.\nWe encourage you to use the tools available on the Classmates Services to report any Content that you think may violate the Community Standards.\nWe may investigate the complaints that come to our attention, but are not obligated to do so.\nIf we choose to investigate, we will take any action that we believe is appropriate in our sole discretion, such as issuing warnings, removing the Content, or suspending or terminating accounts.\nHowever, because situations and interpretations vary, we also reserve the right not to take any action.\nIn such cases, we may not remove Content that you believe is objectionable.\nPlease remember that you can always choose to refrain from using any part of the Services that exposes you to something that you are uncomfortable with.\nUnder no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any Content, including any errors or omissions in any Content or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of, access to or denial of access to any Content.\nIn addition, we are not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any user of the Website or member of these Services.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>C.\nSubmitting or Posting Content on Classmates.</b>\n</p>\n<p>We do not claim ownership of any of the Content you submit or post through the Classmates Services or allow us to obtain from third parties to include in the Services.\nInstead, you hereby grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, publish, store, distribute, display, communicate, perform, transmit, create derivative works based upon, and promote such Content (in whole or in part) in any medium now known or hereafter devised.\nPlease remember that you are ultimately responsible for all

(each, an \"Indemnified Party\") from and against any and all claims, proceedings, damages, injuries, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, an allocation for in-house counsel, and other legal costs) arising out of your acts or omissions, including claims resulting from your use of the Services, your submission, posting or transmission of information or

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\nYOU AND THE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES EACH AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT HAVE ARISEN OR MAY ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND THE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY.</b>\n</p>\n<p>You and PeopleConnect and/or its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, and/or any and all of their respective directors, officers, employees and contractors (each a \u201cPeopleConnect Entity\u201d and, together, the \u201cPeopleConnect Entities\u201d) agree to arbitrate any and all disputes and claims between them (\"Dispute(s)\"), except as otherwise specifically provided below.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.</p>\n<p>This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to: (1) Disputes related in any way to the Services, billing, privacy, advertising or our communications with you.\n(2) Disputes arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\n(3) Disputes that arose before your agreement to these Terms of Services or any prior agreement.\n(4) Disputes that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand (5) Disputes that may arise after the termination of your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>A.\nCONTACT US FIRST.</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you intend to pursue or participate in any Dispute in arbitration or small claims court (solely to the extent specifically provided below), you must first notify us of the dispute in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance of initiating arbitration or the small claims court action (if applicable) and attempt to informally negotiate a resolution to the Dispute in good faith.\nNotice to us should be sent via certified mail to: PeopleConnect, Inc., 1501 4th Avenue, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98101, Attention: Legal Department.\nThe notice of Dispute must: (a) include your name, address, phone number, and email address(es) used to register with or use the Services.\n(b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute.\n(c) enclose and/or identify all relevant documents and/or information.\nand (d) set forth the specific relief sought.\nIf the applicable PeopleConnect Entity and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the notice is received, you may commence with a formal arbitration proceeding or small claims court action (if applicable).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>B.\nMANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION, YOU AND THE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nTHE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT GOVERNS THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Rules.</b> The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), if applicable, as modified by this section.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules and a form for initiating the proceeding are available at www.adr.orgor by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.\nThe arbitration will be presided over by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA rules.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Location.</b> Unless otherwise required by the AAA rules, the arbitration shall be held in Seattle, Washington.\nYou and PeopleConnect may elect to have the arbitration conducted based solely on written submissions, subject to the arbitrator\u2019s discretion to require an in-person hearing.\nIn cases where an in-person hearing is held, you or the applicable PeopleConnect Entity may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cost Sharing.</b> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules, unless otherwise stated in this agreement.\nThe applicable PeopleConnect Entity will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, unless the arbitrator determines that a Dispute was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.\nReasonable documented attorneys' fees of both parties will be borne by the party that ultimately loses.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Arbitrator\u2019s Decision.</b> The arbitrator will decide the substance of the Dispute in accordance with the laws of the state of Washington, regardless of choice of law principles, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator will have the power to award a party any relief or remedy that the party could have received in court in accordance with the law(s) that apply to the Dispute.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>C.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>ANY PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nNEITHER PARTY SHALL BE A MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE OR CLAIM.\nUNLESS THE PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S DISPUTES, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nTHE PEOPLECONNECT ENTITIES DO NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION.\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>D.\nARBITRATION OPT-OUT.</b> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by this arbitration provision by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: PeopleConnect Arbitration Opt-Out, 1501 Fourth Avenue, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98101.\nThis notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Services or, if you are already a user of the Services upon initial release of this arbitration provision, within thirty (30) days of our email notice to you of that initial release.</p>\n<p>The opt-out notice must state that you do not agree to this agreement to arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number and email address(es) used to register with or use the Services.\nYou must sign the opt-out notice for it be effective.\nAny opt-out not received within the applicable thirty (30) day period set forth above will not be valid.</p>\n<p>If you opt-out of the agreement to arbitrate, you and the PeopleConnect Entities agree that any Disputes will be resolved by a state or federal court located in King County, Washington, and you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of such court.</p>\n<p>\n<b>E.\nSMALL CLAIMS.</b> You may choose to pursue your Dispute in small claims court (rather than arbitration) where jurisdiction and venue over the applicable PeopleConnect Entity and you are proper, and where your claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief, and so long as the matter advances on an individual (non-class) basis.</p>\n<p>\n<b>F.\nINJUNCTIVE RELIEF.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, either party may bring suit in court seeking a temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, which shall then be subject to review by the arbitrator should such party further seek permanent injunctive relief in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>G.\nTIME LIMIT TO PURSUE DISPUTE.</b> You agree that regardless of any statue or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>\n<p>\n<b>H.\nCHANGES TO ARBITRATION CLAUSE.</b> We may make changes to this arbitration provision during the term of our Services to you.\nYou may reject any material changes by sending us written objection within thirty (30) days of the change to PeopleConnect, Inc., 1501 Fourth Avenue, Suite 400, Seattle, WA 98101, Attention: Legal Department.\nBy rejecting any future material change, you are agreeing to arbitrate in accordance with the unmodified language of the previous version.</p>14.\nMISCELLANEOUS TERMS<p>Our relationship is not one of agency or partnership and neither you nor we shall be deemed to be a partner, employee, fiduciary, agent or representative of the other by your use of the Services.\nYou may not assign or transfer your rights to any third party.\nThe terms and conditions in these Terms of Service are severable.\nIn the event that any provision is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall still be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other provisions.\nIf we fail to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service it shall not constitute a waiver of such provision.\nWe may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms of Service.\nThese Terms of Service will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and licensees.\nThe failure of either party to insist upon or enforce the strict performance of the other party with respect to any provision of these Terms of Service, or to exercise any right thereunder, will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such party's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.\nrather, the same will be and will remain in full force and effect.\nThe Terms of Service, the&nbsp;Privacy Policy, and any additional terms incorporated by reference herein will be governed by the laws of the state of Washington and constitute the entire understanding between us regarding your access to, license and use of the Services and supersede any prior agreements, statements or representations with respect to the same.</p>", "created_at": "2021-05-17 04:17:05.925043", "updated_at": "2021-05-17 02:19:23.352235"}, {"id": 6042, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url":

Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we don't own or control or to people that we don't employ or manage.\nWe encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website and service that collects personal information about you.\nThis Privacy Policy applies solely to information that we collect from you as a user of the Services or about you from various third-party sources.\nThis Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service.\nEach time you use the Services, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.\nIf you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Services and terminate your membership or account.</p>1.\nCOLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION<p>a.\nWhen You Register</p>\n<p>When you register for the Services, you may be required to provide certain information, such as your name, maiden name (if applicable), mailing address and/or zip code, email address, phone number, birth date or year, marital status, password, and, in the case of the Classmates Services, one or more community affiliations (such as a school).\nYou may also be presented with the option to register for the Services using your Facebook login credentials or similar login processes or co-registration forms from or on other third-party websites, in which case you will be authorizing us to access certain information from your current profile on Facebook or other third-party website (which will be specified in such login process) for purposes of completing your registration.\nIn addition, when you install certain of our applications on Facebook or other third-party websites or devices, you will also be registering for the Services by agreeing to such installation, which takes place when you \"accept,\" \"install\" or \"allow\" (or similar language) such application.\nEach such application includes a disclosure that this registration will occur upon the acceptance, installation or allowance of the application.</p>\n<p>For Classmates members, please keep in mind that, although much of the information described above will not be viewable by other members, once you are registered your name, community affiliations and years associated with those affiliations will be displayed on the Classmates.com Website and you will no longer be anonymous to us or to other individuals who access this Website.\nIn addition, because this information is publicly displayed on this Website, it may be included in this Website\u2019s \"search\" tools, on our other Websites as described in Section 2(b) and on third-party websites and devices as described in Section 2(h) below.\nWe may also publicly display your general geographic location based upon the zip code or other geographical information provided to us, as another means of assisting members in finding each other.\nHowever, you have the option of opting out of having your general geographic location publicly displayed by accessing your privacy settings on this Website and changing your preferences.\nIn addition, some of the Classmates Services may only be accessible if, based on information you have provided to us, you have an affiliation related to these Services.</p>\n<p>b.\nWhen You Accept an Application</p>\n<p>Some third-party websites, such as Facebook, provide their users with access to applications or other tools, such as \"social login,\" which allow that website's users to share certain personal information with us.\nWhen you accept or allow one of our applications or use another tool to create a connection between us and Facebook or other third-party website, you authorize us to collect, store and use (in accordance with this Privacy Policy) all information that you agreed Facebook or other third-party website could provide to us, which may include such things as your email address, birthday, profile and other photos, school and work affiliations, location, interests, activities and friend information.\nThis authorization may also include the ability to continue to collect such information from Facebook or other third-party website on an ongoing basis.\nIf you choose to remove or delete any such application, or otherwise break our connection with your account on Facebook or other third-party website, we will no longer be able to continue to collect your information from that website.\nHowever, deletion or removal of such application does not delete your account from the applicable Website, and we will continue to store and use information that we have previously collected.\nYou can of course edit or delete any of your account information on the applicable Website at any time (see Section 3 below).</p>\n<p>Acceptance of one of our applications may authorize us to automatically post information to your profile on Facebook or other third-party website about certain of your activities, such as looking at a reunion, liking a photo, joining a community affiliation, viewing a yearbook, tagging someone in a yearbook, becoming a reunion organizer, updating the details of a reunion, responding to a reunion invitation or tagging someone as \"remembered.\" We may also provide you with the option to post additional information about your activities or information you have found through the Services to your profile on Facebook or other third-party website.</p>\n<p>c.\nWhen You Provide a Testimonial</p>\n<p>We display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our Websites, marketing materials and in other places, in addition to other endorsements.\nWe may post your testimonial along with your name and geographical information.\nIf you wish to update or delete your testimonial associated with any of our Websites, please contact Customer Support through the applicable Website.</p>\n<p>d.\nWhen You Use the Services</p>\n<p>Log Files</p>\n<p>As is the case with most standard website servers, we use and maintain the information that we obtain from and through your browser on our server logs.\nThis information can include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (\"ISP\"), and other data.\nWe may use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track user movement, detect fraud or other types of abuse, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.\nWe may associate this information with your information to resolve technical issues, support security for our users, and take action on any activity that may violate this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>Cookies</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from an email or a website's computers and stored in a browser-related file on your computer or other device.\nCookies are uniquely assigned to your computer or device, and are read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\nWe link cookies to your unique registration number and use them to enhance and personalize your experience on the Services, including helping authenticate you when you use the Services, remembering your preferences and registration information, and customizing the content and advertisements provided to you via the Services.\nFor example, storing a cookie on your computer or device allows you to login without typing the registered email address or registration number and password.\nWe also use cookies to deliver information and content specific to your interests through the Services.\nWe, our affiliates and brands, and our third-party advertising partners may also use cookies to target advertisements that you may view when visiting other websites.\nIf you do not want these cookies stored on your computer or device you can delete and/or reject cookies by modifying your Internet browser setting accordingly (each browser is different, so check the \"Help\" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences).\nHowever, if you choose to delete and/or reject cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use certain portions of the Services.\nPlease also note that certain types of emails available through the Services may automatically log you into the Services and/or set new cookies when you click on the links in the emails and that you may need to manually remove such cookies if you do not want them to be stored on your computer or device.\nSee Section 2(d) below for additional information about cookies in regards to our relationships with third parties.\nWe do not respond to or honor Do Not Track (DNT) signals.</p>\n<p>Web Beacons</p>\n<p>A web beacon (also known as a clear gif) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier that is placed on a web page or within an email.\nIt is similar in function to a cookie, and is used to collect a limited set of information, such as a cookie number, time and date of page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.\nWe, our affiliates and brands, and our third-party advertising partners may use web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users responded to them.\nThis information helps us better manage content available on the Services by informing us about what content is effective and of interest to users.\nIn addition, we may use web beacons in our promotional email messages to keep track of how many messages and which emails have been opened and acted upon.\nThis use allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and our marketing campaigns.\nWe associate web beacons with individual members for internal purposes only, in an effort to understand our members' individual preferences with our email products.</p>\n<p>Local Shared Objects</p>\n<p>We use Local Shared Objects, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.\nThird parties with which we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use Flash cookies or HTML5 to collect and store information.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\nTo manage Flash cookies, please click here.</p>\n<p>e.\nWhen You Purchase a Product or Paid Services from Us</p>\n<p>If you choose to purchase a product or paid Services from us, you may be required to provide us with certain personal contact information, such as your name, email address and billing address.\nWe may also require other information necessary for you to receive the product, access the paid Services and/or process any applicable payment, such as a credit card or debit card number, card security code and expiration date.\nWe may use the information that you provide to us to bill you for products and paid Services you request, or to notify you of additional products and paid Services we may offer.\nWhen you sign-up for a product or paid Services, you are consenting to our delivery of this information to our service providers, which may include banks and credit card companies that we use to process a transaction or other third parties who may provide all or a portion of the underlying product or paid Services on our behalf.\nSee Section 2(e) below for additional information about sharing your information with our service providers.\nFor Classmates members, we may also show your membership status through the Services so that other members can see what options they have to contact or communicate with you.</p>\n<p>f.\nWhen You Use Classmates Member-to-Member Communications</p>\n<p>The Classmates Services use a \"double-blind\" email system, which hides the email addresses to protect the privacy of both the sender and receiver when a member sends another member an email through these Services.\nWhen using these member-to-member communications, it is up to you to choose when you are comfortable disclosing your email address, or any other personal contact information, to others.\nWe respect the privacy of these member-to-member communications and do not read or disclose them unless we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy and/or our Terms of Service, or as otherwise permitted or required under Section 2(g) below.\nPlease keep in mind that you will not be able to delete, revise or otherwise recover any message that you send once it has been sent.</p>\n<p>g.\nWhen You Use Classmates Comment Fields, Message Boards, Events or Other Public Forums</p>\n<p>Information and content submitted to comment fields, message boards, events and other public forums on the Classmates Services are displayed publicly, so please exercise care in deciding what information and content you wish to disclose.\nBecause this information is publicly displayed through these Services, it may be included in these Services search tools and on third-party websites and devices as described in Section 2(h) below.\nPlease keep in mind that, because of the interactive nature of these forums, in many cases you will not be able to remove or revise the information or content that you submit in these areas of these Services and such information or content may remain on these Services even if your membership is terminated.\nTo protect the privacy of our members, we do not allow the public posting of personal contact information.\nWe have the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content within the comment fields, message boards, events and other public forums on these Services.\nPlease review our \"Classmates Member Conduct - Community Guidelines\" (found in our Terms of Service.) for more information regarding your appropriate use of these areas.</p>\n<p>h.\nWhen You Use Classmates \"Invite-A-Friend,\" \"Email this Page\" or Other Email Referral Services</p>\n<p>If you elect to use any of our referral services for informing friends via email about the Classmates Services or any portion thereof, you will be asked to provide your friends' names and email address.\nWe will then automatically send your friends a one-time email, plus a reminder email if you so choose (each of which will usually include your name and email address) inviting them to visit these Services.\nWe ask for this information for the sole purpose of sending these emails and tracking the success of our email referral program.</p>\n<p>i.\nWhen You Build a Classmates Personal Profile</p>\n<p>We have created tools to enable you to build a personal profile to share as much information about yourself as you wish on the Services.\nExcept as otherwise noted, when you use a specific profile tool all information that you add to your profile is publicly viewable and may be included in the Services search tools, on our affiliates\u2019 and brands\u2019 Websites, and on third-party websites and devices as described in Sections 2(b) and 2(i) below.\nFor this reason, please use care in providing information that you may not want to publicly disclose.\nTo protect the privacy of our members, we do not allow the public posting of personal contact information.\nAdditionally, please see the Classmates Member Conduct - Community Guidelines in our Terms of Service for more information regarding the limitations on the types of information that you may post on your personal profile and elsewhere on these Services.\nAs provided in our Terms of Service, we may use the information you provide in your profile in a variety of our products and features, such as affiliation-specific emails.\nThis enables us to provide our members with information in a more personalized fashion.\nIf you feel that a profile depicting you or your likeness has been created without your consent, please contact Classmates Customer Support to request its removal.</p>\n<p>j.\nWhen You View Other Classmates Members' Profiles</p>\n<p>We give you the ability to find other members and view their personal profiles by browsing the affiliation lists, clicking on or hovering over a tagged name or photo in a yearbook, using the search functionality on the Classmates Services, or otherwise providing a link on the Classmates.com Website or in an email that takes you to a member's profile.\nIf you view any portion of another Classmates member's profile, your name and the date of your visit will be accessible by that member as someone who visited that member's profile unless you remove that specific visit or choose to opt out of having your name automatically left on other members' profiles, which you can do by accessing the \"Account\" section on the Classmates.com Website and changing your preferences.\nIf you opt out of automatically having your name left on other members' profiles, you will still have the ability to leave your name on specific members' profiles on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>k.\nWhen You Participate in Surveys</p>\n<p>From time-to-time we may request information from our users via surveys relating to the Services or on behalf of our affiliates or third-party advertisers.\nWhen you participate in a survey, we may request personal contact information (such as your name and email address) or demographic information (such as your zip code, age or income level).\nWe conduct surveys relating to the Services in order to target advertising and content and to better understand members' needs and opinions.\nWe may share, in aggregate form, information we collect from these surveys with our advertisers, partners, affiliates and the general public, but we will not share survey information containing personal information with any third party without your prior consent.\nParticipation in these surveys is completely voluntary, such that you have the choice of whether you wish to disclose the requested information.</p>\n<p>l.\nWhen You or Third Parties Contact Us</p>\n<p>If you contact us by phone, email or letter, we may keep a record of such correspondence.\nThus, if you report an issue with the Services, we may collect such information in a file specific to your account.\nMoreover, if you contact us through our feedback area, we require your name and email address in order to send you a reply.\nAdditionally, if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Services, we may keep the information in a file specific to you.</p>\n<p>m.\nHow We May Supplement Your Information</p>\n<p>In order for us to provide the best overall experience for you and other members of the Services, we may from time to time supplement the information we receive through your use of the Services with information from our affiliates and brands or internal or third-party resources.\nFor example, we may obtain updated email address information or purchase third-party marketing data and address information and add it to our existing database to update or supplement your profile.</p>2.\nSHARING YOUR INFORMATION<p>a.\nConfidentiality</p>\n<p>We only share your personal information with others when we have your permission or under the types of circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.\nIn addition, we limit access to your personal information to only those employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or Services to you or to do their jobs.</p>\n<p>b.\nAffiliates and Brands</p>\n<p>We may share your information between the PeopleConnect brands and within the family of companies that are part of and affiliated with PeopleConnect.\nOur affiliates and brands are listed on the PeopleConnect.us Website.\nWe do this so that we may combine and supplement information across different Services.\nFor example, Intelius search results and reports may include information that is publicly available on the Classmates Service.\nWe also may share your information with our affiliates and brands for their direct marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Please note that if we have already shared your information with our affiliates or brands prior to your request for deletion, your information will not automatically be removed from the databases of these affiliates or brands.\nTo request deletion of your information from our affiliates\u2019 or brands\u2019 databases, please contact Customer Support for the relevant Service.</p>\n<p>c.\nThird-Party Advertising and Ad Servers/Networks</p>\n<p>While using our Services, you may be presented with advertisements or offers from unaffiliated third parties.\nWe may also use your information to provide you with third-party advertisements or offers that are targeted to your specific needs and interests.\nThese advertisements link directly to third-party websites or services.\nIf you decide to sign-up for or purchase a product or service from a third party, you are providing your information to that party and subjecting yourself to its policies and practices.\nWe have no control over the content or privacy policies or practices of such websites or services, and therefore we encourage you to review such content and privacy policies and practices prior to submitting any personal information to them.\nWe do not control these third parties and you agree that we are not liable for their acts or any failure to act on their part.\nWe do share certain aggregate information, such as demographic information and the number of times that our members have viewed an advertisement, with our third-party advertisers.\nThis information is not linked with any personal information, and we do not provide any such information to third-party advertisers except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We may use aggregated, statistical information to describe our membership and to establish advertising and other business relationships with third parties.</p>\n<p>We may serve you with targeted advertisements based on your personal information, but we do not provide any of your personal information to an advertiser or any third party with the exception of those uses expressly disclosed in this Privacy Policy.\nHowever, if you click an advertisement on the Services, then you consent to the possibility that the advertiser may assume that you meet the targeting criteria, if any, that we use to display such advertisement and, as described above, you will be subject to the advertiser's privacy policy and information collection and use practices.</p>\n<p>We may also allow other unaffiliated companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements containing cookies, pixels or web beacons on the Services.\nWe may also share certain limited categories of information about you (such as your gender, age or geographic location), as well as other non-identifiable information (such as hashed identifiers or obfuscated user data), with these third parties to help them deliver
