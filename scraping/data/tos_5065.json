processing and provide you with an opportunity to object.</p>\n3.\nCookies and Related Tracking Technologies\n<strong>What are cookies?</strong>\n<p>We may collect information using tracking technologies such as \u201ccookies.\u201d Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.\nWe may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites.</p>\n<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, issued directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services.\nand (2) third party cookies, which are issued by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>\n<strong>Cookies we use</strong>\n<strong>Type of cookie</strong>\n<strong>Purpose&nbsp;</strong>\n<em>Essential Cookies &nbsp.\n&nbsp;</em>\nThese cookies are essential to provide you with Services available through our Sites and to enable you to use their features fully.\nFor example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those Services.\n<em>Functionality &nbsp;Cookies</em>\nThese cookies allow us to remember choices you make when you visit our Sites, such as remembering your language preferences, and remembering your login details.\nThe purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use our Services.\n<em>Analytics and Performance Cookies</em>\nThese cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use Services.\nThe information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, though it includes IP addresses that can be used to do so.\nIt includes the number of visitors to each Site, the websites that referred them to that Site, the pages visited and for how long, the time of day of that session, whether this is a new or repeat visit, and other similar information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of utilization of all our Services.\n<em>Social Media Cookies</em>\nThese cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or \u201clike\u201d button related to our Services, or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn or Twitter.\nThe social media site will record that you have done this.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Disabling cookies</strong>\n<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings.\nIn order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the \u201csettings,\u201d \u201chelp,\u201d \u201ctools,\u201d or \u201cedit\u201d facilities).\nMany browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your

Support Center.</p>\n4.\nPixel Tags and Related Tracking Technologies\n<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users of our Services.\nUnlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages.\nPixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively.\nThe information we collect using pixel tags may be linked to your personal data.</p>\n5.\nAdvertising\n<p>We currently do not use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services.</p>\n<p>We may use Remarketing with Google Analytics,

vendors, may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site.\nThese remarketing tools do not identify you to use personally unless you respond to an advertisement that you received directly from the service.\nFor information on how you can opt out of a third-party vendor\u2019s use of cookies for interest-based ads please visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or control the use of your device identifiers by using your device\u2019s settings options.</p>\n6.\nUsing Your Personal Data\n<p>We

Initiative (CITI Program) provides educational materials to affiliates of its organizational subscribers, and to its individual subscribers, using websites and other forms of information exchange.\nThe CITI Program is a division of Biomedical Research Alliance of New York (\u201cBRANY\u201d), a limited liability corporation based in Lake Success, NY, United States of America.</p>\n<p>ACCESS TO AND USE OF CITI PROGRAM WEBSITES AND THEIR CONTENTS, AND TO OTHER CITI PROGRAM MATERIALS, ARE SUBJECT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS TO OUR PRIVACY AND COOKIE POLICY AND COPYRIGHT.\nPLEASE READ THEM CAREFULLY.</p>\n<p>Subscribing organizations, their Affiliated Learners, and/or Independent Learners shall acquire no other rights in any CITI Program services or materials unless specifically and expressly granted by CITI Program in writing.\nAll the intellectual property rights in the CITI Program services and materials are owned by CITI Program or its licensors.&nbsp;CITI Program reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to terminate account access and use of its services to any Subscribing Organization, any affiliates of a Subscribing Organization, or to any Independent Learner, for failure to follow the terms and conditions described in these Terms of Service.\nCITI Program also reserves the right to pursue any remedy available to it by law or equity, including but not limited to all remedies and reporting afforded through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, for failure to follow the terms and conditions described in these Terms of Service.</p>\n1.\nAccount Eligibility\n<p>CITI Program accounts are available to persons 18 years of age or older without restriction, subject to a valid affiliation with an active CITI Program Subscriber Organization or a valid registration of an Independent Learner subscription.</p>\n<p>Persons under 18 years of age must seek parental permission for creation of an account and subsequent use of the CITI Program\u2019s materials.\nCITI Program accounts are not available to persons under 13 years of age.&nbsp;Persons creating CITI Program accounts from its website or through organizational portals agree as a condition of use that they are: (a) 18 years of age or older.\nor (b) if under 18, have parental permission to access CITI Program materials, and are over 13 years of age.\nSubscriber Organizations creating CITI Program accounts are solely responsible for ensuring age and permission requirements for their Affiliated Learners.</p>\n<p>CITI Program offers accounts to two types of learners: Affiliated Learners and Independent Learners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cAffiliated Learners\u201d are persons with an active employment, educational, or other affiliation with a Subscriber Organization, whose access to CITI Program materials is based on a Subscriber Organization\u2019s current (paid up) subscription.\nAn \u201cactive affiliation\u201d with a Subscriber Organization is defined as: (a) current employment as a full- or part-time employee of that organization, or affiliation in any other professional capacity, including affiliation as a volunteer.\nor (b) current enrollment as a full or part-time student at that organization, or in another trainee capacity.\nor (c) currently working on research that is funded, co-funded, or co-conducted by the Subscriber Organization.\nFor purposes of clarity, membership in an association or organization, or any relationship with a commercial institutional review board or contract research organization that subscribes to CITI Program, does not constitute an active affiliation with that Subscriber Organization.\nCITI Program access cannot be offered by any Subscribing Organization as part of its paid or unpaid membership benefit or as part of its contracted services without express written approval from CITI Program.\nClaiming an active affiliation with a Subscribing Organization to which one is not entitled may be considered fraud, and will result in disabling of all account credentials.</li>\n<li>\u201cSite\u201d shall mean a facility owned and/or operated by or actively affiliated with a Subscribing Organization where 30 or more employees, agents, or students of the organization (at the site) or the active affiliate will complete CITI Program courses.\nSites will require a separate paid subscription to the CITI Program, either paid directly to CITI Program as a Subscriber Organization or as a paid Site of the Subscriber Organization with which it is actively affiliated.</li>\n<li>\u201cIndependent Learners\u201d are persons who have no active affiliation with a CITI Program Subscriber Organization, or who wish to have access to materials that the organization(s) with which they are affiliated do(es) not provide under an organizational subscription.</li>\n<li>\u201cSubscribing Organizations\u201d are those organizations that obtain access to the CITI Program on behalf of their employees, students, and other affiliates by purchasing a subscription.</li>\n<li>\u201cSite Administrators\u201d are persons designated by their Subscriber Organization to make determinations about the configuration of content access for and to access administrative information about their Affiliated Learners (such as reports of coursework completions).\nSite Administrators\u2019 accounts have additional privileges for data access and reporting.\nSubscribing Organizations are expected to designate their Site Administrators appropriately and to keep those designations current.</li>\n</ul>\n2.\nAccount Credentials and Access\n<p>The CITI Program website contains \u201cpublic\u201d areas and contents that are accessible to all persons.\nand it contains areas that are \u201cprivate,\u201d which may be accessed only by valid, active CITI Program account holders after login with assigned username and password credentials.</p>\n<p>Usernames and passwords that authenticate your identity for access to CITI Program accounts are of two types: (1) Issued by CITI Program itself, known as \u201cCITI Program account credentials\u201d.\n(2) Issued by CITI Program Subscriber Organizations that allow their affiliated learners to use organization-assigned usernames and passwords for access to CITI Program, known as \u201csingle-sign-on account credentials\u201d or \u201cSSO account credentials.\u201d Persons using CITI Program may have more than one set of username and password credentials to access the same account (e.g., one set issued by CITI Program, and one or more set(s) issued by organization(s) with which the learner is affiliated that use single-sign-on).</p>\n3.\nConduct of Affiliated and Independent Learners\n<p>CITI Program and Subscribing Organizations take training requirements very seriously.\nCITI Program training materials are designed to fulfill organizational policies and legal-regulatory mandates.\nMisuse of CITI Program content can result in organizational responses that include disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment or enrollment, reporting to funders, reporting to legal authorities, and legal action by CITI Program and/or the organizations subscribing to its content.</p>\n<p>All users of the CITI Program website and its content should understand that CITI Program keeps account activity logs, including computer IP addresses, time spent in each content area, number of quiz attempts and scores.\nSee the CITI Program&nbsp;Privacy&nbsp;and Cookie Policy, which governs collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.\nAllegations of inappropriate use will be investigated, and the results may be reported to the organization(s) with which a learner is affiliated.\nInappropriate use may result in immediate account suspension or termination.</p>\n<p>Persons who use the CITI Program website and its other educational content are expected to adhere to Learner Standards of Conduct, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accessing only CITI Program materials designated for the organization(s) with which the learner is appropriately affiliated, or for which the learner has created a valid Independent Learner registration by individual payment or other means.\nKnowing misrepresentation of affiliation or payment status is considered fraud.</li>\n<li>Maintaining only one CITI Program account, unless granted permission for multiple accounts by an organization with which the learner is affiliated or by CITI Program.\nThe CITI Program Help Desk can assist with merging duplicate accounts that were created by mistake.</li>\n<li>Not sharing CITI Program account usernames and passwords.\nUse of a CITI

to the CITI Program.</li>\n<li>Not accessing the CITI Program to build a product using similar ideas, features, functions, interface, or graphics of the CITI Program.</li>\n<li>Not circumventing, disabling, or otherwise interfering with any features of the CITI Program in a manner that prevents, restricts, or limits the access of valid users.</li>\n<li>Not copying, sharing, or engaging in any other unauthorized manipulation of any CITI Program or third party content.</li>\n<li>Not deleting the copyright or other proprietary rights notices on the CITI Program materials and website.</li>\n<li>Completing all required quizzes and any other assessments without assistance, using only the learner\u2019s own work.</li>\n<li>Not sharing CITI Program course content on any website, via email, photocopying, or any other means, unless approved by the learner\u2019s affiliated organization or by CITI Program.\nSuch sharing may be considered a copyright violation,
