of our partners and for our customers, which are automatically selected on the basis of your surfing behaviour, in order to optimise the quality of the advertising notices for you (so-called \u201cpersonalised\u201d or \u201cbehaviour-based\u201d advertising delivery and \u201cbehavioral targeting\u201d).\nThe objective of this system is to only demonstrate to you content that corresponds to your interests.\nAdvertisements which are unlikely to be of interest to you or which are irrelevant will not be shown to you by the activated behavioral targeting system of LiquidM and will be disabled.</p>\n<p>In such a case, this section IV.\nof the data protection declaration applies as part of the respective web-based services of our partners or customers, from which (for example under \u201cdata protection\u201d or \u201cdata protection declaration\u201d direct reference was made or a link was created.\nWe wish to disclose to you in a transparent manner how the behavioral targeting works, which data is gathered in the process, how this data is used and for what purpose and how you can object to the behavioral targeting function at any time and block it.</p>\n<p>As a German/European company, the protection of your data is a priority for LiquidM, also in the course of the delivery of behavior-based advertising and LiquidM only uses anonymized data to improve advert quality.\nTherefore, an identification of your person is not possible either for LiquidM or the respective operator of the website of our partners and customers which you are visiting.\nYou can yourself decide at any time whether you would like to continue seeing the personalized banner from LiquidM.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>a) How does behavioral targeting work in individual cases?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We take part in a programmatic auction system where placements for advertisement in apps and websites are sold.\nIn this process, we may collect information about you and your use of the website or app.\nThis information cannot be used to identify you in real life but it does enable us to recognize your device when you use sites or apps that have partnered with us.</p>\n<p>Another way we may deliver personalized advertising to you is when you visit the website of one of our partners or customers.\nOn some of these sites, a cookie file is stored on your computer.\nCookies are small text files which are deposited by your web browser in a folder on your computer which is designated for this purposes and which contains a single character string as a means of identification.\n(The cookie does not store your IP address.) The same character string is also saved on our servers.\nThe next time you visit one of our partners\u2019 websites, only the character string is read which identifies the Internet browser you are using.\nThis allows us, for example, to identify which page you have accessed for our partner and which advert you have been shown, without this being linked to your identity.\nFurthermore, all of the cookies created by us are given an expiry data and automatically expire after no more than 13 months.\nWithout a valid cookie file, the character strong saved on our servers is no longer to be assigned for us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Important:</b> Using cookies we cannot ever collect any other personal data.\nFor example, when you enter an email address or delivery address, or any other personal data, we cannot see your input and cannot, therefore, process or store it.\nWe do not know your name, address or workplace, nor do we know your gender, age, email address or any other personally identifiable information about you.\nEven the IP address of your computer is not stored! You can view the data stored in the cookie on your computer.\nPlease refer to your web browser\u2019s help directory or your web browser\u2019s FAQ to learn how cookies are stored and how to read their content.\nThe information contained within the cookie is the exact data that we can see Cookie technology does not allow viruses, trojans or other harmful programs to be placed on your computer.</p>\n<p>A full list of the cookies used by LiquidM and their individual functions can be downloaded here at any time.\nShould you not agree to the saving of cookies on our part, you can examine your cookie status at the very top of this page at any time, and also deactivate the saving of behavioral targeting cookies by us.\nTherefore you can object to the personalized adverts from LiquidM at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>b) How can I disable personalized advertising from LiquidM banners?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not agree to the storing of cookies by us, you can check your cookie status at any time at the very top of this page and disable the storage of retargeting cookies by us and therefore decline personalized adverts from LiquidM.</p>\n<p>This means that in future you will receive random advertising that is not targeted to your interests.</p>\n<p>Please note that the \u201copt-out\u201d and \u201copt-in\u201d functions offered are, for technical reasons, also controlled via cookies.\nThis means that deleting all cookies on your computer means that you will have to opt-out again.</p>\n<p>It is also the case that the deletion of all cookies on your computer does not lead to no personalized advertising being notified to you on a permanent basis.\nTherefore, you must use the &nbsp;\u201copt-out\u201d function as described.</p>\n<p>Finally, please note that we are continuously expanding our range of products.\nAs this will technically involve a new system, the introduction of a new opt-out may be necessary, even if you have already opted prior to its introduction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c) Can other forms of personalized advertising be disabled in addition to LiquidM?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The options described in this section refer only to the personalized adverts offered by LiquidM.\nIf you wish to disable personalized advertising from other providers, you can do this via their respective websites.</p>\n<p>There is an option to change your settings collectively for various providers under preference management on \u201cYour Online Choices\u201d:&nbsp;<em>http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/</em>.</p>\n<p>If you want to opt-out from the usage of the Advertising ID, please refer to your operating system settings, or follow the instructions below:</p>\n<p>Android Users (version 2.3 and above) To use the \u201copt-out of interest-based advertising\u201d option, follow the instructions provided by Google here: <i>Google Play Help</i>.</p>\n<p>iOS users (version 6 and above) To use the \u201cLimit Ad-Tracking\u201d option, follow the instructions provided by Apple here: <i>Apple Support Center</i>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that these are device settings and will disable interest-based ads from all providers, and not just for us</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d) We also collect information about the advertisements that have been served to you by LiquidM and match them we the Advertising ID from the programmatic buying process.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Information about the ads can contain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the details of the ad delivered (e.g.\nadvertiser\u2019s name, type of advert, etc);</li>\n<li>the website or the app where the ad was delivered;</li>\n<li>your interaction with the ad (i.e.\nwhether you clicked, hid, muted or otherwise interacted with the ad);</li>\n<li>whether you performed certain actions after clicking on the ad (e.g.\ndownloading an application, making a purchase, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>e) </strong>\n<strong>How do we use the collected information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect to display interest-based advertising customized to individuals\u2019 inferred interests, preferences and locations, and to perform analysis aimed at improving our services and technologies.\nWe also need the information in the billing process with our customers and to validate the billings we receive from our partners.\nThe information we collect also helps us to provide filtering options for publishers and developers to manage ads appearing on their sites and in their apps, and to provide targeting options for advertisers.\nIn the end, this helps publishers and developer clients, for example, not to present you ads that you have already seen, and helps our advertiser clients serve adverts that are most likely to be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Important:</strong> We do not store the IP-Addresses un-anonymized or the Geographic location</p>\n<p>\n<strong>f)&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>LiquidM

encourage you to learn more about how Google\u2019s products use data from sites and apps that use their services from the following partner-facing&nbsp;documentation.\nFor more information, please
