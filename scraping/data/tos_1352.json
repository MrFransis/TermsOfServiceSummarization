Inc.\ncollects and how we use it within the applications, services and websites.\nIn addition to Anonyome Labs, Inc., all subsidiaries of Anonyome Labs, Inc.\nalso adhere to the content in this privacy policy.</p> Introduction \u2013 Take Control of Your Privacy <p>This Privacy Policy tells you how we (Anonyome Labs, Inc.) collect, use and share the personal information we collect from users of our websites, including https://anonyome.com,&nbsp;https://mysudo.com and https://support.mysudo.com (the \u201cwebsites\u201d), our mobile applications (each an \u201cApplication\u201d) and online services (\u201cServices\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Summary</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We build our apps with a single intent: Give the user control.\nThis philosophy guides everything we do.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We make every effort to not ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your legal name, phone number, email address or your phone contacts to register for our services.\nYou should not have to give it to us to utilize our offerings, unless explicitly required by industry or government regulations.</li>\n<li>We mandate that you use our applications and services in a lawful and respectful way.\nWe refer to this as \u201c<strong>responsible anonymity</strong>\u201d.</li>\n<li>We do collect anonymized data about how our Applications perform, which areas are more or less favored by users, and other performance-based metrics.\nWe do this to improve our product and services.\nYou may opt-out of this in the Application\u2019s settings.</li>\n<li>We do not sell, trade or exchange personally identifiable information with third parties, and never will.</li>\n<li>We have no way \u2013 nor any desire \u2013 to track the precise location of our users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>User Consent</strong>\n<br>\nBy submitting personal information through our websites, Applications or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not agree with our policies and practices, you can choose to stop using our Applications and Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A Note to Users Outside of the United States</strong>\n<br>\nIf you are a non-U.S.\nuser of our websites, by visiting the websites and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.\nIn addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.\nBy providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>\n<p>Anonyome Labs, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.\nAnonyome\u2019s Privacy Shield statement is available here.</p> The Information We Collect <p>\n<strong>Applications and Services</strong>\n<br>\nWhen you use an Application, we will collect the information that you voluntarily provide to us.\nFor example, when you contact us via email, you are providing an email address and email content, and we use this information in order to communicate with you.</p>\n<p>The virtual cards capability (\u201cVirtual Cards\u201d) offered in our Applications requires by law that we verify your legal identity before you can use the capability.\nIn this case, you may be required to provide your name, address, date of birth and government issued identification document, as well as information about a funding source for virtual card transactions, such as your credit card, bank account and billing details.\nYour legal identity is associated with your Application account if you use the virtual cards capability.</p>\n<p>As is typical of most online services, we automatically collect certain technical data and information that we use to provide and make our Services better.\nWhen your Application instance accesses our Services, we store certain information about your requests including date/time, type of request (e.g.\nsend SMS), application version and IP address.\nWe use this information to ensure the integrity and security of our services.\nThis information does not allow Anonyome Labs to associate requests with existing mobile subscriber information including name and address.</p>\n<p>We collect non-personally identifying information about your Application download such as date/time, application store region and application version.\nWe use this information to make our Services better.\nThis information does not allow Anonyome Labs to associate a download with a mobile platform user, e.g.\nan Apple ID or Google account.</p>\n<p>If enabled in the privacy settings of our Applications, we collect non-personally identifying information about how users use our Application and Services, in order to improve them.\nWe use Amazon Web Services Pinpoint and Braze for this purpose.</p>\n<p>Information you provide is stored in systems located in the United States.\nThis is the case for both Anonyome controlled systems as well as those of the third-party services mentioned above.\nWe retain this information in the Service for a limited period to maintain our quality of service and handle support requests.\nYou may read more about data retention in this article: https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006599413-How-long-do-you-store-information-</p>\n<p>If you choose to accept Push Notifications from our Applications, we store a unique identifier that is only for the purpose of sending notifications via Apple (iOS) or Google (Android) to our Applications on your device, and doesn\u2019t allow Anonyome Labs to identify your mobile device\u2019s serial number, phone number or information regarding your Apple ID or Google account.</p>\n<p>Anonyome Labs neither retrieves nor processes information about your Application identities from sites or services external to the Applications and Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Websites</strong>\n<br>\nWe store and process certain information that is provided automatically as part of your Web browser accessing our websites.\nThis information includes data/time, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, browser type and browser language/locale.\nWe use this information to analyze trends, administer the websites and to better tailor our websites to our users\u2019 needs.</p>\n<p>We use technology to protect our web sites from spam and other forms of abuse.\nThis does not allow us to know the identity of who is accessing our web sites.</p>\n<p>If you choose to provide your email address to subscribe to privacy, security and cyber safety tips, your email address will be stored and processed on the Mailchimp platform.</p>\n<p>The MySudo Support Site (https://support.mysudo.com) is hosted on the Zendesk platform.\nIf you choose to participate in the Community feature of this site, you are required to create an account in order to post messages.\nCreating an account requires that you provide an email address.\nThis email address is not used by Anonyome to contact community users directly.</p> How We Use Your Information <p>The purpose of our Applications and Services is to allow users control of their information so they can decide and control if and when to share their information with others.\nGenerally, it is up to you how your information is shared, what information is shared, and with whom.</p>\n<p>We use your personal information to: (a) provide you the Services that you request.\n(b) improve the quality of experience you receive when you interact with our websites, Applications and Services.\n(c) send you administrative email notifications, such as security, support and maintenance advisories.\nand (d) respond to your inquiries.</p>\n<p>When you use the Applications and Services, we will share your Sudo information with those third parties designated by you in order to facilitate the services you are using.\nFor example, if you send an email from a Sudo, your Sudo email address is sent to the receiving email server as part of delivering the email.</p>\n<p>We may disclose information if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary a) to comply with relevant laws and lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\nb) to protect the rights and property of Anonyome Labs, Inc.\nand/or c) to protect users of the websites, Services and Applications.\nWe refer to this as \u201c<strong>anonymity with recourse</strong>\u201d.</p>\n<p>If you chose to provide your legal identity information in order to use Virtual Cards, we use that information to verify your legal identity.\nThis requires that we share that information with a third-party service provider, IDology, to perform the identity verification.\nWe will share your legal identity information with law enforcement agencies in response to a proper and lawful request, such as a subpoena or search warrant.\nWe will not use your legal identity information to communicate with you, nor will we ever sell that information to a third party.</p>\n<p>When you authorize use of your existing credit card or bank account as a funding source for your virtual cards, information is sent from your device to our payment processors as evidence of your agreement to debit your funding source.\nThat information includes your credit card number, credit card billing address, credit card expiration date, IP address and mobile device user agent at the time you provide your authorization.</p>\n<p>It may be necessary for us to share some of your personal data with a merchant if you open a dispute for a virtual card transaction.\nIn these cases, we only share what is necessary to resolve the dispute.</p> Your Choices Regarding Your Information <p>You have several choices regarding use of information on our Services.</p>\n<p>Under regulations including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Directive (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), users may have certain legal rights to access certain information that Anonyome Labs, Inc holds about them and to request erasure of that information.\nTo

regulations.</p>\n<p>If you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you have the ability to

preferences, we may send you essential service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Applications by uninstalling the Applications.\nYou may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Websites</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The websites may contain links to third party websites.\nWhen you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our website and go to another site, and another entity may collect personal information or anonymous data from you.\nWe have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these third-party websites or their content.</p> Contact Us <p>Do you have any comments, complaints, concerns, questions, requests, or suggestions, about our data collection or processing

because it is.\nHere\u2019s the summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We believe that privacy and anonymity are crucial components of the modern Internet.</li>\n<li>We mandate that our users use our applications and services in a lawful and respectful way.\nWe refer to this as \u201c<strong>responsible anonymity</strong>\u201d.\nWe describe some counterexamples in the \u201cCertain Restrictions\u201d section below.</li>\n<li>Like many other services, we include fair use clauses to protect us from users who try to misuse the service for other than its intended use.\nWe describe what that is in the

protect us from, or comply with local, regional, or international law.</li>\n<li>Finally, because offering telephony services is a heavily regulated industry, we have to tell you things like

use our Services, this TOS applies to that use, but here are some of the points about the Websites, Applications, and Services that you should be particularly aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The TOS includes a class action waiver and waiver of jury trials and requires binding arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes relating in any way to your use of the Services.\nBy entering into the TOS,

\u201cSudo identities\u201d.\nWe encrypt all content sent from and received by your Sudo.\nThe ONLY decryption key is stored on your mobile device, meaning we cannot associate your Sudo with your

Services are for lawful, proper and appropriate purposes only.\nCriminal activity through our Services is expressly prohibited.\nWe will terminate your use of our Services if you violate these rules.</li>\n<li>If you subscribe to certain Paid Services (as defined in the \u201cFees\u201d section) for a term (the \u201cInitial Term\u201d), then the term will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Term at our then-current fee for such Paid Services, unless you opt out of the auto-renewal in accordance with the Section entitled \u201cFees\u201d below.</li>\n<li>We provide communication services, such as email, that consume storage space on our servers.\nYou may be provided with the option to purchase additional storage entitlements.</li>\n<li>We own everything we have produced for the Website, the Application, the Services, the Software (defined below) and any information, data, text, software, music, sound,

Level 1 certified third-party processor to process transactions funded by your funding source.\nYour credit card information is never transmitted through or stored in our Services.\nIn order to charge your funding source when you use your virtual card, we store a payment token corresponding to your funding source in our PCI DSS Level 1 certified Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Using Virtual Cards<br>\n</strong>When a virtual card is used, we charge a fee for providing the Service.\nThe fee is charged at the same time as the merchant charge.\nThe original purchase amount of a transaction and the fee are charged in a single transaction on your funding source.\nThe exact fee you will be charged is shown in the Applications that offer virtual cards.</p>\n<p>Merchants may charge your virtual card when you are off-line, such as when a merchant bills you for a periodic subscription to their products and services.\nYou agree to us storing a payment token corresponding to each of your funding sources for these transactions.</p>\n<p>A merchant may split your purchase into multiple transactions, such as when items are available, dispatched or shipped at different times.\nIn these cases which result in multiple charges to your virtual card, there will be a corresponding number of charges to your funding source, each incorporating the fee as described at the beginning of this section.</p>\n<p>A merchant may charge your virtual card for more than the original purchase amount, such as when you change your order after it is placed, update your shipping address or add a tip or

law.</p>\n<p>If a transaction is partially or fully refunded, the money will be refunded to your funding source that was associated with your virtual card at the time the transaction was made.\nRefunds normally take 5-10 business days.</p>\n<p>Virtual cards can only be used with merchants located in the United States.\nVirtual card transactions will be charged in United States dollars

or total amount of transactions in a time period.\nThese limits are subject to review, increase or decrease at our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disputes and Chargebacks</strong>\n<br>\nIf you experience a problem with a merchant when you use your virtual card, you must resolve any issue with the merchant directly.\nBy using the Applications and Services, you expressly agree that all merchant specific disputes will be handled between you and the merchant directly.</p>\n<p>Disputing a charge from us on your bank statement that is related to a virtual card is filing a dispute

virtual card.\nIf you file a chargeback against Anonyome Labs, Inc that Anonyome Labs, Inc contests and wins (i.e.\nyou lose the chargeback) you will be charged a $25 chargeback processing fee.\nThere is no chargeback processing fee if you win a contested chargeback.&nbsp.\nThe chargeback processing fees will be charged to a funding source that you have configured in the Application.</p>\n<p>If we observe an excessive number of disputes or chargebacks resulting from your virtual card activity, we may establish additional conditions on your account, including suspending or terminating your use of our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Prevention of Fraud, Money Laundering and Funding of Terrorist Activities<br>\n</strong>We are committed to ensuring that our Services are used responsibly and in a lawful manner.\nWe refer to this as \u201cresponsible anonymity\u201d.\nWe use preventative measures, such as identity verification and limiting where virtual cards can be used, as well as automated analysis of virtual card transactions and other activity to identify potential incidences of fraud, money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities.\nIn some cases, we may suspend an account, which will result in future transactions on the virtual cards being declined.\nWe are committed to work with our users to understand and resolve issues with accounts being suspended

USER.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Release</strong>\n<br>\nYou hereby release the Anonyome Parties and their successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death, and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from any use of the Anonyome Properties, Applications, or any interactions with or conduct of other users of the Anonyome Properties or third party websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of these Terms or your use of the Anonyome Properties.\nIf you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, \u201cA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Indemnification</strong>\n<br>\nYou agree to

Terms.\n(b) your violation of any rights of another party, or (c) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.\nAnonyome reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Anonyome in asserting any available defenses.\nYou agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of the Services or these Terms.</p> Term and Termination <p>\n<strong>Term</strong>\n<br>\nThese Terms renew on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use the Anonyome Properties, unless terminated earlier in accordance with these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Termination of Services<br>\n</strong>Subject to the terms herein, if you want to terminate the Services provided by Anonyome, you may do so by deleting the Application from your devices and cancelling any associated subscriptions or memberships.\nAnonyome has the right to suspend or terminate any Services provided to you for any reason, including if you have materially breached any provision of the Terms, if Anonyome is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Anonyome Properties is, or becomes, unlawful).\nYou agree that all terminations for cause shall be made at Anonyome\u2019s sole discretion.\nYou will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts previously paid to Anonyome for Paid Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Effect of Termination</strong>\n<br>\nIn the event of termination for any reason, you will immediately cease use of, and delete all Sudo identities that you created using the Anonyome Properties.\nAll provisions of these Terms, which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.</p> Limitation of Liability <p>\n<strong>DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES</strong>\n<br>\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL ANONYOME PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL

PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY ANONYOME AS A RESULT OF YOUR USE OF ANONYOME PROPERTIES IN THE ONE (1) MONTH IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE RELEVANT CLAIM.\nIF YOU HAVE NOT PAID ANONYOME ANY AMOUNTS IN SUCH PERIOD, ANONYOME\u2019S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO FIFTY DOLLARS ($50).\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, ANONYOME DOES NOT IN ANY WAY SEEK TO EXCLUDE OR LIMIT LIABILITY FOR (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY ANY ANONYOME PARTY\u2019S NEGLIGENCE.\nOR FOR (B) ANY INJURY CAUSED BY AN ANONYOME PARTY\u2019S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BASIS OF THE BARGAIN</strong>\n<br>\nYOU AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE

APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.</p> Disclaimer of Warranties <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR USE OF THE ANONYOME PROPERTIES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THE ANONYOME PROPERTIES ARE PROVIDED ON AN \u201cAS IS\u201d AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS.\nTHE ANONYOME PARTIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SECURITY, AND NON- INFRINGEMENT.</p> Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Waiver.\nWaiver of Trial by Jury <p>Please read this Section (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) carefully.\nIt is part of your contract with Anonyome and affects your rights.\nIt contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\nBy agreeing to arbitration, you are waiving your right to seek relief in a court of law.</p>\n<p>i.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nYou acknowledge and agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Websites, Applications or Services, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claim(s) qualify.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that you will not bring any class action claims in small claims court.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement.</p>\n<p>ii.\nWaiver of Jury Trial.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow these Terms as a court would.</p>\n<p>iii.\nCommencement of Arbitration Proceeding.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a certified letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Anonyome Labs, Inc., 32 West 200 South #315, Salt Lake City, UT 84101.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules.\nJAMS\u2019 rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS\u2019 rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, Anonyome will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>\n<p>iv.\nNo Class Actions.\nWe each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p> Contact Us <p>Do you have any comments, complaints, concerns, questions,
