expedite resolution and the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Service (\"Dispute\"), you and StyleSeat agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.\nSuch informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.\nYour address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to StyleSeat.\nStyleSeat's address for such notices is StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401.\n</p> Binding Arbitration <p> If you and StyleSeat are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org., Your arbitration fees and your share or arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).\nIf your claim for damages does not exceed USD 10,000, StyleSeat will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, you and StyleSeat may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\n</p> Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution.\n<p> Claims where mandatory arbitration is prohibited by a valid, non-preempted law, including claims under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, California Labor Code 2698 et seq.\n(\"PAGA\") to the extent waiver of such claim is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, are not covered by this arbitration provision.\nNothing in this arbitration provision will prevent either party from bringing an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.\n</p> Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding.\n<p> You and StyleSeat agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between StyleSeat and you individually.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND STYLESEAT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and StyleSeat otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\n</p> Location of Arbitration.\n<p> Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California.\nYou and StyleSeat agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.\n</p> Right to Opt out of Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.\n<p> You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision of these Terms of Service by <strong> notifying StyleSeat in writing within 30 days of the date your first registered for the Services or a Subscription or 30 days from the date these Terms of Service were last updated </strong> .\nTo opt out, you must send a written notification to StyleSeat at StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401, that includes (a) your user identification, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver sections.\n</p> Governing Law <p> You and StyleSeat agree that, other than as set forth under the subsection entitled \"Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding\" in Section 15 above, if any portion of Section 15 entitled \"Dispute Resolution\" is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of these Terms of Service will be given full force and effect.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the subsection entitled \"Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution\" in Section 15 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, neither you or StyleSeat will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of that subsection that is found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco, California, and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.\n</p>\n<p> Except as expressly provided otherwise, these Terms of Service are governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.\n</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, the enforceability of Section 15 entitled \"Dispute Resolution\" shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs.\n1-16).\n</p> Privacy <p> Our collection of data and information via the Services from Users and others is subject to our Privacy Policy which is available at https://styleseat.com/privacy/, and is incorporated herein (the \"Privacy Policy\").\nYou understand that through your use of the Services that you consent to the

their own risk.\nAll Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients, Professionals and any personnel of Professionals, as applicable.\nEach Professional must decide whether a Client is suited to such Professional's services and

payments through the Services and to defer delivery of earned payouts until you have provided (and StyleSeat has confirmed receipt of) your accurate User Tax Information (defined below).</p>\n<p>If in a given calendar year your payments through the Services meet the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or state taxing authority thresholds for required reporting, StyleSeat will report your User Tax Information annually to the IRS or other governing authority, as required by law.\nIf StyleSeat receives a notification from the IRS at any time that your User Tax Information is incomplete or inaccurate, StyleSeat will notify you immediately that you need to provide a completed W-9 form and reserves the right to (i) prohibit you from processing any additional payments through the Services and (ii) defer delivery of any earned payouts, until you have provided and StyleSeat has confirmed receipt of updated accurate User Tax Information.\nIf StyleSeat does not receive such

policy to Clients at the time of purchase, (c) not give cash refunds to a Client in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law, and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.\nThe amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Client for postage that the Client paid to return merchandise.\nIf you accept returns and are making an uneven exchange of merchandise (e.g., the sales price is not the same), you must issue a credit for the total amount of the merchandise being returned and complete a new sale for any new merchandise.\nPlease be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory to the Client, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.</p>\n<p>You can process a refund through your Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment.\nIf your available StyleSeat balance is insufficient to cover the refund, StyleSeat will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested refund amount from your bank account or debit card.\nStyleSeat will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account or debit card, and credit it back into your Client's Card.\nThe fees are also refunded by StyleSeat, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your Client.\nStyleSeat has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.</p> Liability for Chargebacks and Fraudulent Actions <p>The amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Account (a \"Chargeback\") if the

fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by the Association or our processor from your Account (including without limitation any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account or debit card, or other payment instrument registered with us.\nIf you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Account.\nFurther, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these Terms of Service until such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Client's complaint, in which case we will retain the funds.\n(b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Client may dispute that the transaction has

investigating Chargeback disputes.</p> StyleSeat Set-off Rights <p>You grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff against, and hereby assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to

obligation you owe us under these Terms of Service, including without limitation any Chargebacks.\nAll fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are deducted first from the transferred

connected Account (as well as set off against any balance in any connected Account).\nYour failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these Terms of Service.\nYou will be liable for our costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.</p>

STYLING SERVICES OR OTHERWISE.</p> Dispute Resolution Informal Negotiations <p>To expedite resolution and the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to these Terms of Service (\"Dispute\"), you and StyleSeat agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.\nSuch informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.\nYour address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to StyleSeat.\nStyleSeat's address for such notices is StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401.</p> Binding Arbitration <p>If you and StyleSeat are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Services (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and, where appropriate, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\"AAA Consumer Rules\"), both of which are available at the AAA website&nbsp;www.adr.org.\nYour arbitration fees and your share or arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).\nIf your claim for damages does not exceed USD 10,000, StyleSeat will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept as otherwise provided in these Terms of Service, you and StyleSeat may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p> Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution.\n<p>Claims where mandatory arbitration is prohibited by a valid, non-preempted law, including claims under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, California Labor Code 2698 et seq.\n(\"PAGA\") to the extent waiver of such claim is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, are not covered by this arbitration provision.\nNothing in this arbitration provision will prevent either party from bringing an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p> Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding.\n<p>You and StyleSeat agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between StyleSeat and you individually.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND STYLESEAT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and StyleSeat otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.</p> Location of Arbitration.\n<p>Arbitration will take place in San Francisco County, California.\nYou and StyleSeat agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p> Right to Opt out of Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.\n<p>You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision of these Terms of Service by&nbsp;notifying StyleSeat in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Services or a Subscription or 30 days from the date these Terms of Service were last updated.\nTo opt out, you must send a written notification to StyleSeat at StyleSeat, Inc., Attention: Legal, 548 Market St, PMB 80095, San Francisco, CA 94104-5401, that includes (a) your user identification, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver sections.</p> Governing Law.\n<p>You and StyleSeat agree that, other than as set forth under the subsection entitled \"Waiver of Right to be a Plaintiff or Class Member in a Purported Class Action or Representative Proceeding\" in Section 15 above, if any portion of Section 15 entitled \"Dispute Resolution\" is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of these Terms of Service will be given full force and effect.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the subsection entitled \"Exceptions to Alternative Dispute Resolution\" in Section 15 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, neither you or StyleSeat will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of that subsection that is found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within San Francisco, California, and you and StyleSeat agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>\n<p>Except as expressly provided otherwise, these Terms of Service are governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, without regard to choice of law principles.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, the enforceability of Section 15 entitled \"Dispute Resolution\" shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs.\n1-16).</p> Indemnification <p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners and licensors from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, debt and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from or relating to: (i) your use of and access to the Services.\n(ii) Styling Services facilitated by the Services or any interaction between you and another user.\n(iii) your violation of any term of these Terms of Service.\n(iv) your violation of any rights of a third party, including without limitation any copyright, intellectual property, or
