boards.\nAny actions you perform with other players are considered public, and are at your sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Information You Provide to Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We only collect email addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Non-Personal Information You Provide to Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, we and/or our Business Partners also collect other types of non-personal information

review Digital River\u2019s privacy policy, so that you are aware of how they treat your information when you make a purchase from our online store.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media Interaction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You also can engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter (or third-party social media plug-ins and applications).\nWhen you engage with our content on or through third-party social networking websites, plug-ins and applications, you may allow us to have access to certain information from your social media profile (e.g., name, e-mail address, photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the \u2018likes\u2019 you make) to deliver the content or as part of the operation of the application.\nWe may also obtain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., content viewed, game performance, high scores, and information about advertisements within the content you have been shown or may have clicked on) from your interaction with our content.</p>\n<p>When you provide information from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like (1) give you exclusive content, (2) personalize your online experience with us within and outside our websites (and/or applications), and (3) contact you through the social networking sites or directly by sending you the latest news, special offerings, and rewards.\nBy doing so, you consent to the use of this information in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nWhen you provide personal information to us through an application, on our websites, or on social networking websites, it may be publicly viewed by other members of these websites and we cannot prevent further use of the information by third parties.</p>\n<p>Through some social networking websites\u2019 privacy settings, you can control what data you share.\nFor more information about how social networking sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Collected Through Technology</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We and/or our Business Partners collect information through technology to make our Services more interesting and useful to you, although you may not realize this information is being collected.\nFor example, when you come to one of our websites or use our mobile apps, we collect your Internet Protocol address (\u201cIP address\u201d).\nAn IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university.\nAt times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our Services.\nWhen you access our Services using a mobile device, we and/or our Business Partners may also collect information such as the unique device identifier (\u201cUDID\u201d) of your device, identifier for advertisers (\u201cIDFA\u201d), identifier for vendors (\u201cIDFV\u201d), device type, and other technical information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Services also use cookies.\nCookies are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the Services.\nWe and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.\nFor example, when you return to one of our Services after logging in, cookies provide information to the Service so that the Service will remember who you are.\nYou can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.\nYou can do this through your browser (i.e.\nMozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer) settings.\nEach browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.\nIf you turn cookies off,

more information concerning the use of third party cookies on our Services, please&nbsp;contact us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web Beacons</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Services use a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including web beacons.\nWeb beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of our Services.\nWe also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Services, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Services.\nThese technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf.\nWe also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails or clicked on links in those e-mails.\nThe information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is personally identifiable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Network Advertisers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Many advertisements are managed and placed on our Services by advertisers and/or other third parties.\nThese companies are collectively called \u201cnetwork advertisers\u201d.\nNetwork advertisers who place advertisements on our Services may also use cookies and web beacons or other similar technology to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements).\nYou may not realize this information is being collected.\nIn some cases, we may have access to information from web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our sites and this information may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser.</p>\n<p>Finally, once you\u2019ve clicked on an advertisement and have left our Services, our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their website.</p> How is your personally identifiable information used and shared? <p>This Privacy Policy describes how we use and share your information.&nbsp.\nWe don\u2019t share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties without your consent (other than to our Business Partners).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Atari Tools and Updates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like updates on special events, game news, and email announcements of interest to our users.\nOccasionally, we share your personal information (e.g., email address) with a third party sponsor, co-sponsor, or other third party that provides products or services that may be of interest to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Blogs, Message Boards, and Community Forums</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you register for access to our blogs or message boards, we will use your personal information to enable you to view and post messages on the boards.\nHowever, you should understand that community forums, blogs, and message boards are tools that allow you to communicate with members of the online community.\nAs such, whenever you give out personal information in public areas, that information can be collected and used by people you don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p>If you wish to review, correct, or delete content or information you have publicly posted through our blogs, message boards, or community forums, you may do so by visiting the individual post and selecting the \u201cEdit\u201d option.\nAlternatively, you may contact us with your request at privacy@atari.com.\nPlease note that removal of this content or information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal.\nAfter your removal request has been honored, we may retain copies of the content or information you have previously posted on our servers.\nAdditionally, we are not required to remove your posted content or information if it has been rendered anonymous or if we are required by law to retain it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Operational Uses</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also use your personal information for other purposes such as \u201cOperational Uses\u201d.\nFor example, we and/or our Business Partners may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Services, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We occasionally use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services necessary to our operations.\nFor example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our web pages, process credit card transactions, analyze customers\u2019 interaction with our Services, and process consumer surveys.\nWe also provide postal addresses to the U.S.\nPost Office for delivery purposes.\nIn the course of providing such services, these companies have contact with your personally identifying information.\nThese entities have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal information received from us.</p>\n<p>We may use your name, profile picture and game play information to communicate with your friends that are also connected to the Service.\nWe may also disclose information about you to our Business Partners, in order to provide the website and application services, resolve service problems and correct errors in the Service, to communicate with you about the Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service and to enhance your experience on the Service.&nbsp.\nHowever, we do not give our Business Partners an independent right to share this information.\nDue to our contractual obligations with our Business Partners and the need to share information to deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing information (whether personal information or non-personal information) with these third parties.\nPlease do not use our Services if you do not agree with these terms.</p>\n<p>You may decide to provide us with another person\u2019s personal information such as email address so that the person may be invited to join the Service.&nbsp.\nWe use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join the Service or receive content from the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Finally, we and/or our Business Partners may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information) in an attempt to provide you with a better user experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze how our Service is used.\nGiven the nature of this information, no restrictions apply under this Privacy Policy on our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we and/or our Business Partners may use and share in any way with third parties the resulting non-personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.\nPersonal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g.\nresumes, event sponsorship, etc.) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Purchase or Sale of Businesses</strong>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.\nIf we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.\nIf we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).\nThe provisions of this paragraph will also apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Services and Others</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our Terms of Use.\nenforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules.\nprotect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you.\nand/or, protect the safety and security of our Services or third parties.</p> What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information? <p>As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us.\nIf at any time you decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by emailing us at privacy@atari.com, or contacting us via the Atari mailing address.</p>\n<p>You can access and update the contact information you gave us during registration (that is, your e-mail address or any other information that would directly enable us to contact you), by emailing us at privacy@atari.com or by changing your contact information by logging into the applicable Services.</p>\n<p>You may review, update, correct or delete any personal information disclosed via social networks by changing the applicable information in your profile page on Facebook and/or other social network(s) as well as with your mobile carrier or application store for mobile applications.\nIf you completely delete all this information, your accounts associated with the Services may become deactivated.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting Out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Should you wish to opt-out of any of the Atari Services you have previously agreed to, i.e.\nreceiving a newsletter, you may do so by:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nfollowing the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of the newsletter email you wish to stop receiving,</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nlogging into your Atari account and editing your profile
