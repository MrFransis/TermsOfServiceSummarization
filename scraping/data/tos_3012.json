processors\u201c) on our behalf.\nSpecifically, these data processors include suppliers of marketing tools, IT service providers, providers of other tools and software solutions, IT maintenance services and other providers of similar services.\nAll of our data processors process your data exclusively based on a contract in accordance with the provisions of data protection laws.\nThe processing is performed only on our behalf and based on our instructions for the purposes described.</p>\n<p>Please see below for an overview of our data processors:</p>9.1 Use of Google Analytics<p>Parts of our website and our mobile applications use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc.\n(\u201eGoogle\u201c).\nGoogle Analytics collects information about your use of this application, which is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.\nIf IP anonymisation is activated in this application, your IP address is truncated by Google beforehand within member states of the European Union or in other states that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nOnly in exceptional cases will the full address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there.\nGoogle uses this information on behalf of this application\u2019s operator to evaluate your use of the application, to compile reports about application activity and to provide further services relating to application and internet usage to the operator of this application.\nThe IP address sent by the application for the purposes of Google Analytics is not combined with other data from Google.\nIn mobile applications, you can deactivate the storage of usage information and the recording of data generated relating to your use of the application (including your IP address) by Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google in the application under \u201eMore\u201c -&gt.\n\u201eGoogle Analytics\u201c.</p>\n<p>\n<b>We draw your attention to the fact that, within this application, the code \u201ega(\u2019set\u2018,\u2019anonymizeIp\u2018, true);\u201c has been added to Google Analytics to ensure that IP addresses collected are anonymised (IP masking).</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can also disable the setting of cookies via your&nbsp;browser settings or download a corresponding browser plug-in.</p>\n<p>You can find more information

values for the use of our services.</p>\n<p>Anonymous measured values are collected.\nThis reach measurement method uses either a cookie with the identifier \u201eioam.de\u201c, \u201eivwbox.de\u201c, a local storage object or a signature created from various automatically transmitted browser information to recognise computer systems.\nIP addresses are only processed in anonymised form.</p>\n<p>This method of measuring reach was developed taking privacy into account.\nThe aim of the reach measurement process is to statistically calculate usage intensity and the number of users of a website.\nIndividual users are never identified.\nYour identity always remains protected.\nYou will not receive advertising via the system.\nFor websites that are members of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbetr\u00e4gern e.V.\n(IVW \u2013 http://www.ivw.eu) or take part in the \u201einternet facts\u201c study of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V.\n(AGOF \u2013 http://www.agof.de), usage statistics are published monthly by the AGOF and the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V.\n(ag.ma \u2013 http://www.agma-mmc.de), as well as the IVW, and can be viewed at&nbsp;http://www.agof.de&nbsp;,&nbsp;http://www.agma-mmc.de&nbsp;and&nbsp;http://www.ivw.eu.</p>\n<p>In addition to publishing measurement data, IVW regularly reviews the SCMS method to ensure usage in compliance with rules and data protection requirements.</p>\n<p>Further information on the SCMS can be found on the website of INFOnline GmbH (&nbsp;https://www.infonline.de&nbsp;), which operates the SCMS, the data protection website of AGOF (&nbsp;http://www.agof.de/datenschutz&nbsp;) and the data protection website of IVW

server technologies.\nThis is a service provided by DoubleClick, a company of Google Ireland Limited, Ireland.\nThe DoubleClick server enables us to control advertising.\nGoogle uses DoubleClick DART cookies for this purpose, which use information about user visits to the website and other websites, to display certain ads based on \u201efrequency capping\u201c.\nThis is a method of defining the frequency of advertisements based on standardised criteria.</p>\n<p>However, you may disable the use of DoubleClick DART cookies at any time.</p>\n<p>To do this, you will need to follow these instructions to deactivate cookies from Google:&nbsp;http://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin?hl=en-GB&nbsp;or&nbsp;https://adssettings.google.com/</p>\n<p>In addition to this, the DoubleClick DART cookies also enable \u201eclick fraud detection\u201c, which can exclude spam attacks and the illegal manipulation of Google server structures.\nFor this purpose, Google stores the IP addresses of the requesting server for a period of nine months.\nHowever, these IP addresses are only used for the purposes of fraud detection and are then permanently deleted.\nAdvertising analyses are not performed based on IP addresses.</p>\n<p>In addition, you can disable personalised Google advertising that is shown when you visit one of the more than two million websites whose operators cooperate with Google, as well as personalised advertising from over 100 other online advertising networks:</p>\n<p>http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices</p>\n<p>Click on the following links to

(OBA), is a technology that uses the anonymous collection and processing of your usage behaviour to enable advertising to be displayed that is optimised for you and targets your predicted interests.\nAs a user, you benefit from receiving advertising that is more likely to fit your interests and from the fact that less randomly distributed advertising is delivered.\nA cookie is stored on your computer to record your usage behaviour.\nCookies are small text files that are placed on your computer\u2019s hard drive and enable returning users to be recognised but do not enable you to be personally identified.</p>\n<p>They record information about your activities on our websites (e.g.\nbrowsing behaviour, sub-pages of our website visited, clicked advertising banners etc.).</p>\n<p>Since, in accordance with applicable law, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the collected data could be indirectly associated with an individual, all usage data is stored using a pseudonym, making personal identification almost impossible.\nThe IP address transmitted by your computer for technical reasons is anonymised/pseudonymised and is not used for the controlled display of advertising as described above.</p>\n<p>You can find more information on usage-based online advertising on the website of the European Advertising Standards Alliance (EASA):</p>\n<p>http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/about-behavioural-advertising</p>\n<p>If you no longer wish to receive usage-based ads, you can click on the following links to object to and disable the collection of data:</p>\n<p>http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices</p>10.1.1 MediaMarktSaturn / Salesforce DMP<p>As our partner, MediaMarktSaturn uses the \u201eSalesforce DMP\u201c technology of Salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str.\n31, 80636 Munich, Germany on this website.\nData is collected by setting cookies (krxd.net), i.e.\ntext files that are stored on your computer.\nThese data reflect the user\u2019s interaction with the website in order to be able to assess which advertisements may be of most interest to you.</p>\n<p>You can prevent this recording by Salesforce by clicking on the following link:</p>\n<p>Opt-out: https://www.salesforce.com/products/marketing-cloud/sfmc/salesforce-dmp-consumer-choice/?mc=DMP</p>\n<p>Please note that this setting must be made for each browser you use.\nIf all cookies in your browser are deleted, this also affects the opt-out cookie.</p>10.2 Tag-in-tag advertising<p>Nowadays, online advertising is often integrated via media agencies.\nThey represent a variety of advertisers.\nIn order to manage advertising materials centrally and control their display on publishers\u2018 sites (= our website), the media agency\u2019s own ad server is often used in addition to the publisher\u2019s ad server.\nThis process is called tag-in-tag placement.\nAs a result of this, personal data (e.g.\nIP addresses) is sometimes then processed or cookies set.</p>\n<p>We currently have agreements with the following agencies for the placement of online advertising.\nThese agencies are also obliged to comply with data protection regulations.\nIf you have no interest in these agencies processing your personal data or setting cookies, then the opt-out options described below are

personalised, i.e.\nusage-based online advertising is used, which is usually assigned and managed through an auction process.</p>\n<p>We currently use the following technology providers to manage programmatic advertising:</p>10.3.1 Yieldlab GmbHWhy are cookies from Yieldlab GmbH used?<p>Yieldlab uses cookies to adapt and optimise the display of advertising placed by Yieldlab\u2019s customers for the user.\nFor example, this affects the maximum frequency with which advertising is displayed to a user.\nIn some cases, Yieldlab also uses stored cookie information for statistical analyses.</p>Which data will be collected when Yieldlab cookies are set?<p>By setting cookies, Yieldlab does not store any personal data such as name, email addresses or other personal information.\nAll information is strictly anonymous and contains technical information, such as ad frequency and display date for advertising materials, the browser used or the operating system installed.</p>How does Yieldlab handle data protection?<p>Yieldlab operates all of its data collection processes in strict compliance with German data protection law.\nAll data is stored on servers within the Federal Republic of Germany.\nYieldlab also complies with all P3P requirements (Privacy Preferences Project).</p>\n<p>Further information can be found

web advertising service provided by Google Inc., USA (\u201eGoogle\u201c) places advertising (text ads, banners etc.) on this website, your browser may store cookies sent by Google Inc.\nor third parties.\nThe information stored in the cookie may be recorded, collected and analysed by Google Inc.\nor third parties.\nIn addition, Google Ad Exchange uses \u201eweb beacons\u201c (small invisible graphics) to collect information that can be used to record, collect and analyse simple actions such as user traffic on the website.</p>\n<p>The information generated by the cookie and/or web beacon about your use of this website is generally sent to and stored on a Google server in the US.\nGoogle uses the information received in this way to analyse your usage behaviour with respect to Google Ad Exchange ads.\nGoogle may also transfer this information to third parties if this is prescribed by law or if third parties process this data on Google\u2019s behalf.\nInsofar as IP addresses are transmitted and stored in this context, this is done only to combat and filter spam/fraud (ad impressions spam and click spam).\nAccess to this data is strictly limited to abuse prevention teams.\nGoogle will not associate the IP addresses with other data stored by Google.</p>\n<p>You can prevent the storage of cookies on your hard drive and the display of web beacons.\nTo do this, you need to select \u201edo not accept cookies\u201c in your&nbsp;browser settings.</p>\n<p>You can find further information at:&nbsp;https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/c</p> 11.\nLegal bases of data processing<p>The processing of your data for the purposes described above is based on the following legal bases:</p>Consent according to Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR:<p>This is when you have given your consent to the processing of your personal data for one or more specific purposes.</p>Contract fulfillment according to Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR:<p>Processing of your personal data is legal if it is necessary to fulfill a contract of which you are a party.\nThis also applies to the implementation of pre-contractual measures.</p>Legal obligation according to Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR:<p>If personal data processing is required to fulfill a legal obligation to which our company is subject, we are required to process your data.</p>Performaning a task of public interest according to Article

categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;</p>\n<p>(d) where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;</p>\n<p>(e) the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification

appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer.</p>\n<p>3.\nThe controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.\nFor any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.\nWhere the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data
