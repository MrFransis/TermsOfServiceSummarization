the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.&nbsp;We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.\nIf there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit&nbsp;https://www.privacyshield.gov/</p>\n<p>We are aware that, on July 16, 2020, in the Schrems II case, the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield as a means of ensuring adequate protection for personal data transferred to the US.\nWe are also aware that the Swiss Data Protection Authority and Information Commissioner invalidated the Swiss-US Privacy Shield in September 2020.\nIn reflection of these rulings, where we transfer personal data originating in the EEA or in Switzerland to the US, those transfers are made under the Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>\n<p>Auth0 is subject to
