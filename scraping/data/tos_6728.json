your spaces, and self-monitoring your statistics.</strong>\n</p> Section 1.\nInsertion Submissions.\n<p>You may submit a reservation for advertising space through the self-administered advertising portal for Ravelry to run advertisements (each reservation, a \u201cSubmission\u201d).\nAll Submissions must be submitted in a timely manner and according to the Advertising Submission Date Calendar,

terms of the applicable Submission.\nIn the event that your Submissions are not accepted by Ravelry, Ravelry will not be obligated to deliver any Ads (however, Ravelry does have the option of proposing alternative ad or location).\nIn each Submission, you will specify the amount and type of advertising that you are purchasing (e.g., impressions, clicks, duration or other desired actions or metrics with respect to the Ads) (the \u201cDeliverables\u201d).\nRavelry, in its sole discretion, may determine the positioning and any other aspects of the presentation of any Ads.\nScheduling of

Deliver and Makegoods/Remedies.</strong> If Ravelry fails to deliver any Deliverables in accordance with the terms of a Submission, you will not be responsible for payment for the days in which you Ads did not run.\nThis shall be your sole and exclusive remedy.\nRavelry will have no obligation to continue to deliver any such Ads after the term of the Submission if the Submission has been terminated by reason of your breach pursuant to Section 4.</p> Section 3.\nPayments and Reporting.\n<p>\n<strong>3.1 Payments.</strong> You will pay all amounts specified in an accepted Submission, along with any applicable taxes, in advance, by paying on the Billing History Tab of your Advertising Account via a Paypal account or credit card.\nYou are responsible for all charges related to the transaction.\nIf your payment method fails or your account is past due, Ravelry may collect past due amounts using other collection mechanisms, and you agree to pay all expenses associated with such collection, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your account (including your user name and password), and you understand that you will be charged for any orders placed by or through your account, even if such orders were not authorized by you.\nRavelry will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain the security or confidentiality of your account.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims against Ravelry related to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2 Cancellation.</strong> If you cancel any portion of a Submission pursuant to Section 4, you understand that the Ads will be removed immediately.\nYou will only be responsible for a fee for the actual days the Ads ran.</p> Section 4.\nTermination.\n<p>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and such breaching party does not cure the same within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from the non-breaching party.\nIn addition, you may cancel a Submission at any time through the online, self-service interface.\nSections 2.2 (Ad Content), 2.3 (Promotions), 2.6 (Failure to Deliver and Makegoods), 3 (Payments and Reporting), 4 (Termination),

Rights\u201d).\n(b) you have or will enter into a written agreement with Advertiser (i) that obtains Agency Rights.\n(ii) that binds the Advertiser to terms as protective of Ravelry as this Agreement

OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.\nRAVELRY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE RAVELRY INVENTORY OR ITS DELIVERY OF ADVERTISEMENTS HEREUNDER WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED OR CONTINUOUS.\nWITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, RAVELRY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR CLICK FRAUD OR OTHER IMPROPER ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES WHICH MAY AFFECT THE COST OF ADVERTISING.\nTHE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY IS A FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN HEREUNDER, AND THAT THE PARTIES WOULD NOT ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ABSENT SUCH DISCLAIMER.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3

Third Party Claim for which it seeks indemnification and will permit you to control the defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel chosen by you.\nprovided, that you will not enter into any settlement that contains any admission of or stipulation to any guilt, fault, liability or wrongdoing on the part of any Indemnified Party without Ravelry\u2019s prior written consent.</p> Section 10.\nLimitation of Liability.\n<p>RAVELRY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOST PROFITS OR OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, WARRANTY, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nIN NO EVENT WILL RAVELRY\u2019S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, TO RAVELRY DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DAY THE ACT OR OMISSION OCCURRED THAT GAVE RISE TO YOUR CLAIM.</p> Section 11.\nForce Majeure.\n<p>Excluding payment obligations, neither party will be liable for any delay or default in the performance of its obligations if such delay or default is caused by conditions beyond its reasonable control, including fire, flood, accident, earthquakes, telecommunications line failures, electrical outages, network failures or acts of God (collectively, \u201cForce Majeure\u201d).\nIf performance is delayed by more than 30 days as a result of any Force Majeure, either party will be entitled to terminate this Agreement by written notice delivered at any time prior to the other party\u2019s resumption of performance of this Agreement.</p> Section 12.\nDisputes.\n<p>The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern any dispute related to this Agreement or a Submission.\nYou agree that, except as otherwise provided for in this Section 12, all claims and disputes that arise out of or relate in any way to this Agreement or your placement of Ads on the Ravelry Inventory will be resolved by binding arbitration by a single arbitrator in Middlesex County, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nClaims for injunctive or other equitable relief may also be brought in a court of law.\nFor purposes of such relief or remedy, or any other court proceeding under this Section 12, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</p> Section 13.\nGeneral.\n<p>Except as specifically provided herein, if any portion of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and the court will construe any invalid or unenforceable portions in a manner that most closely reflects the effect and intent of the original language.\nIf such construction is not possible, the provision will be severed from this Agreement and the rest of the Agreement will remain in full force and effect.\nThe failure by either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of such party to enforce such provision thereafter.\nYou may not assign or otherwise transfer (including by any reorganization, change of control, merger, acquisition or sale or transfer of all or part of its assets or business) your rights or obligations under this Agreement including any Submission without the prior written permission of Ravelry, and in no event will Ravelry be obligated to serve Ads for any third party.\nRavelry may freely assign or otherwise transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement including any Submission, in whole or in part.\nAny purported assignment or other transfer in violation of this provision will be null and void.\nThis Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted respective successors and assigns.\nEach of Ravelry\u2019s affiliates are express and intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and may enforce any of its terms and exercise any of the rights to the same extent as Ravelry.\nYou and Ravelry are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement is intended to or does create any type of joint venture, partnership or employer/employee relationship between You and Ravelry or its affiliates.\nRavelry may provide effective notice to you by sending an email to the email address specified in your account, and the notice will be deemed received when sent.\nAny notices you send to Ravelry will be sent via courier or registered mail to Ravelry, LLC, 720 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, Attn: Legal Department, Ravelry Inc., and will be deemed received when such notice is received by Ravelry.\nWhenever used in this Agreement, unless otherwise specified, the terms \u201cincludes\u201d, \u201cincluding\u201d, \u201ce.g.,\u201d, \u201cfor
