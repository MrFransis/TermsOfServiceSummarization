provide you with information in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as well as to explain what information we collect, how we use data and what choices you have as a visitor to this website.</p>\n<p>Privacy policies usually sound very technical.\nHowever, this version should describe the most important things as simply and clearly as possible.\nMoreover, technical terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner whenever possible.\nWe would also like to convey that we only collect and use information via this website if there is a corresponding legal basis for it.\nThis is certainly not possible if you give very brief technical explanations, as are often standard on the Internet when it comes to data protection.\nWe hope you find the following explanations interesting and informative.\nMaybe you will also find some information that you did not know yet.<br>\nShould you still have questions, we kindly ask you to follow the existing links to see further information on third-party websites, or to simply write us an email.\nYou can find our contact information in our website\u2019s imprint.</p>\nAutomatic Data Retention\n<p>Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information is automatically created and stored, just as it happens on this website.\nThis data should be collected as sparingly as possible, and only with good reason.\nBy website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e.\neverything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here).\nBy domain we mean example.uk or examplepage.com.</p>\n<p>Even while you are currently visiting our website, our web server \u2013 this is the computer this website is stored on, usually automatically retains data such as the below \u2013 for reasons such as operational security or for creating access statistics etc.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the full address (URL) of the accessed website (e.\ng.\nhttps://www.examplepage.uk/examplesubpage.html/)</li>\n<li>browser and browser version (e.g.\nChrome 87)</li>\n<li>the operating system used (e.g.\nWindows 10)</li>\n<li>the address (URL) of the previously visited site (referrer URL) (z.\nB.\nhttps://www.examplepage.uk/icamefromhere.html/)</li>\n<li>the host name and the IP-address of the device the website is accessed from (e.g.\nCOMPUTERNAME and 194.23.43.121)</li>\n<li>date and time</li>\n<li>in so-called web server log files.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an illustration:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Generally, these files are stored for two weeks and are then automatically deleted.\nWe do not pass these data to others, but we cannot exclude the possibility that this data may be looked at by the authorities in case of illegal conduct.</p>\n<p>In short: your visit is logged by our provider (company that runs our website on servers), but we do not pass on your data!</p>\nCookies\n<p>Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.<br>\nFor your better understanding of the following Privacy Policy statement, we will explain to you below what cookies are and why they are in use.</p>\nWhat exactly are cookies?\n<p>Every time you surf the internet, you use a browser.\nCommon browsers are for example Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.\nMost websites store small text-files in your browser.\nThese files are called cookies.</p>\n<p>What should not be dismissed, is that cookies are very useful little helpers.\nNearly all websites use cookies.\nMore accurately speaking these are HTTP-cookies, since there are also different cookies for other uses.\nhttp-cookies are small files which our website stores on your computer.\nThese cookie files are automatically put into the cookie-folder, which is like the \u201cbrain\u201d of your browser.\nA cookie consists of a name and a value.\nMoreover, to define a cookie, one or multiple attributes must be specified.</p>\n<p>Cookies save certain parts of your user data, such as e.g.\nlanguage or personal page settings.\nWhen you re-open our website, your browser submits these \u201cuser specific\u201d information back to our site.\nThanks to cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to.\nIn some browsers every cookie has its own file, in others such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.</p>\n<p>There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies.\nFirst-party cookies are created directly by our site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g.\nGoogle Analytics).\nEvery cookie is individual, since every cookie stores different data.\nThe expiration time of a cookie also varies \u2013 it can be a few minutes, or up to a few years.\nCookies are no software-programs and contain no computer viruses, trojans or any other malware.\nCookies also cannot access your PC\u2019s information.</p>\n<p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>name:</strong> _ga<br>\n<strong>value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152121677243-9<br>\n<strong>purpose:</strong> differentiation between website visitors<br>\n<strong>expiration date:</strong> after 2 years</p>\n<p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>at least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>\n<li>at least 50 cookies per domain</li>\n<li>at least 3000 cookies in total</li>\n</ul>\nWhich types of cookies are there?\n<p>What exact cookies we use, depends on the used services.\nWe will explain this in the following sections of the Privacy Policy statement.\nFirstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.</p>\n<p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential Cookies<br>\n</strong>These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic function of a website.\nThey are needed when a user for example puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in order to proceed to the checkout.\nEven when the user closed their window priorly, these cookies ensure that the shopping cart does not get deleted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Purposive Cookies<br>\n</strong>These cookies collect info about the user behaviour and record if the user potentially receives any error messages.\nFurthermore, these cookies record the website\u2019s loading time as well as its behaviour within different browsers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Target-orientated Cookies<br>\n</strong>These cookies care for an improved user-friendliness.\nThus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts or data in forms stay saved.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising Cookies<br>\n</strong>These cookies are also known as targeting-Cookies.\nThey serve the purpose of delivering individually adapted advertisements to the user.\nThis can be very practical, but also rather annoying.</p>\n<p>Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept.\nFurthermore, this decision will of course also be saved in a cookie.</p>\nHow can I delete cookies?\n<p>You yourself take the decision if and how you want to use cookies.\nThus, no matter what service or website cookies are from, you always have the option to delete, deactivate or only partially allow them.\nTherefore, you can for example block cookies of third parties but allow any other cookies.</p>\n<p>If you want change or delete cookie-settings and would like to determine which cookies have been saved to your browser, you can find this info in your browser-settings:</p>\n<p> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </p>\n<p> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </p>\n<p> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </p>\n<p> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </p>\n<p> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </p>\n<p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser in a way, to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set.\nThis gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie.\nThe settings for this differ from browser to browser.\nTherefore, it might be best for you to search for the instructions in Google.\nIf you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search phrase \u201cdelete cookies Chrome\u201d or \u201cdeactivate cookies Chrome\u201d into Google.</p>\nHow is my data protected?\n<p>There is a \u201ccookie policy\u201d that has been in place since 2009.\nIt states that the storage of cookies requires the user\u2019s consent.\nHowever, among the countries of the EU, these guidelines are often met with mixed reactions.\nIn Austria the guidelines have been implemented in \u00a7 96 section 3 of the Telecommunications Act (TKG).</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called \u201cHTTP State Management Mechanism\u201d.</p>\nStorage of Personal Data\n<p>Any personal data you electronically submit to us on this website, such as your name, email address, home address or other personal information you provide via the transmission of a form or via any comments to the blog, are solely used for the specified purpose and get stored securely along with the respective submission times and IP-address.\nThese data do not get passed on to third parties.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we use personal data for the communication with only those users, who have explicitly requested being contacted, as well as for the execution of the services and products offered on this website.\nWe do not pass your personal data to others without your approval, but we cannot exclude the possibility this data will be looked at in case of illegal conduct.</p>\n<p>If you send us personal data via email \u2013 and thus not via this website \u2013 we cannot guarantee any safe transmission or protection of your data.\nWe recommend you, to never send confidential data via email.</p>\nRights in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation\n<p>You are granted the following rights in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>right to rectification (article 16 GDPR)</li>\n<li>right to erasure (\u201cright to be forgotten\u201c) (article 17 GDPR)</li>\n<li>right to restrict processing (article 18 GDPR)</li>\n<li>righ to notification \u2013 notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing (article 19 GDPR)</li>\n<li>right to data portability (article 20 GDPR)</li>\n<li>Right to object (article 21 GDPR)</li>\n<li>right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing \u2013 including profiling \u2013 (article 22 GDPR)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think that the processing of your data violates the data protection law, or that your data protection rights have been infringed in any other way, you can lodge a complaint with your respective regulatory authority.\nFor Austria this is the data protection authority, whose website you can access at https://www.data-protection-authority.gv.at/.</p>\nEvaluation of Visitor Behaviour\n<p>In the following Privacy Policy, we will inform you on if and how we evaluate the data of your visit to this website.\nThe evaluation is generally made anonymously, and we cannot link to you personally based on your behaviour on this website.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about how to disagree with the evaluation of visitor data, in the Privacy Policy below.</p>\nTLS encryption with https\n<p>The terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed.\nWe use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.<br>\nThis means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured \u2013 nobody can \u201clisten in\u201d.</p>\n<p>We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design Article 25 Section 1 GDPR).\nWith the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.<br>\nYou can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol , which is situated in your browser\u2019s top left corner in the left of the internet address (e.g.\nexamplepage.uk), as well as by the display of the letters https (instead of http) as a part of our web address.<br>\nIf you want to know more about encryption, we recommend you to do a Google search for \u201cHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure wiki\u201d to find good links to further information.</p>\nGoogle Fonts Privacy Policy\n<p>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc.\n(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).</p>\n<p>To use Google Fonts, you must log in and set up a password.\nFurthermore, no cookies will be saved in your browser.\nThe data (CSS, Fonts) will be requested via the Google domains fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com.\nAccording to Google, all requests for CSS and fonts are fully separated from any other Google services.\nIf you have a Google account, you do not need to worry that your Google account details are transmitted to Google while you use Google Fonts.\nGoogle records the use of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as well as the utilised fonts and stores these data securely.\nWe will have a detailed look at how exactly the data storage works.</p>\nWhat are Google Fonts?\n<p>Google Fonts (previously Google Web Fonts) is a list of over 800 fonts which href=\u201dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google?tid=121677243\u201d&gt;Google LLC provides its users for free.</p>\n<p>Many of these fonts have been published under the SIL Open Font License license, while others have been published under the Apache license.\nBoth are free software licenses.</p>\nWhy do we use Google Fonts on our website?\n<p>With Google Fonts we can use different fonts on our website and do not have to upload them to our own server.\nGoogle Fonts is an important element which helps to keep the quality of our website high.\nAll Google fonts are automatically optimised for the web, which saves data volume and is an advantage especially for the use of mobile terminal devices.\nWhen you use our website, the low data size provides fast loading times.\nMoreover, Google Fonts are secure Web Fonts.\nVarious image synthesis systems (rendering) can lead to errors in different browsers, operating systems and mobile terminal devices.\nThese errors could optically distort parts of texts or entire websites.\nDue to the fast Content Delivery Network (CDN) there are no cross-platform issues with Google Fonts.\nAll common browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera) are supported by Google Fonts, and it reliably operates on most modern mobile operating systems, including Android 2.2+ and iOS 4.2+ (iPhone, iPad, iPod).\nWe also use Google Fonts for presenting our entire online service as pleasantly and as uniformly as possible.</p>\nWhich data is saved by Google?\n<p>Whenever you visit our website, the fonts are reloaded by a Google server.\nThrough this external cue, data gets transferred to Google\u2019s servers.\nTherefore, this makes Google recognise that you (or your IP-address) is visiting our website.\nThe Google Fonts API was developed to reduce the usage, storage and gathering of end user data to the minimum needed for the proper depiction of fonts.\nWhat is more, API stands for \u201eApplication Programming Interface\u201c and works as a software data intermediary.</p>\n<p>Google Fonts stores CSS and font requests safely with Google, and therefore it is protected.\nUsing its collected usage figures, Google can determine how popular the individual fonts are.\nGoogle publishes the results on internal analysis pages, such as Google Analytics.\nMoreover, Google also utilises data of ist own web crawler, in order to determine which websites are using Google fonts.\nThis data is published in Google Fonts\u2019 BigQuery database.\nEnterpreneurs and developers use Google\u2019s webservice BigQuery to be able to inspect and move big volumes of data.</p>\n<p>One more thing that should be considered, is that every request for Google Fonts automatically transmits information such as language preferences, IP address, browser version, as well as the browser\u2019s screen resolution and name to Google\u2019s servers.\nIt cannot be clearly identified if this data is saved, as Google has not directly declared it.</p>\nHow long and where is the data stored?\n<p>Google saves requests for CSS assets for one day in a tag on their servers, which are primarily located outside of the EU.\nThis makes it possible for us to use the fonts by means of a Google stylesheet.\nWith the help of a stylesheet, e.g.\ndesigns or fonts of a website can get changed swiftly and easily.</p>\n<p>Any font related data is stored with Google for one year.\nThis is because Google\u2019s aim is to fundamentally boost websites\u2019 loading times.\nWith millions of websites referring to the same fonts, they are buffered after the first visit and instantly reappear on any other websites that are visited thereafter.\nSometimes Google updates font files to either reduce the data sizes, increase the language coverage or to improve the design.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent it being stored?\n<p>The data Google stores for either a day or a year cannot be deleted easily.\nUpon opening the page this data is automatically transmitted to Google.\nIn order to clear the data ahead of time, you have to contact Google\u2019s support at https://support.google.com/?hl=en-GB&amp;tid=121677243.\nThe only way for you to prevent the retention of your data is by not visiting our website.</p>\n<p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts.\nThus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website.\nYou can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=121677243.\nWhile Google does address relevant elements on data protection at this link, it does not contain any detailed information on data retention.<br>\nIt proofs rather difficult to receive any precise information on stored data by Google.</p>\n<p>On https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB you can read more about what data is generally collected by Google and what this data is used for.</p>\nGoogle Fonts Local Privacy Policy\n<p>On our website we use Google Fonts, from the company Google Inc.\n(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).<br>\nWe integrated Google Fonts locally, so on our own webserver and not on Google\u2019s servers.\nHence, there is no connection to Google\u2019s servers and consequently no data transfer or retention.</p>\nWhat are Google Fonts?\n<p>Google Fonts was previously called Google Web Fonts.\nIt is an interactive list with over 800 fonts which Google LLC offer for free use.\nWith the use of Google Fonts, it is possible to utilise fonts without uploading them to your own server.\nFor that matter, in order to prevent any transfer of information to Google\u2019s servers, we downloaded the fonts to our own server.\nThis way we comply with the data privacy and do not transmit any data to Google Fonts.</p>\n<p>Unlike other web fonts, Google offers us unrestricted access to all its fonts.\nThus, we have a vast sea of font types at our disposal, which helps us to get the most out of our website.\nYou can find out more answers and information on Google Fonts at https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?tid=121677243.</p>\nFont Awesome Privacy Policy\n<p>On our website we use Font Awesome by the American company Fonticons (307 S.\nMain St., Suite 202, Bentonville, AR 72712, USA).\nUpon your visit to one of our websites, the Font Awesome web font, i.e.\nthe icons, are loaded via the Font Awesome Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nThis way texts, fonts and icons are displayed appropriately on every device.\nIn this privacy policy we will go into more detail on data storage and data processing by this service.</p>\nWhat is Font Awesome?\n<p>Icons play an increasingly important role on websites.\nFont Awesome is a web font specifically designed for web designers and web developers.\nWith Font Awesome icons can for example be scaled and coloured as desired using the CSS stylesheet language.\nThus, they now replace old picture icons.\nFont Awesome CDN is the easiest way to load icons or fonts onto your website.\nTo do this, we only had to embed a short line of code into our website.</p>\nWhy do we use Font Awesome on our website?\n<p>Font Awesome enables our websites\u2019 content to be depicted better.\nThis eases your navigation on our website, and helps you grasp its content better.\nThe icons can sometimes even be used to replace whole words and save space.\nThis is particularly useful when optimising content specifically for smartphones.\nThe icons are inserted as HMTL code instead of as an image, which allows us to edit the icons with CSS exactly as we want.\nSimultaneously, Font Awesome also lets us improve our loading speed, as it only contains HTML elements and no icon images.\nAll these advantages help us to make our website even clearer, faster and more refined for you.</p>\nWhich data are stored by Font Awesome?\n<p>The Font Awesome Content Delivery Network (CDN) is used to load icons and symbols.\nCDNs are networks of servers that are distributed around the world.\nThey make it possible to quickly load files from locations in close proximity.\nWhen you open one of our pages, the respective icons will be provided by Font Awesome.</p>\n<p>For the web fonts to be loaded, your browser has to connect to the servers of Fonticons, Inc.\nFor this, your IP address will be identified.\nFont Awesome also collects data on which icon files are downloaded, as well as when they are downloaded.\nFurthermore, technical data such as your browser version, screen resolution or the time when you accessed the page are also transmitted.</p>\n<p>These data are collected and stored for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to optimise Content Delivery Networks</li>\n<li>to identify and fix technical errors</li>\n<li>to protect CDNs from misuse and attacks</li>\n<li>to calculate fees from Font Awesome Pro customers</li>\n<li>to identify the popularity of icons</li>\n<li>to establish which computer and software you are using</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your browser does not allow web fonts, one of your PC\u2019s standard fonts will be used automatically.\nMoreover, as far as we are currently aware, no cookies will be set.\nWe are keeping in contact with Font Awesome\u2019s privacy department and will let you know as soon as we find out more.</p>\nHow long and where are the data stored?\n<p>Font Awesome stores data about the use of the Content Delivery Network also on servers in the United States of America.\nHowever, the CDN servers are located all across the world and store user data in your proximity.\nThe data is usually only stored for a few weeks in an identifiable form.\nAggregated statistics on the use of the CDNs may also be stored for longer.\nHowever, these do not include any personal data.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>As far as we are aware, Font Awesome does not store any personal data via Content Delivery Networks.\nIf you do not want data about the used icons to be stored, you will unfortunately not be able to visit our website.\nIf your browser does not allow web fonts, no data will be transmitted or saved.\nIn this case your computer\u2019s default font will be used.</p>\n<p>If you want to find out more about Font Awesome and their data handling, we recommend you to read their privacy policy at https://fontawesome.com/privacy along with the help page at https://fontawesome.com/help.</p>\nOpenStreetMap Privacy Policy\n<p>We have included map sections of the online map tool \u201cOpenStreetMap\u201d to our website.\nIt is a so-called open source mapping, which we can access via an API (interface).\nThis feature is offered by OpenStreetMap Foundation, St John\u2019s Innovation Center, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom.\nBy using this map function, your IP address will be forwarded to OpenStreetMap.\nIn this privacy policy we will explain why we use the functions of the OpenStreetMap tool, where which data is stored and how you can prevent data storage.</p>\nWhat is OpenStreetMap?\n<p>The OpenStreetMap project was launched in 2004.\nIts aim is to create a free world map.\nUsers all around the world have been collecting data about buildings, forests, rivers and roads.\nTherefore, an extensive digital world map has been created by users over the years.\nOf course, the map is not complete, but it contains a lot of data for most regions.</p>\nWhy do we use OpenStreetMap on our website?\n<p>The primary intention of your website is to be helpful to you.\nWe think this can only be the case when information can be found quickly and easily.\nOn the one hand, of course, this concerns our services and products.\nOn the other hand, there should also be other helpful information available to you.\nThat is why we also use OpenStreetMap\u2019s map service.\nThanks to this, we can for example show you exactly how to find our company.\nThe map shows you the best way to get to us and makes your journey very smooth and easy.</p>\nWhat data is stored by OpenStreetMap?\n<p>When you visit one of our websites that include OpenStreetMap, your user data is transmitted to the service where it is stored.\nOpenStreetMap collects information about your interactions with the digital map, your IP address, your browser, device type, operating system and on which day and at what time you used the service.\nTracking software is also used to record user interactions.\nFor this regard, the company specifiies the \u201cPiwik\u201d analysis tool in its own privacy policy.</p>\n<p>The collected data are then accessible to the relevant employee groups of the OpenStreetMap Foundation.\nAccording to the company, personal data will not be passed on to other people or companies, unless it is legally required.\nThe third-party provider Piwik stores your IP address, but in a shortened form.</p>\n<p>The following cookies may be set in your browser if you inerace with OpenStreetMap on our website:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _osm_location<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 9.63312%7C52.41500%7C17%7CM<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie is required to unlock OpenStreetMap\u2019s contents.<br>\n<strong>Ablaufdatum:</strong> after 10 years</p>\n<p>If you want to view the map in full screen, you will be linked to OpenStreetMap\u2019s website.\nThere, the following cookies may be stored in your browser:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _osm_totp_token<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 148253121677243-2<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong>This cookie is used to ensure the operation of the map section.<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong>after one hour</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _osm_session<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 1d9bfa122e0259d5f6db4cb8ef653a1c<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> With the help of this cookie, session information (i.e.\nuser behavior) can be stored.<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after end of session</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _pk_id.1.cf09<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 4a5.1593684142.2.1593688396.1593688396121677243-9<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong>This cookie is set by Piwik to save or measure user data such as click behavior.<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after one year</p>\nHow long and where are the data stored?\n<p>The API servers, databases, and servers of auxiliary services are currently located in the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and the Netherlands.\nYour IP address and user information, which are saved in an abbreviated version by the web analysis tool Piwik, will be deleted after 180 days.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>You have the right to both access your personal data and to object to its use and processing at any time.\nYou can also always manage, delete, or deactivate cookies that may be set by OpenStreetMap in your browser.\nAs a result, however, the service may no longer work to their full extent.\nThe management, deletion or deactivation of cookies works differently in every browser.\nBelow you will find links to the instructions of the most popular browsers:</p>\n<p> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </p>\n<p> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </p>\n<p> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </p>\n<p> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </p>\n<p>

Floor, District of Columbia 20005, USA.\nMapbox is an online map tool (open source mapping) that is accessed via an interface (API).\nWhen using this tool, your IP address will be forwarded to Mapbox, where it will be stored.\nIn this privacy policy you will find out more on the functions of the tool as well as to why we use it.\nAbove all, you will get more details on which of your data is stored and how you can prevent this.</p>\nWhat is Mapbox API?\n<p>Mapbox is an American software company that offers custom online maps for websites.\nFor example, Mapbox allows us to illustrate content on our website or to display directions graphically.\nSpecific small code snippets (JavaScript code) make the integration of maps to our website very easy.\nWhat is more, among other things Mapbox offers a mobile-friendly environment, visualises data and provides route information in real time.</p>\nWhy do we use Mapbox API on our website?\n<p>We strongly believe that the comprehensive service we offer with our products and services should also extend to our website.\nIn fact, we want all our content to be of use to you.\nOf course this also includes maps that show you the way to our business.</p>\nWhat data are stored by Mapbox API?\n<p>If you open one of our subpages containing an online map by Mapbox, data about your user behaviour may be collected and stored.\nThis is essential for the integrated online maps to work properly.\nMoreover, Mapbox may pass on the collected data (excluding personal data) to third parties.\nThis may happen either if the data transfer is necessary for legal reasons, or if Mapbox explicitly instructs another company to do so.\nAny map contents are transmitted directly to your browser and thus integrated into our website.</p>\n<p>Mapbox automatically collects certain technical information when requests are made to the APIs.\nThis includes your IP address, browser information, your operating system, the request\u2019s content, restricted location and usage data, the URL of the website you visited and the date and time of your website visit.\nAccording to Mapbox, this data is only used to improve their own products.\nMapbox also collects randomly generated IDs in order to analyse user behaviour and determine the number of active users.</p>\n<p>If you use one of our subpages and interact with an online map, Mapbox will set the following cookie in your browser:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> ppcbb-enable-content-mapbox_js<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 1605795587121677243-4<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> We have not yet been able to find out more detailed information about the purpose of this cookie.<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after one year</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> In our tests we did not find any cookie in the Chrome browser, however, we did find it in other browsers.</p>\nWhere and how long are data stored?\n<p>The collected data is stored and processed on American servers which are operated by Mapbox.\nFor security reasons, your IP address is stored for 30 days, after which it is deleted.\nRandomly generated IDs (no personal data) that analyse the use of the APIs are deleted after 36 months.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>If you do not want Mapbox to process data about you or your user behaviour, you can deactivate JavaScript in your browser settings.\nOf course, you will then no longer be able to use all functions to their full extent.</p>\n<p>You reserve the right to access your personal data at any time, as well as to object to them being used and processed.\nAny cookies that the Mapbox API may set can be managed, deleted or deactivated in your browser at any time.\nHowever, this may prevent the service from working properly.\nThe process of managing, deleting or deactivating cookies works a little differently for each browser.\nBelow you will find links to the instructions for the most popular browsers:</p>\n<p> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </p>\n<p> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </p>\n<p> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </p>\n<p> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </p>\n<p> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about Mapbox\u2019s data processing, we recommend you to read the company\u2019s privacy policy at https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy.</p>\nGoogle Analytics Privacy Policy\n<p>We use the tracking and analysis tool Google Analytics (GA) of the US-American company Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).\nGoogle Analytics collects data on your actions on our website.\nWhenever you click a link for example, this action is saved in a cookie and transferred to Google Analytics.\nWith the help of reports which we receive from Google Analytics, we can adapt our website and our services better to your wishes.\nIn the following, we will explain the tracking tool in more detail, and most of all, we will inform you what data is saved and how you can prevent this.</p>\nWhat is Google Analytics?\n<p>Google Analytics is a tracking tool with the purpose of conducting data traffic analysis of our website.\nFor Google Analytics to work, there is a tracking code integrated to our website.\nUpon your visit to our website, this code records various actions you perform on your website.\nAs soon as you leave our website, this data is sent to the Google Analytics server, where it is stored.</p>\n<p>Google processes this data and we then receive reports on your user behaviour.\nThese reports can be one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target audience reports: With the help of target audience reports we can get to know our users better and can therefore better understand who is interested in our service.</li>\n<li>Advertising reports: Through advertising reports we can analyse our online advertising better and hence improve it.</li>\n<li>Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide us helpful information on how we can get more people enthusiastic about our service.</li>\n<li>Behaviour reports: With these reports, we can find out how you interact with our website.\nBy the means of behaviour reports, we can understand what path you go on our website and what links you click.</li>\n<li>Conversion reports: A conversion is the process of leading you to carry out a desired action due to a marketing message.\nAn example of this would be transforming you from a mere website visitor into a buyer or a newsletter subscriber.\nHence, with the help of these reports we can see in more detail, if our marketing measures are successful with you.\nOur aim is to increase our conversion rate.</li>\n<li>Real time reports: With the help of these reports we can see in real time, what happens on our website.\nIt makes us for example see, we can see how many users are reading this text right now.</li>\n</ul>\nWhy do we use Google Analytics on our website?\n<p>The objective of our website is clear: We want to offer you the best possible service.\nGoogle Analytics\u2019 statistics and data help us with reaching this goal.</p>\n<p>Statistically evaluated data give us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website.\nOn the one hand, we can optimise our page in a way, that makes it easier to be found by interested people on Google.\nOn the other hand, the data helps us to get a better understanding of you as our visitor.\nTherefore, we can very accurately find out what we must improve on our website, in order to offer you the best possible service.\nThe analysis of that data also enables us to carry out our advertising and marketing measures in a more individual and more cost-effective way.\nAfter all, it only makes sense to show our products and services exclusively to people who are interested in them.</p>\nWhat data gets stored by Google Analytics?\n<p>With the aid of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID which is connected to your browser cookie.\nThat way, Google Analytics recognises you as a new user.\nThe next time you visit our site, you will be recognised as a \u201crecurring\u201d user.\nAll data that is collected gets saved together with this very user ID.\nOnly this is how it is made possible for us to evaluate and analyse pseudonymous user profiles.</p>\n<p>Your interactions on our website are measures by tags such as cookies and app instance IDs.\nInteractions are all kinds of actions that you perform on our website.\nIf you are also using other Google systems (such as a Google Account), data generated by Google Analytics can be linked with third-party cookies.\nGoogle does not pass on any Google Analytics data, unless we as the website owners authorise it.\nIn case it is required by law, exceptions can occur.</p>\n<p>The following cookies are used by Google Analytics:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _ga<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong>2.1326744211.152121677243-5<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> By deafault, analytics.js uses the cookie _ga, to save the user ID.\nIt generally serves the purpose of differenciating between website visitors.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> After 2 years</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _gid<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong>2.1687193234.152121677243-1<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie also serves the purpose of differentiating between website users<br>\n<strong>Expiration

Google Analytics is provided via Google Tag Manager, this cookie gets the name _dc_gtm_ .<br>\n<strong>Expiration date: </strong>After 1 minute</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> AMP_TOKEN<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> No information<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie has a token which is used to retrieve the user ID by the AMP Client ID Service.\nOther possible values suggest a logoff, a request or an error.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> After 30 seconds up to one year</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> __utma<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong>1564498958.1564498958.1564498958.1<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> With this cookie your behaviour on the website can be tracked and the site performance can be measured.\nThe cookie is updated every time the information is sent to Google Analytics.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> After 2 years</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> __utmt<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 1<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> Just like _gat_gtag_UA_ this cookie is used for keeping the requirement rate in check.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> Afer

167421564<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie is used to determine new sessions for recurring visitors.\nIt is therefore a session cookie, and only stays saved until you close the browser again.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> After closing the browser</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> __utmz<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> m|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie is used to identify the source of our website\u2019s visitor number.\nThis means, that the cookie saves information on where you came to our website from.\nThis could be another site or an advertisement.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> After 6 months</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> __utmv<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> No information<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> The cookie is used to store custom user data.\nIt gets updated whenever information is sent to Google Analytics.<br>\n<strong>Expiration date:</strong> After 2 years</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> This list is by no means exhaustive, since Google are repeatedly changing the use of their cookies.</p>\n<p>Below we will give you an overview of the most important data that can be evaluated by Google Analytics:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates so-called Heatmaps an.\nThese Heatmaps make it possible to see the exact areas you click on, so we can get information on what routes you make on our website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Session duration:</strong> Google calls the time you spend on our website without leaving it session duration.\nWhenever you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session ends automatically.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bounce rate</strong> If you only look at one page of our website and then leave our website again, it is called a bounce.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account creation:</strong> If you create an account or make an order on our website, Google Analytics collects this data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IP-Address:</strong> The IP address is only shown in a shortened form, to make it impossible to clearly allocate it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location:</strong> Your approximate location and the country you are in can be defined by the IP address.\nThis process is called IP location determination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical information:</strong> Information about your browser type, your internet provider and your screen resolution are called technical information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Source:</strong> Both, Google Analytics as well as ourselves, are interested what website or what advertisement led you to our site.</p>\n<p>Further possibly stored data includes contact data, potential reviews, playing media (e.g.\nwhen you play a video on our site), sharing of contents via social media or adding our site to your favourites.\nThis list is not exhaustive and only serves as general guidance on Google Analytics\u2019 data retention.</p>\nHow long and where is the data saved?\n<p>Google has servers across the globe.\nMost of them are in America and therefore your data is mainly saved on American servers.\nHere you can read detailed information on where Google\u2019s data centres are located: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en\n</p>\n<p>Your data is allocated to various physical data mediums.\nThis has the advantage of allowing to retrieve the data faster, and of protecting it better from manipulation.\nEvery Google data centre has respective emergency programs for your data.\nHence, in case of a hardware failure at Google or a server error due to natural disasters, the risk for a service interruption stays relatively low.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics has a 26 months standardised period of retaining your user data.\nAfter this time, your user data is deleted.\nHowever, we have the possibility to choose the retention period of user data ourselves.\nThere are the following five options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deletion after 14 months</li>\n<li>Deletion after 26 months</li>\n<li>Deletion after 38 months</li>\n<li>Deletion after 50 months</li>\n<li>No automatical deletion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As soon as the chosen period is expired, the data is deleted once a month.\nThis retention period applies to any of your data which is linked to cookies, user identification and advertisement IDs (e.g.\ncookies of the DoubleClick domain).\nAny report results are based on aggregated information and are stored independently of any user data.\nAggregated information is a merge of individual data into a single and bigger unit.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>Under the provisions of the European Union\u2019s data protection law, you have the right to obtain information on your data and to update, delete or restrict it.\nWith the help of a browser add on that can deactivate Google Analytics\u2019 JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js), you can prevent Google Analytics from using your data.\nYou can download this add on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB.\nPlease consider that this add on can only deactivate any data collection by Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>Should you generally want to deactivate, delete or manage all cookies (independently of Google Analytics), you can use one of the guides that are available for any browser:</p>\n<p> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </p>\n<p> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </p>\n<p> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </p>\n<p> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </p>\n<p> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </p>\n<p>Google Analytics is an active participant of the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, which regulates correct and save transfer of personal data.<br>\nYou can find more information on this at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;tid=121677243.\nWe hope we were able to make you more familiar with the most important information on Google Analytics\u2019 data processing.\nIf you want to learn more about the tracking service, we recommend both of the following links: https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/gb/ and https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en.</p>\nGoogle Analytics IP Anonymisation\n<p>We implemented Google Analytics\u2019 IP address anonymisation to this website.\nGoogle developed this function, so this website can comply with the applicable privacy laws and the local data protection authorities\u2019 recommendations, should they prohibit the retention of any full IP addresses.<br>\nThe anonymisation or masking of IP addresses takes place, as soon as they reach Google Analytics\u2019 data collection network, but before the data would be saved or processed.</p>\n<p>You can find more information on IP anonymisation at https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en.</p>\nGoogle Analytics Reports on demographic characteristics and interests\n<p>We have turned on Google Analytics\u2019 functions for advertising reports.\nThese reports on demographic characteristics and interests contain details about age, gender and interests.\nThrough them we can get a better picture of our users \u2013 without being able to allocate any data to individual persons.\nYou can learn more about advertising functions at auf https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3450482?hl=en&amp;%3Butm_id=ad.</p>\n<p>You can terminate the use of your Google Account\u2019s activities and information in \u201cAds Settings\u201d at https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated via a checkbox.</p>\nGoogle Analytics Deactivation Link\n<p>By clicking on the following <strong>deactivation link</strong> you can prevent Google from tracking your further visits.\nCaution: The deletion of cookies, the use of your browser\u2019s incognito/private mode or the use of a different browser may lead to your data being collected again.</p>\n<p>\nDeactivate Google Analytics\n</p>\nGoogle Analytics\u2018 Data Processing Amendment\n<p>By accepting the amendment on data processing in Google Analytics, we entered a contract with Google concerning the use of Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>You can find out more about the amendment on data processing for Google Analytics here: https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3379636?hl=en&amp;utm_id=ad\n</p>\nGoogle Analytics Google Signals Privacy Policy\n<p>We have activated Google signals in Google Analytics.\nThrough this, any existing Google Analytics functions (advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reports and reports on interests and demographic characteristics) are updated, to result in the summary and anonymisation of your data, should you have permitted personalised ads in your Google Account.</p>\n<p>The special aspect of this is that it involves cross-device tracking.\nThat means your data can be analysed across multiple devices.\nThrough the activation of Google signals, data is collected and linked to the Google account.\nFor example, it enables Google to recognise when you look at a product on a smartphone and later buy the product on a laptop.\nDue to activating Google signals, we can start cross-device remarketing campaigns, which would otherwise not be possible to this extent.\nRemarketing means, that we can show you our products and services across other websites as well.</p>\n<p>Moreover, further visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history and data about your actions on our website are collected in Google Analytics.\nAs a result, we receive improved advertising reports and more useful information on your interests and demographic characteristics.\nThese include your age, the language you speak, where you live or what your gender is.\nCertain social criteria such as your job, your marital status or your income are also included.\nAll these characteristics help Google Analytics to define groups of persons or target audiences.</p>\n<p>Those reports also help us to better assess your behaviour, as well as your wishes and interests.\nAs a result, we can optimise and customise our products and services for you.\nBy default, this data expires after 26 months.\nPlease consider, that this data is only collected if you have agreed to personalised advertisement in your Google Account.\nThe retained information is always exclusively summarised and anonymous data, and never any data on individual persons.\nYou can manage or delete this data in your Google Account.</p>\nGoogle Tag Manager Privacy Policy\n<p>We use Google Tag Manager by the company Google Inc.\n(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) for our website.<br>\nThis Tag Manager is one of Google\u2019s many helpful marketing products.\nWith it, we can centrally integrate and manage code sections of various tracking tools, that we use on our website.</p>\n<p>In this privacy statement we will explain in more detail, what Google Tag Manager does, why we use it and to what extent your data is processed.</p>\nWhat is Google Tag Manager?\n<p>Google Tag Manager is an organising tool with which we can integrate and manage website tags centrally and via a user interface.\nTags are little code sections which e.g.\ntrack your activities on our website.\nFor this, segments of JavaScript code are integrated to our site\u2019s source text.\nThe tags often come from Google\u2019s intern products, such as Google Ads or Google Analytics, but tags from other companies can also be integrated and managed via the manager.\nSince the tags have different tasks, they can collect browser data, feed marketing tools with data, embed buttons, set cookies and track users across several websites.</p>\nWhy do we use Google Tag Manager for our website?\n<p>Everybody knows: Being organised is important! Of course, this also applies to maintenance of our website.\nIn order to organise and design our website as well as possible for you and anyone who is interested in our products and services, we rely on various tracking tools, such as Google Analytics.<br>\nThe collected data shows us what interests you most, which of our services we should improve, and which other persons we should also display our services to.\nFurthermore, for this tracking to work, we must implement relevant JavaScript Codes to our website.\nWhile we could theoretically integrate every code section of every tracking tool separately into our source text, this would take too much time and we would lose overview.\nThis is the reason why we use Google Tag Manager.\nWe can easily integrate the necessary scripts and manage them from one place.\nAdditionally, Google Tag Manager\u2019s user interface is easy to operate, and requires no programming skills.\nTherefore, we can easily keep order in our jungle of tags.</p>\nWhat data is saved by Google Tag Manager?\n<p>Tag Manager itself is a domain that neither uses cookies nor stores data.\nIt merely functions as an \u201cadministrator\u201c of implemented tags.\nData is collected by the individual tags of the different web analysis tools.\nTherefore, in Google Tag Manager the data is sent to the individual tracking tools and does not get saved.</p>\n<p>However, with the integrated tags of different web analysis tools such as Google Analytics, this is quite different.\nDepending on the analysis tool used, various data on your internet behaviour is collected, stored and processed with the help of cookies.\nPlease read our texts on data protection for more information on the articular analysis and tracking tools we use on our website.</p>\n<p>We allowed Google via the account settings for the Tag Manager to receive anonymised data from us.\nHowever, this exclusively refers to the use of our Tag Manager and not to your data, which are saved via code sections.\nWe allow Google and others, to receive selected data in anonymous form.\nTherefore, we agree to the anonymised transfer of our website data.\nHowever, even after extensive research we could not find out what summarised and anonymous data it is exactly that gets transmitted.\nWhat we do know is that Google deleted any info that could identify our website.\nGoogle combines the data with hundreds of other anonymous website data and creates user trends as part of benchmarking measures.\nBenchmarking is a process of comparing a company\u2019s results with the ones of competitors.\nAs a result, processes can be optimised based on the collected information.</p>\nHow long and where is the data saved?\n<p>When Google stores data, this is done on Google\u2019s own servers.\nThese servers are located all over the world, with most of them being in America.\nAt https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/locations/?hl=en you can read in detail where Google\u2019s servers are.</p>\n<p>In our individual data protection texts on the different tools you can find out how long the respective tracking tools save your data.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>Google Tag Manager itself does not set any cookies but manages different tracking websites\u2019 tags.\nIn our data protection texts on the different tracking tools you can find detailed information on how you can delete or manage your data.</p>\n<p>Google actively participates in the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, which regulates safe transfer of personal data.\nYou can find more information at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&amp;tid=121677243.\nIf you want to learn more about Google Tag Manager, we recommend you to read https://marketingplatform.google.com/intl/en_uk/about/tag-manager/.</p>\nNewsletter Privacy Policy\n<p>When you subscribe to our Newsletter you submit your personal data and give us the right to contact you via email.\nWe use the data that is stored for the registration for the Newsletter exclusively for our Newsletter and do not pass them on.</p>\n<p>If you unsubscribe from the newsletter \u2013 for which you can find a link in the bottom of every newsletter \u2013 we will delete all data that was saved when you registered for the newsletter.</p>\nMailChimp Privacy Policy\n<p>Like many other websites, we use the services of the newsletter company MailChimp on our website.\nThe operator of MailChimp is the company The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.\nWith the aid of MailChimp we can easily send you interesting news via newsletter.\nFor the use of the service we do not have to install anything but can still access a pool of very efficient features.\nIn the following we will give more details on this email marketing service and will inform you about the most important data protection aspects.</p>\nWhat is MailChimp?\n<p>MailChimp is a cloud-based newsletter management service.\n\u201cCloud-based\u201c means that we do not need to install MailChimp on our own computer or server.\nInstead, we use the service on an external server, or more specifically via an IT infrastructure, which is available via the internet.\nUsing a software this way is also called SaaS (software as a service).</p>\n<p>MailChimp allows us to chose from a wide range of different email types.\nDepending on what goal we want to reach with our newsletter, we can run individual campaigns, regular campaigns, auto responders (automated emails), A/B tests, RSS campaigns (mailings at pre-set times and frequencies) and follow-up campaigns.</p>\nWhy do we use MailChimp on our website?\n<p>The reason we would use any newsletter service is so we can stay in contact with you.\nWe want to keep you on the loop what news or attractive offers we have for you at the time.\nAs we constantly seek out the easiest and best solutions for our marketing measures, we have decided on MailChimp as our newsletter management service.\nWhile the software is very easy to use, it offers many helpful features.\nFor example, it allows us to create interesting and attractive newsletters in only a short time.\nWith integrated design templates we can create every newsletter in an individual way.\nDue to the \u201cresponsive design\u201d feature, our contents are also presented in a readable and pleasant way on your smartphone (or any other mobile device).</p>\n<p>With tools such as A/B testing or the extensive analysis options, we can swiftly tell how you like our newsletters.\nThis means that we can react if necessary and improve our offer or our services.</p>\n<p>Another advantage is MailChimp\u2019s \u201ccloud system\u201d.\nThe data is not stored and processed directly on our server.\nWe can retrieve the datafrom external servers and therefore save our memory space and also decrease maintenance effort.</p>\nWhat data is saved by MailChimp?\n<p>Rocket Science Group LLC (MailChimp) operate online platforms which enable us to get in contact with you, provided you subscribed to our newsletter.\nIf you become a subscriber of our newsletter via our website, by email you agree to become a member of a MailChimp email list.\nThen, MailChimp saves your subscription data and your IP address, so it can verify your entry into the list provider.\nMoreover, MailChimp stores your email address, your name, your physical address and demographic information, such as language or location.</p>\n<p>This information is used to send emails to you and to allow certain other MailChimp functions (e.g.\nthe evaluation of newsletters).</p>\n<p>MailChimp also shares information with third parties to improve its services.\nMoreover, MailChimp shares certain data with advertising partners of third parties to get a better understanding of its clients\u2019 interests, in order to provide relevant contents and target-oriented advertising.</p>\n<p>With so-called \u201cweb beacons\u201d (small graphics in HTML emails), MailChimp can determine if an email has arrived, has been opened or if links have been clicked.\nThis information is then stored on MailChimp\u2019s servers.\nThat way we receive statistical evaluations and can see how you liked our newsletter.\nTherefore, we can tailor our offer better to your wishes and improve our service.</p>\n<p>Moreover, MailChimp are allowed to use this data for improving their own service.\nThus, they can for example technically optimise the distribution or determine the location (or the country) of the recipient.</p>\n<p>The following cookies can be set by MailChimp.\nThe list is not exhaustive and is merely an exemplary selection:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name</strong>: AVESTA_ENVIRONMENT<br>\n<strong>Value: </strong>Prod<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> This cookie is necessary to provide the services of Mailchimp.\nIt is always set when a user registers for a newsletter mailing list.<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> at the end of the session</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name</strong>: ak_bmsc<br>\n<strong>Value:

Privacy Policy\n<p>We use Google AdSense on this website.\nIt is an advertising program of the company Google Inc.\n(1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).\nWith Google AdSense we can show advertisements that fit our theme.\nThus, we can offer you adverts that ideally give you added value.\nIn this privacy statement on Google AdSense we will explain to you, why we use Google AdSense on our website and which of your data is processed and saved, as well as how you can prevent this data retention.</p>\nWhat is Google AdSense?\n<p>The advertising program Google AdSense has been around since 2003.\nAs opposed to Google Ads (previously: Google AdWords) it is not possible to advertise on Google AdSense oneself.\nGoogle AdSense displays advertisements on websites, such as ours.\nThe biggest advantage of this web service compared to some others, is that Google AdSense only shows ads to you which match our website\u2019s contents.\nGoogle has its own algorithm which calculates what ads are shown to you.\nOf course, we only want to show you ads that interest you and provide you added value.\nGoogle checks which advertisements are suitable for our users, considering your interests, your user behaviour and our offer.\nAt this point we want to mention that we are not responsible for the choice of the ads.\nWe merely offer advertising space on our website, while Google selects the displayed ads.\nMoreover, since August 2013 the ads are customised to the respective user interface.\nThis means, that no matter if you visit our website with your smartphone, your PC or your laptop, the ads adjust to your terminal device.</p>\nWhy do we use Google AdSense on our website?\n<p>The operation of a high-quality website requires tremendous dedication and commitment.\nWe are essentially never finished with working on our website.\nThis is, because we continuously maintain and keep our website up to date.\nOf course, we want to achieve economic success with this work.\nTherefore, we decided for to use advertisements as a source of revenue.\nIt is most important to us however, that we do not disrupt your visit to our website with these advertisements.\nThence, with the aid of Google AdSense, only adverts that are tailored to you and our themes are shown.</p>\n<p>Like with Google\u2019s indexation for a website, a bot examines both, the matching content and the offers on our website.\nThen, the ads are adapted to and presented on the website.\nAlongside the contextual overlaps between the ads and website offer, AdSense also supports interest-based targeting.\nThis means, that Google also uses your data to offer advertising that is tailored to you.\nThat way you receive ads that ideally offer you added value, and it gives us a higher chance of earning a bit.</p>\nWhat data is stored by Google AdSense?\n<p>Google AdSense uses cookies to display ads that are customised to you.\nCookies are little text files, that store certain information on your computer.</p>\n<p>Cookies are supposed to enable improved advertisements in AdSense.\nThey do not contain any personally identifiable data.\nHowever, it should be considered that Google does not view data such as \u201cPseudonymous Cookie-IDs\u201d (name or other identification feature is replaced with a pseudonym) or IP addresses as personally identifiable information.\nAlthough, within the framework of the GDPR, this data can be classified as personal data.\nFollowing every impression (every time you see an ad), every click and any other activity that leads to a call on its servers, Google AdSense sends a cookie to the browser.\nThe cookie is then saved in the browser, provided the browser accepts it.</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances, third parties can place cookies in your browser, and read them or use web beacons, to store data they receive through the display of ads on the website.\nWeb beacons are little graphics that analyse and a record the log file.\nThis analysis allows a statistical evaluation for the online marketing.</p>\n<p>Through this cookie, Google can collect certain information on your user behaviour on our website.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information on how you interact with an ad (clicks, impressions, mouse movements)</li>\n<li>Information if an ad has already been displayed in your browser.\nThis data helps to prevent an ad from showing multiple times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thereby, Google evaluates and analyses data on the displayed advertising material along with your IP address.\nPrimarily, Google uses the data to measure the effectiveness of an ad and improve the advertising offer.\nMoreover, the data does not get linked to your personal data which Google might have received via other Google services.</p>\n<p>In the following we will introduce you to the cookies that Google AdSense uses for tracking purposes.\nPlease note, that we will refer to a test website, which only has Google AdSense installed to it:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> uid<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 891269189121677243-8<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> The cookie is stored under the

hour</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> This list does not claim to be exhaustive, as Google frequently change the choice of their cookies.</p>\nHow long and where is the data stored?\n<p>Google retains your IP address, as well as various activities you perform on the website.\nCookies store this information with the interactions on our website.\nAccording to Google, the company collects and saves the given information securely on its internal servers in the USA.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a Google account or are not logged in, Google usually stores the collected data on your browser with a unique identification (ID).\nThe IDs saved in cookies serve e.g.\nfor providing personalised advertisements.\nIf you are logged into a Google account, Google can gather personal information.</p>\n<p>You can delete certain data that is saved by Google anytime (see next section).\nMuch of the information saved in cookies get automatically deleted after a specific time.\nHowever, there are also data which are retained by Google for a longer period.\nThis is the case, when Google must store certain data for an undefined, longer period due to economical or legal necessities.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>You can always clear or deactivate cookies that are on your computer.\nHow exactly this can be done depends on the browser.</p>\n<p>Here you can find an instruction on how you can manage cookies in your browser:</p>\n<p> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </p>\n<p> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </p>\n<p> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </p>\n<p> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </p>\n<p> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </p>\n<p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies, you can set your browser to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set.\nThis lets you decide to either permit or deny the placement of every single cookie.\nBy downloading and installing the browser plugin at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996, any advertising cookies get deactivated as well.\nPlease note, that deactivating these cookies does not stop advertisements, it only inhibits personalised adverts.</p>\n<p>If you have a Google account, you can deactivate personalised adverts on the website https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.\nYou will continue to see ads, but they will stop being customised to your interests.\nNevertheless, the ads are displayed based on a few factors, such as your location, the browser type and the used search terms.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about what data Google generally collects and what they are used for at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.</p>\nGoogle Ads (Google AdWords) Conversion Tracking Privacy Policy\n<p>We use Google Ads (previously Google AdWords) as an online marketing measure, to advertise our products and services.\nThus, we want to draw more people\u2019s attention on the internet to the high quality of our offers.\nAs part of our advertising measures with Google Ads, we use the conversion tracking of Google LLC., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d) on our website.\nWith the aid of this free tracking tool we can tailor our advertising offer better to your interests and needs.\nIn the following article we will explain, why we use conversion tracking, what data gets saved and how you can prevent this data retention.</p>\nWhat is Google Ads conversion tracking?\n<p>Google Ads (previously Google AdWords) is the internal online advertising sxstem of the company Google LLC.\nWe are convinced of our offer\u2018s quality and would like as many people as possible to discover our website.\nFor this, Google Ads offers the best platform within the online environment.\nOf course, we also want to get an overview of the cost-benefit factor of our advertising campaigns.\nThence, we use Google Ads\u2019 conversion tracking tool.</p>\n<p>But what is a conversion actually? A conversion occurs, when you turn from an interested visitor into an acting website visitor.\nThis happens every time you click on our ad and then make another action, such as paying a visit to our website.\nWith Google\u2019s conversion tracking tool, we can understand what happens after a user clicks our Google ad.\nIt shows us for instance if products get bought, services are used or whether users have subscribed to our newsletter.</p>\nWhy do we use Google Ads conversion tracking on our website?\n<p>We use Google Ads to show our offer also across other websites.\nOur aim is for our advertising campaigns to reach only those people, who are interested in our offers.\nWith the conversion tracking tool, we see what keywords, ads, ad groups and campaigns lead to the desired customer actions.\nWe see how many customers interact with our ads on a device, to then convert.\nWith this data we can calculate our cost-benefit-factor, measure the success of individual ad campaigns and therefore optimise our online marketing measures.\nWith the help of the obtained data we can give our website a more interesting design and customise our advertising offer better to your needs.</p>\nWhat data is stored with Google Ads conversion tracking?\n<p>For a better analysis of certain user actions, we have integrated a conversion tracking tag, or code snippet to our website.\nTherefore, if you click one of our Google ads, a Google domain stores the cookie \u201cconversion\u201d on your computer (usually in the browser) or on your mobile device.\nCookies are little text files that save information on your computer.</p>\n<p>Here are data of the most significant cookies for Google\u2019s conversion tracking:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> Conversion<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> EhMI_aySuoyv4gIVled3Ch0llweVGAEgt-mr6aXd7dYlSAGQ121677243-3<br>\n<strong>Purpose: </strong>This cookie saves every conversion you make on our website after you came to us via a Google ad.<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after 3 months</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> _gac<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> 1.1558695989.EAIaIQobChMIiOmEgYO04gIVj5AYCh2CBAPrEAAYASAAEgIYQfD_BwE<br>\n<strong> Purpose:</strong> This is a classic Google Analytics Cookie that records various actions on our website.<br>\n<strong> Expiry date:</strong> after 3 months</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The cookie _gac only appears in connection with Google Analytics.\nThe above list does not claim to be exhaustive, as Google repeatedly change the cookies they use for analytical evaluation.</p>\n<p>As soon as you complete an action on our website, Google identifies the cookie and saves your action as a so-called conversion.\nFor as long as you surf our website, provided the cookie has not expired, both Google and us can determine that you found your way to us via a Google ad.\nThen, the cookie is read and sent back to Google Ads, together with the conversion data.\nMoreover, other cookies may also be used for measuring conversions.\nGoogle Ads\u2018 conversion tracking can be fine-tuned and improved with the aid of Google Analytics.\nFurthermore, ads which Google displays in various places across the web, might be placed under our domain with the name \u201c__gads\u201d or \u201c_gac\u201d.<br>\nSince September 2017, analytics.js retains various campaign information with the _gac cookie.\nThis cookie stores data, as soon as you open one of our sites that has been set up for Google Ads\u2019 auto-tagging.\nIn contrast to cookies that are placed for Google domains, Google can only read these conversion cookies when you are on our website.\nWe do neither collect nor receive any personal data.\nWe do obtain a report with statistical evaluations by Google.\nWith the help thereof, we can not only see the total number of users who clicked our ad, but also what advertising measures were well received.</p>\nHow long and where is the data stored?\n<p>At this point we want to reiterate, that we have no influence on how Google use the collected data.\nAccording to Google, the data are encrypted and saved on a secure server.\nIn most cases, conversion cookies expire after 30 days, and do not transmit any personalised data.\nThe cookies named \u201cconversion\u201c and \u201c_gac\u201c (which is used with Google Analytics) have an expiry date of 3 months.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>You have the possibility to opt out of Google Ads\u2019 conversion tracking.\nThe conversion tracking can be blocked by deactivating the conversion tracking cookie via your browser.\nIf you do this, you will not be considered for the statistic of the tracking tool.\nYou can change the cookie settings in your browser anytime.\nDoing so, works a little different in every browser.\nHence, in the following you will find an instruction on how to manage cookies in your browser:</p>\n<p> Chrome: Clear, enable and manage cookies in Chrome </p>\n<p> Safari: Manage cookies and website data in Safari </p>\n<p> Firefox: Clear cookies and site data in Firefox </p>\n<p> Internet Explorer: Delete and manage cookies </p>\n<p> Microsoft Edge: Delete cookies in Microsoft Edge </p>\n<p>If you generally do not want to allow any cookies at all, you can set up your browser to notify you whenever a potential cookie is about to be set.\nThis lets you decide upon permitting or denying the cookie\u2019s placement.\nBy downloading and installing the browser plugin at https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996 you can also deactivate all \u201cadvertising cookies\u201d.\nPlease consider that by deactivating these cookies, you cannot prevent all advertisements, only personalised ads.</p>\n<p>Due to the certification for the American-European data protection convention \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d, the American corporation Google LLC must comply to the EU\u2019s applicable data protection laws.\nIf you want to find out more on data protection at Google, we recommend Google\u2019s general Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.</p>\nGoogle reCAPTCHA Privacy Policy\n<p>Our primary goal is to provide you an experience on our website that is as secure and protected as possible.\nTo do this, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google Inc.\n(1600 Amphitheater Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043, USA).\nWith reCAPTCHA we can determine whether you are a real person from flesh and bones, and not a robot or a spam software.\nBy spam we mean any electronically undesirable information we receive involuntarily.\nClassic CAPTCHAS usually needed you to solve text or picture puzzles to check.\nBut thanks to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA you usually do have to do such puzzles.\nMost of the times it is enough to simply tick a box and confirm you are not a bot.\nWith the new Invisible reCAPTCHA version you don\u2019t even have to tick a box.\nIn this privacy policy you will find out how exactly this works, and what data is used for it.</p>\nWhat is reCAPTCHA?\n<p>reCAPTCHA is a free captcha service from Google that protects websites from spam software and misuse by non-human visitors.\nThis service is used the most when you fill out forms on the Internet.\nA captcha service is a type of automatic Turing-test that is designed to ensure specific actions on the Internet are done by human beings and not bots.\nDuring the classic Turing-test (named after computer scientist Alan Turing), a person differentiates between bot and human.\nWith Captchas, a computer or software program does the same.\nClassic captchas function with small tasks that are easy to solve for humans but provide considerable difficulties to machines.\nWith reCAPTCHA, you no longer must actively solve puzzles.\nThe tool uses modern risk techniques to distinguish people from bots.\nThe only thing you must do there, is to tick the text field \u201cI am not a robot\u201d.\nHowever, with Invisible reCAPTCHA even that is no longer necessary.\nreCAPTCHA, integrates a JavaScript element into the source text, after which the tool then runs in the background and analyses your user behaviour.\nThe software calculates a so-called captcha score from your user actions.\nGoogle uses this score to calculate the likelihood of you being a human, before entering the captcha.\nreCAPTCHA and Captchas in general are used every time bots could manipulate or misuse certain actions (such as registrations, surveys, etc.).</p>\nWhy do we use reCAPTCHA on our website?\n<p>We only want to welcome people from flesh and bones on our side and want bots or spam software of all kinds to stay away.\nTherefore, we are doing everything we can to stay protected and to offer you the highest possible user friendliness.\nFor this reason, we use Google reCAPTCHA from Google.\nThus, we can be pretty sure that we will remain a \u201cbot-free\u201d website.\nUsing reCAPTCHA, data is transmitted to Google to determine whether you genuinely are human.\nreCAPTCHA thus ensures our website\u2019s and subsequently your security.\nWithout reCAPTCHA it could e.g.\nhappen that a bot would register as many email addresses as possible when registering, in order to subsequently \u201cspam\u201d forums or blogs with unwanted advertising content.\nWith reCAPTCHA we can avoid such bot attacks.</p>\nWhat data is stored by reCAPTCHA?\n<p>reCAPTCHA collects personal user data to determine whether the actions on our website are made by people.\nThus, IP addresses and other data Google needs for its reCAPTCHA service, may be sent to Google.\nWithin member states of the European Economic Area, IP addresses are almost always compressed before the data makes its way to a server in the USA.<br>\nMoreover, your IP address will not be combined with any other of Google\u2019s data, unless you are logged into your Google account while using reCAPTCHA.\nFirstly, the reCAPTCHA algorithm checks whether Google cookies from other Google services (YouTube, Gmail, etc.) have already been placed in your browser.\nThen reCAPTCHA sets an additional cookie in your browser and takes a snapshot of your browser window.</p>\n<p>The following list of collected browser and user data is not exhaustive.\nRather, it provides examples of data, which to our knowledge, is processed by Google.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Referrer URL (the address of the page the visitor has come from)</li>\n<li>IP-address (z.B.\n256.123.123.1)</li>\n<li>Information on the operating system (the software that enables the operation of your computers.\nPopular operating systems are Windows, Mac OS X or Linux)</li>\n<li>Cookies (small text files that save data in your browser)</li>\n<li>Mouse and keyboard behaviour (every action you take with your mouse or keyboard is stored)</li>\n<li>Date and language settings (the language and date you have set on your PC is saved)</li>\n<li>All Javascript objects (JavaScript is a programming language that allows websites to adapt to the user.\nJavaScript objects can collect all kinds of data under one name)</li>\n<li>Screen resolution (shows how many pixels the image display consists of)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Google may use and analyse this data even before you click on the \u201cI am not a robot\u201d checkmark.\nIn the Invisible reCAPTCHA version, there is no need to even tick at all, as the entire recognition process runs in the background.\nMoreover, Google have not given details on what information and how much data they retain.</p>\n<p>The following cookies are used by reCAPTCHA: With the following list we are referring to Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA demo version at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo.<br>\nFor tracking purposes, all these cookies require a unique identifier.\nHere is a list of cookies that Google reCAPTCHA has

long and where are the data stored?\n<p>Due to the integration of reCAPTCHA, your data will be transferred to the Google server.\nGoogle have not disclosed where exactly this data is stored, despite repeated inquiries.\nBut even without confirmation from Google, it can be assumed that data such as mouse interaction, length of stay on a website or language settings are stored on the European or American Google servers.\nThe IP address that your browser transmits to Google does generally not get merged with other Google data from the company\u2019s other services.<br>\nHowever, the data will be merged if you are logged in to your Google account while using the reCAPTCHA plug-in.\n<strong>Google\u2019s diverging privacy policy applies for this.</strong>\n</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data storage?\n<p>If you want to prevent any data about you and your behaviour to be transmitted to Google, you must fully log out of Google and delete all Google cookies before visiting our website or use the reCAPTCHA software.\nGenerally, the data is automatically sent to Google as soon as you visit our website.\nTo delete this data, you must contact Google Support at

out more about reCAPTCHA on Google\u2019s Developers page at https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/.\nWhile Google do give more detail on the technical development of reCAPTCHA there, they have not disclosed precise information about data retention and data protection.\nA good, basic overview of the use of data however, can be found in the company\u2019s internal privacy policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB.</p>\nCloudflare Privacy Policy\n<p>We use Cloudflare by the company Cloudflare, Inc.\n(101 Townsend St., San Francisco, CA 94107, USA) on this website to enhance its speed and security.\nFor this, Cloudflare uses cookies and processes user data.\nCloudflare, Inc.\nis an American company that offers a content delivery network and various security services.\nThese services take place between the user and our hosting provider.\nIn the following, we will try to explain in detail what all this means.</p>\nWhat is Cloudflare?\n<p>A content delivery network (CDN), as provided by Cloudflare, is nothing more than a network of servers that are connected to each other.\nCloudflare has deployed servers around the world, which ensure websites can appear on your screen faster.\nSimply put, Cloudflare makes copies of our website and places them on its own servers.\nThus, when you visit our website, a load distribution system ensures that the main part of our website is delivered by a server that can display our website to you as quickly as possible.\nThe CDN significantly shortens the route of the transmitted data to your browser.\nThus, Cloudflare does not only deliver our website\u2019s content from our hosting server, but from servers from all over the world.\nCloudflare is particularly helpful for users from abroad, since pages can be delivered from a nearby server.\nIn addition to the fast delivery of websites, Cloudflare also offers various security services, such as DDoS protection, or the web application firewall.</p>\nWhy do we use Cloudflare on our website?\n<p>Of course, we want our website to offer you the best possible service.\nCloudflare helps us make our website faster and more secure.\nCloudflare offers us web optimisations as well as security services such as DDoS protection and a web firewall.\nMoreover, this includes a Reverse-Proxy and the content distribution network (CDN).\nCloudflare blocks threats and limits abusive bots as well as crawlers that waste our bandwidth and server resources.\nBy storing our website in local data centres and blocking spam software, Cloudflare enables us to reduce our bandwidth usage by about 60%.\nFurthermore, the provision of content through a data centre near you and certain web optimizations carried out there, cut the average loading time of a website in about half.\nAccording to Cloudflare, the setting \u201cI\u2019m Under Attack Mode\u201d can be used to mitigate further attacks by displaying a JavaScript calculation task that must be solved before a user can access a website.\nOverall, this makes our website significantly more powerful and less susceptible to spam or other attacks.</p>\nWhat data is stored by Cloudflare?\n<p>Cloudflare generally only transmits data that is controlled by website operators.\nTherefore, Cloudflare does not determine the content, but the website operator themselves does.\nAdditionally, Cloudflare may collect certain information about the use of our website and may process data we send or data which Cloudflare has received certain instructions for.\nMostly, Cloudflare receives data such as IP addresses, contacts and protocol information, security fingerprints and websites\u2019 performance data.\nLog data for example helps Cloudflare identify new threats.\nThat way, Cloudflare can ensure a high level of security for our website.\nAs part of their services, Cloudflare process this data in compliance with the applicable laws.\nOf course, this also includes the compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Cloudflare uses a cookie for security reasons.\nThe cookie (__cfduid) is used to identify individual users behind a shared IP address, and to apply security settings for each individual user.\nThe cookie is very useful, if you e.g.\nuse our website from a restaurant where several infected computers are located.\nHowever, if your computer is trustworthy, we can recognise that with the cookie.\nHence, you will be able to freely and carelessly surf our website, despite the infected PCs in your area.\nAnother point that is important to know, is that this cookie does not store any personal data.\nThe cookie is essential for Cloudflare\u2019s security functions and cannot be deactivated.</p>\nCookies from Cloudflare\n<p>\n<strong>Name:</strong> __cfduid<br>\n<strong>Value:</strong> d798bf7df9c1ad5b7583eda5cc5e78121677243-3<br>\n<strong>Purpose:</strong> Security settings for each individual visitor<br>\n<strong>Expiry date:</strong> after one year</p>\n<p>Cloudflare also works with third parties.\nThey may however only process personal data after the instruction of Cloudflare and in accordance with the data protection guidelines and other confidentiality and security measures.\nWithout explicit consent from us, Cloudflare will not pass on any personal data.</p>\nHow long and where is the data stored?\n<p>Cloudflare stores your information primarily in the United States and the European Economic Area.\nCloudflare can transfer and access the information described above, from all over the world.\nIn general, Cloudflare stores domains\u2019 user-level data with the Free, Pro and Business versions for less than 24 hours.\nFor enterprise domains that have activated Cloudflare Logs (previously called Enterprise LogShare or ELS), data can be stored for up to 7 days.\nHowever, if IP addresses trigger security warnings in Cloudflare, there may be exceptions to the storage period mentioned above.</p>\nHow can I delete my data or prevent data retention?\n<p>Cloudflare only keeps data logs for as long as necessary and in most cases deletes the data within 24 hours.\nCloudflare also does not store any personal data, such as your IP address.\nHowever, there is information that Cloudflare store indefinitely as part of their permanent logs.\nThis is done to improve the overall performance of Cloudflare Resolver and to identify potential security risks.\nYou can find out exactly which permanent logs are saved at https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/commitment-to-privacy/privacy-policy/privacy-policy/.\nAll data Cloudflare collects (temporarily or permanently) is cleared of all personal data.\nCloudflare also anonymise all permanent logs.</p>\n<p>In their privacy policy, Cloudflare state that they are not responsible for the content you receive.\nFor example, if you ask Cloudflare whether you can update or delete content, Cloudflare will always refer to us as the website operator.\nYou can also completely prevent the collection and processing of your data by Cloudflare, when you deactivate the execution of script-code in your browser, or if you integrate a script blocker to your browser.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare is an active participant in the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data.\nYou can find more information on this at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000GnZKAA0.<br>\nYou can learn more on Cloudflare\u2019s data protection at https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/.</p>\njQuery CDN Privacy Policy\n<p>We use jQuery CDN services by the jQuery Foundation to deliver our website and our subpages to you quickly and easily on different devices.\njQuery is distributed via the Content Delivery Network (CDN) of the American software company StackPath (LCC 2012 McKinney Ave.\nSuite 1100, Dallas, TX 75201, USA).\nThis service stores, manages and processes your personal data.</p>\n<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected to each other via the Internet.\nThrough this network content and especially very large files, can be delivered quickly \u2013 even in peak demand periods.</p>\n<p>jQuery uses JavaScript libraries to be able to deliver our website content quickly.\nFor this, a CDN server loads the necessary files.\nAs soon as a connection to the CDN server is established, your IP address is recorded and stored.\nThis only happens if the data has not already been saved in your browser during a previous website visit.</p>\n<p>StackPath\u2019s privacy policy explicitly mentions that StackPath uses aggregated and anonymised data of various services (such as jQuery) for both, security enhancement and its own services.\nHowever, it is impossible for you to be personally identified with the use of this data.</p>\n<p>If you want to avoid this data transfer, you always have the option to use JavaScript blockers such as ghostery.com or noscript.net.\nYou can also simply deactivate the execution of JavaScript codes in your browser.\nIf you decide to deactivate JavaScript codes, the usual functions will also change.\nFor example, websites may no longer load as quickly.</p>\n<p>StackPath is an active participant in the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, which regulates the correct and secure transfer of personal data.\nYou can find more information at https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000CbahAAC&amp;status=Active.<br>\nAlso, you can find more information about StackPath\u2019s data protection at https://www.stackpath.com/legal/privacy-statement/ and jQuery\u2019s data protection at https://openjsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/84/2019/11/OpenJS-Foundation-Privacy-Policy-2019-11-15.pdf.</p>\njsdelivr.com-CDN Privacy Policy\n<p>In order for us to be able to deliver our individual websites to you quickly and correctly on different devices, we use the open source services of jsdelivr.com by the Polish software company ProspectOne, Kr\u00f3lewska 65A/1, 30-081, Krak\u00f3w, Poland.</p>\n<p>jsDelivr is a Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nThis is a network of regionally distributed servers that are connected via the Internet.\nAs a result, content, especially large files, can be delivered quickly and optimally, even with large peak loads.</p>\n<p>jsDelivr is designed to enable the download of JavaScript libraries that are hosted on npm and Github servers.\nWordPress plugins can also be loaded, provided they are hosted on WordPress.org.\nTo be able to provide this service, your browser may send personal data to jsdelivr.com.\ncan Therefore, jsDelivr can collect and save user data such as IP address, browser type, browser version, information on which website is loaded or the time and date of the page visit.\nThe jsdelivr.com privacy policy expressly states that the company does not use cookies or other tracking services.</p>\n<p>If you want to prevent this data transmission, you can install a JavaScript blocker (for example at https://noscript.net/).\nHowever, please note that this means that the website then can no longer offer its usual services (such as fast loading speeds).</p>\n<p>Further information on data processing by the software service jsDelivr can be found in the company\u2019s privacy policy at https://www.jsdelivr.com/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net.</p>\nAll texts are copyrighted.<p>Source: Created with the
