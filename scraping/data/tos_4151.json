movements.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nPseudonymisation\n<p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to

subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the

computer system via an Internet browser.</p>\n<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies.\nMany cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.\nA cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\nIt consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.\nThis allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.\nA specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>\n<p>Through the use of cookies, the MyLiveSignature.com can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>\n<p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.\nCookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.\nThe purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.\nThe website user that uses cookies, e.g.\ndoes not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.\nAnother example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.\nThe online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>\n<p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nFurthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.\nThis is possible in all popular Internet browsers.\nIf the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.</p> 5.\nCollection of general data and information\n<p>The website of the MyLiveSignature.com collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.\nThis general data and information are stored in the server log files.\nCollected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.</p>\n<p>When using these general data and information, the MyLiveSignature.com does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, the MyLiveSignature.com analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p> 6.\nRegistration on our website\n<p>The data subject has the possibility to register on the website of the controller with the indication of personal data.\nWhich personal data are transmitted to the controller is determined by the respective input mask used for the registration.\nThe personal data entered by the data subject are collected and stored exclusively for internal use by the controller, and for his own purposes.\nThe controller may request transfer to one or more processors (e.g.\na parcel service, payment services etc) that also uses personal data for an internal purpose which is attributable to the controller.</p>\n<p>By registering on the website of the controller, the IP address\u2014assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) and used by the data subject\u2014date, and time of the registration are also stored.\nThe storage of this data takes place against the background that this is the only way to prevent the misuse of our services, and, if necessary, to make it possible to investigate committed offenses.\nInsofar, the storage of this data is necessary to secure the controller.\nThis data is not passed on to third parties unless there is a statutory obligation to pass on the data, or if the transfer serves the aim of criminal prosecution.\n</p>\n<p>The registration of the data subject, with the voluntary indication of personal data, is intended to enable the controller to offer the data subject contents or services that may only be offered to registered users due to the nature of the matter in question.\nRegistered persons are free to change the personal data specified during the registration at any time, or to have them completely deleted from the data stock of the controller.</p>\n<p>The data controller shall, at any time, provide information upon request to each data subject as to what personal data are stored about the data subject.\nIn addition, the data controller shall correct or erase personal data at the request or indication of the data subject, insofar as there are no statutory storage obligations.\nThe entirety of the controller\u2019s employees are available to the data subject in this respect as contact persons.</p> 7.\nContact possibility via the website <p>The website of the MyLiveSignature.com contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the so-called

third parties.</p> 8.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data\n<p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>\n<p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p> 9.\nRights of the data subject\n<ul>\n<li>a) Right of confirmation\n<p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the

Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>\n<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component.\nAn overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>\n<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject\u2014and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site\u2014which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.\nThis information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject.\nIf the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g.\nthe \"Like\" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>\n<p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website.\nThis occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not.\nIf such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>\n<p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook.\nIn addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject.\nIn addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook.\nThese applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p> 11.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google AdSense\n<p>On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdSense.\nGoogle AdSense is

purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Alphabet Inc.\ngains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission settlements.\n</p>\n<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc.\nfrom setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nAdditionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc.\nmay be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels.\nA tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis through which a statistical analysis may be performed.\nBased on the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc.\nis able to determine if and when a website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by the data subject.\nTracking pixels serve, inter alia, to analyze the flow of visitors on a website.</p>\n<p>Through Google AdSense, personal data and information\u2014which also includes the IP address, and is necessary for the collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements\u2014is transmitted to Alphabet Inc.\nin the United States of America.\nThese personal data will be stored and processed in the United States of America.\nThe Alphabet Inc.\nmay

has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).\nGoogle Analytics is a web analytics service.\nWeb analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.\nA web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.\nWeb analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>\n<p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>\n<p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application \"_gat.\n_anonymizeIp\".\nBy means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.\nGoogle uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nWith the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>\n<p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.\nWith each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.\nThese personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\n</p>\n<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nIn addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>\n<p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.\nFor this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it.\nThis browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.\nThe installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.\nIf the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics.\nIf the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>\n<p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under

https://www.primis.tech/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Primis-Privacy-Policy-GDPR.pdf</p> 21.\nLegal basis for the processing <p>Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIs our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\nSuch processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nHe considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n</p> 22.\nThe legitimate interests pursued by

data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data <p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n</p> 25.\nExistence of automated decision-making\n<p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or
