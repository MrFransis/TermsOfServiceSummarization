and by any agents and contractors for the purposes of performing the Services, and Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain explicit consent from relevant Data Subjects in respect of such potential transfers) without the prior written consent of Customer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and if such consent has been obtained (or is unnecessary), such Restricted Transfer may only be made where there are Appropriate Safeguards in place with regard to the rights of Data Subjects (including but not limited to the Standard Contractual Clauses, binding corporate rules, or any other model clauses or transfer mechanism approved by the applicable supervisory authority).</li>\n<li>Subject to Clause 10.5, in the event of any Restricted Transfer by BrowserStack to a contracted Sub-processor, to any Affiliate of Customer or otherwise (\u201cData Importer\u201d) for which Customer\u2019s consent has been obtained (or is unnecessary), BrowserStack and Customer shall ensure that (i) Customer (where the RestrictedTransfer is being made at the request of Customer) or BrowserStack acting as agent for and on behalf of Customer (where the Restricted Transfer is being made at the request of BrowserStack), and (ii) the DataImporter, shall enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of such Restricted Transfer.\nThe Party who is entering into the Standard Contractual Clauses with a Data Importer shall comply with the guidance of any relevant regulatory authority on Restricted Transfers in particular with respect to the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and any additional measures required to be taken in the context of any such Restricted Transfers.</li>\n<li>Subject to Clause 10.5, any Restricted Transfer made by one Party (\u201cData Exporter\u201d) to the other Party (\u201cData Importer\u201d) shall be made subject to the provisions set out in the Standard Contractual Clauses contained here, and such Standard Contractual Clauses (except for any optional provisions contained in same, which shall not apply) are hereby specifically incorporated into this Agreement by reference for such purpose.</li>\n<li>Subject to Clause 10.5, in the event that a transfer of Personal Data from the EEA to the United Kingdom is considered a Restricted Transfer, because the United Kingdom has left the European Union, Parties shall procure that the Data Importer shall enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of such Restricted Transfer.</li>\n<li>Clauses 10.1 or 10.2 shall not apply to a Restricted Transfer if other compliance steps (which may include, but shall not be limited to, obtaining explicit consents from Data Subjects) have been taken to allow the relevant Restricted Transfer to take place without breach of applicable Data Protection Legislation.</li>\n<li>In the event that there is any conflict between the Standard Contractual clauses and the other provisions of this Agreement, such Standard Contractual Clauses shall take precedence in respect of such conflict (other than in respect of legislative references etc.\nwhich have been updated pursuant to Data Protection Legislation since the date of approval of such Standard Contractual Clauses.)</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sub-processors</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Customer agrees and acknowledges that BrowserStack may have Account-Related Information and Customer Content Processed by any of BrowserStack Affiliates and by any agents and contractors for the purpose of providing the Service (a \u201cSub-processor\u201d).\nA current list of the categories of Sub-processors used by BrowserStack is maintained on BrowserStack\u2019s website at https://www.browserstack.com/sub-processors.\nCustomer specifically authorizes the engagement as Sub-processors of (a) those entities listed at the URL mentioned herein, and (b) all other BrowserStack Affiliates from time to time.\nCustomer generally authorizes the engagement as Sub-processors of any other third parties.\nIn case BrowserStack intends to add a new Sub-processor, BrowserStack shall update the website ten (10) days prior to authorizing any new Sub-processor to Process Account-Related Information and Customer Content in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.</li>\n<li>Customer may reasonably object to BrowserStack\u2019s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying BrowserStack promptly in writing within the ten (10) days after BrowserStack updates its website in accordance with the mechanism set out in Clause 11.1.\nIn the event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentence, BrowserStack will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services.\nIf BrowserStack is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) by providing written notice to BrowserStack.</li>\n<li>With respect to each Sub-processor, BrowserStack shall, before the Sub-processor first Processes Account-Related Information), ensure that the Sub-processor is capable of providing the level of protection for Account-Related Information required by this Exhibit.</li>\n<li>BrowserStack will remain fully liable to Customer in respect of any failure by the Sub-processor to fulfil its data protection obligations regarding Account-Related Information.</li>\n<li>If Customer has entered into the Standard Contract Clauses, the authorizations given by the Customer under this Section 11 shall constitute Customer\u2019s prior written consent to the subcontracting by BrowserStack of the processing of personal data.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audit Rights</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>BrowserStack Audits:</strong> BrowserStack uses external auditors to verify the adequacy of

professionals at BrowserStack\u2019s selection and expense.\nand (d) will result in the generation of System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Report (\u201cReport\u201d), which will be BrowserStack\u2019s Confidential Information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Audit Reports:</strong> At Customer\u2019s written request, and provided that the parties have an applicable NDA in place, BrowserStack will provide Customer with a copy of the Report and other documents and information via questionnaires, so that Customer can reasonably verify BrowserStack\u2019s compliance with its obligations under this DPA.</li>\n<li>Customer agrees to exercise any right it may have to conduct an audit or inspection, under the Standard Contractual Clauses if they apply, by instructing BrowserStack to carry out the audit described in Section 12.1.\nIf Customer wishes to change this instruction regarding the audit, then Customer has the right to request a change to this instruction by sending BrowserStack a written notice as provided for in the Agreement.\nIf a written notice is sent by the Customer, including under the Standard Contract Clauses if they apply, BrowserStack will allow Customer or an independent auditor appointed by Customer to conduct audits once every five (5) years, if required by law and in accordance with this Section:<ol>\n<li>Customer must send a written request for audits to BrowserStack.</li>\n<li>Following receipt by BrowserStack of such request, BrowserStack and Customer shall discuss and agree in advance on: (i) the reasonable date(s) of and security and confidentiality controls applicable to any review of the SOC 2 report.\nand (ii) the reasonable start date, scope and duration of and security and confidentiality controls applicable to any audit.</li>\n<li>Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all costs / expenses pertaining to such an audit.</li>\n<li>BrowserStack may object in writing to an auditor appointed by the Customer to conduct any audit if the auditor is, in BrowserStack\u2019s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of BrowserStack, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable.\nAny such objection by the BrowserStack will require the Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If BrowserStack declines to follow any instruction requested by Customer regarding audits or inspections, Customer is entitled to terminate this DPA and the Agreement.\nIf the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, except for providing clarification on their implementation, nothing in this Section varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses nor affects any supervisory authority\u2019s or data subject\u2019s rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Warranties</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>BrowserStack warrant and undertake to Customer that:<ol>\n<li>BrowserStack will Process Account-Related

BrowserStack or its Sub-processors Processing Personal Information.\nand</li>\n<li>notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, Customer shall reimburse BrowserStack for costs incurred or likely to be incurred, at BrowserStack\u2019s option in advance under this Section (where matters are to be at Customer\u2019s cost).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consequences of termination on Customer Content</strong>\n<p>Upon termination or expiry of this Agreement, at the choice of Customer, BrowserStack shall delete or return all Customer Content to Customer and delete
