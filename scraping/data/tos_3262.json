other aspect of our relationship.\n</p>Binding Individual Arbitration<p> You and Privacy agree to arbitrate any and all Disputes by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.\nANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.\nYOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST PRIVACY.\nIf any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).\nAll Disputes will be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association according to this Section and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum.\nConsumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims court and proceeds only on an individual (non-class or non-representative) basis.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16, fully applies.\nIf you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county where you reside.\nOtherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York County, New York, or another mutually agreeable location.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nWe will pay the arbitration fees due to the American Arbitration Association for individual arbitrations brought in accordance with this section.\nIf you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney\u2019s fees, you may seek to recover those fees from the arbitrator.\nFor any claim where you are seeking relief, we will not seek to have you pay our attorney\u2019s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.\nFor purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Privacy also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Services.\nSubject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in state court in New York County, New York, or federal court for the Southern District of New York.\n</p>Governing Law<p> These General Terms and any Dispute will be governed by New York law and/or applicable federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act) as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within New York, without regard to its choice of law or conflicts of law principles.\n</p>Limitation on Time to Initiate a Dispute<p> Any action or proceeding by you relating to any Dispute must commence within 90 days after the cause of action accrues.\n</p>Assignment<p> These General Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you and any attempted transfer or assignment will be null and void.\n</p>Third Party Services and Links to Other Web Sites<p> You may be offered services, products and promotions provided by third parties and not by Privacy (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d).\nIf you decide to use Third Party Services you will be responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions for these services.\nWe are not responsible for the performance of any Third Party Services.\nThe Services may contain links to third party websites.\nThe inclusion of any website link does not imply an approval, endorsement, or recommendation by Privacy.\nSuch third party websites are not governed by these General Terms.\nYou access any such website at your own risk.\nWe expressly disclaim any liability for these websites.\nWhen you use a link to go from the Services to a third party website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.\nYour browsing and interaction on a third party website, including those that have a link in the Services is subject to that website\u2019s own terms, rules and policies.\n</p>Force Majeure<p> Privacy shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargos, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.\n</p>Notice<p> You are responsible for providing Privacy with your most current email address.\nIn the event that the last email address you provided to Privacy is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering you notices required/permitted under these Terms, Privacy\u2019s dispatch of the email containing such notice will constitute effective notice.\nYou may give notice to Privacy at the following address: (148 Lafayette St, Fl 3, NY, NY 10013) Such notice shall be deemed to be given when received by Privacy by letter delivered by nationally recognized overnight service or first class postage prepaid mail at the above address.\n</p>Other Provisions<p> These General Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms or Policies, are a complete statement of the agreement between you and Privacy regarding the Services.\nIn the event of a conflict between these General Terms and any other Privacy agreement or Policy, these General Terms will prevail and control the subject matter of such conflict.\nIf any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Term is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\nThese General Terms do not limit any rights that we may have under trade secret, copyright, patent, or other laws.\nNo waiver of any term of these General Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.\n</p>Privacy Payment Terms<p> By using Pay With Privacy,

appropriate and use third party services to help us verify your identity and determine if we should open, maintain, collect or close your account.\nWe may also report the status, history and/or closure of your account to third-party services.\n</p>\n<p> If you allow someone else to use your Privacy Account, you are responsible and liable for all transactions, withdrawals, deposits and fees that arise out of such use.\n</p>Requests for Additional Information and Inspection<p> Privacy may request additional information from you at any time.\nFor example, Privacy may ask you to present a government issued identification such as a passport or driver\u2019s license, a business license, or other information.\nIf you refuse any of these requests, your Privacy Account may be suspended or terminated.\n</p>Adding a Funding Source<p> Payments made by Privacy on your behalf are settled to an authorized funding source.\nIn order to use Privacy\u2019s Payment Services, you must first add an eligible funding source to your Privacy Account via the Privacy website or mobile app.\nBy connecting a funding source, you are pre-authorized recurring transfers by Privacy from that funding source.\n</p>\n<p>If you add a funding source to your Privacy Account, you agree that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are the owner of the funding source;</li>\n<li> You are authorized to transfer funds from that funding source.\nand </li>\n<li> You authorize us to initiate debits from your funding source according to your instructions.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Any authorizations to debit a funding source will remain in full force and effect until you cancel the authorization by removing the funding source.\nYou can remove a funding source on the Privacy website.\nIf you cancel your authorization, you will give us enough time to act on your cancellation.\nBy entering your funding source information on the Privacy site, you have signed this ACH authorization and you should print and save a copy of it.\n</p>Payment<p> Each time a payment is made by Privacy on your behalf, the amount of the transaction will be settled from your designated funding source.\nIf Privacy is not able to settle a transaction with your account, your Privacy Account may be suspended.\n</p>Availability of Payment Services<p> We may restrict your access to Payment Services if we need to conduct an investigation or resolve any pending dispute related to your use of the Payment Services.\nWe may also restrict access to Payment Services as necessary to comply with applicable law or court order, or if requested by any governmental entity.\n</p>Privacy Account History<p> When a payment is made on your behalf we will update your Privacy Account activity on the website and provide you a transaction confirmation.\nThe confirmation will serve as your receipt.\nSummaries of your Privacy Account activity, including monthly statements, are available on our website for up to one year of account activity.\nExcept as required by law, you are solely responsible for (a) compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your Privacy Account and your use of the Payment Services, and (b) reconciling all transactional information that is associated with your Privacy Account.\nIf you believe that there is an error or unauthorized transaction activity is associated with your Privacy Account, you must contact us immediately.\n</p>Processing Errors<p> We will attempt to fix processing errors we discover.\nIf the error resulted in your payment of an amount larger than what you authorize we will transfer the difference to your linked bank account.\nIf the error resulted in your payment of an amount less than what you authorized Privacy will debit the extra funds from your linked bank account.\nWe will only correct transactions that are processed incorrectly if you notify us with (1) your name and Privacy Account information, (2) A description of the error or transaction and why you believe it is an error or why you need more information and (3) the dollar amount of the suspected error.\nPlease notify us of such an error by calling 844-771-8229 or writing to us at (Pay with Privacy, Inc., 148 Lafayette St, Fl 3, NY, NY 10013) as soon as possible.\nYour failure to notify us of a processing error within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.\n</p>Payment Dispute Resolution Procedure<p> You agree to comply with our Payment Dispute Procedure for any payments in relation to any Payment Services provided by Privacy.\nIf you\u2019re unable to resolve a transaction related issue directly with a merchant, please notify us via your Privacy dashboard.\nThis is our process for resolving disputes.\n</p>\n<p> 1: Open a dispute case within ninety (90) days of the date of the transaction in question via your Privacy dashboard by clicking on the transaction and the dispute button in the top right corner of modal that pops up.\nDepending on your claim (item not received or refund not received), we may ask you to wait 10 business days from the transaction date to proceed with the payment dispute.\n</p>\n<p> 2: Respond to our requests for other information.\nPrivacy may require you to provide receipts, third party evaluations, police reports or other documents depending on the situation.\nYou must respond to these requests in a timely manner as requested in our correspondence with you.\n</p>\n<p> 3: Comply with Privacy\u2019s shipping requests in a timely manner, if you\u2019re filing a Significantly Not as Described claim, we may require you, at your expense, to ship the item back to the seller, to us, or to a third party (specified by Privacy) and to provide signature confirmation proof of delivery.\n</p>\n<p> 4: Privacy will make a final decision on your claim, in its sole discretion, based on the coverage and eligibility requirements set forth above, any additional information provided during the online payment dispute resolution process or any other information Privacy deems relevant and appropriate under the circumstances.\n</p>Excessive Payment Disputes<p> If we believe you might incur, or you are incurring, an excessive number of Payment Disputes, we may establish additional conditions governing your Privacy Account, including terminating or suspending the Payment Services.\n</p>Restricted Use<p> You will not act as a payment facilitator or otherwise resell the Payment Services to any third party.\nYou will not use the Payment Services to handle, process or transmit funds for any third party.\n</p>Unauthorized or Illegal Use<p> You will only use your Privacy Account for transactions that are allowed by law.\nWe may decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us if we believe that the transaction is in violation of these terms or any other agreement with Privacy, or that it exposes you, our customers, our processors, merchants or Privacy to harm.\nHarm includes fraud and other criminal acts.\nIf we suspect that your Privacy Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Privacy Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement and, as deemed necessary by Privacy, our payment processing and financial institution partners.\n</p>PCI Compliance<p> Privacy complies with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), as well as any requirements under the Network Rules.\nYou will cooperate in forensic investigations as required by Privacy or its partners.\n</p>Additional Indemnity<p> In addition to the General Terms, you will indemnify, defend, and hold us and our processors (and our respective employees, directors, agents, affiliates and representatives) harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, losses, damages, judgments, Tax assessments, penalties, interest, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) arising out of any claim, action, audit, investigation, inquiry, or other proceeding instituted by a person or entity that arises out of or relates to any transaction submitted by you through the Payment Service.\n</p>Set Off<p> You acknowledge that, except as otherwise prohibited by law, Privacy will have the right to charge or set off against your account any indebtedness or other obligations which you or any owner owe us, at any time, without any further notice to or demand on you, whether the indebtedness or other obligations exist at the time the account is opened or arise later.\nThe indebtedness includes, without limitation, all charges incurred on any account you hold with Privacy.\nYou agree that Privacy may set off against the account any claim which we have against you without regard to the source or ownership of the funds on deposit in the account and without requirement that the claim be owed to us by all of the account owners.\nYou also agree that, to the extent allowed by law, Privacy may set off any indebtedness or other obligations which you owe us under this Agreement against any other account or property in which you have an ownership interest that is in Privacy\u2019s possession or control.\n</p>Privacy Cashback Promotions<p> Participants in Privacy cashback promotions may earn Privacy Credits (as defined below) on up to $4,500 of monthly net purchases using their Privacy Account (initiated transaction amounts on purchases minus any credits or returns).\nPrivacy Credits resulting from Privacy purchases during a calendar month will be automatically applied to your Privacy account generally within the first ten (10) business days of the next calendar month.\nHowever, the timing of when Privacy Credits are applied may vary based on specific terms of a promotion.\n</p>\n<p> If you close your Privacy Account, all purchases made during the calendar month that the Account was closed will not be eligible for the Privacy cashback promotion.\nWe reserve the right to render your account ineligible for the cashback promotion in the event of any Chargebacks, ACH bounces, ACH disputes, or suspicious activity associated with your Account.\n</p>\n<p> Determination of promotion eligibility, duration of a promotion, and the maximum amount of credit earned are at the sole discretion of Privacy.\nPrivacy reserves the right to modify the rate or timing of Privacy Credits earned by any user pursuant to the promotion at any time.\nPrivacy reserves the right to verify and adjust credits at any time prior to or following credit.\nYour Privacy account must be active and in good standing, as determined by Privacy at its sole discretion, to receive Privacy Credits.\n</p>\n<p> In our sole discretion, we may deduct Privacy Credits from your account or make a debit entry to your connected funding source in order to make adjustments for returns, purchase cancellations or fraudulent activity.\nAny such adjustments, however, will be made in accordance with this Agreement, any applicable Privacy policies and terms, and any and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nIt is your responsibility to check your Account regularly to ensure that Privacy Credit has been properly credited and paid and that your Account balance is accurate.\nIf you believe that Privacy Credit has not been correctly credited to your account, you must contact Privacy Support within ninety (90) days of the transaction.\nShould you disagree with any adjustments made to your account or payments made to you, your sole remedy is to withdraw from the Program.\n</p>Privacy Credits<p> Your account may contain Privacy Credits.\nPrivacy Credits can be used for payment of an eligible purchase made with your Privacy account.\nUnless expressly stated otherwise, unused Privacy Credits may expire after twelve months of account inactivity.\nPrivacy Credits are not redeemable for cash, cannot be transferred, gifted, exchanged, or sold between users.\n</p>Privacy Preferred Merchant Program<p> Privacy offers the Privacy Preferred Merchant Program to allow our customers to earn cashback on purchases completed through Privacy\u2019s browser

other sites before completing your purchase or use coupons not provided by Privacy, you may not be eligible to earn cashback on your purchase.\nIf you disable \u201ccookies\u201d on your computer, you will not be able to earn cashback because cookies are used to verify that your Privacy Account is eligible for the cashback.\nPlease note, however, that if cookies from other promotional offers for the merchant are already present on your computer, we will not modify them.\n</p>Affiliate Store Policies<p> A product purchased from any Affiliate Store through the Program, is governed by and subject to the applicable Affiliate Store\u2019s policies, including applicable exchange and shipping policies.\nYou agree that we are not agents of any Affiliate Store and that the Affiliate Stores

is solely between you and that Affiliate Store.\nWe do not assume any liability, obligation or responsibility for any part of such correspondence, offer or promotion, including, without limitation, the withdrawal or modification of any such offer or promotion.\nPrivacy is not responsible for changes to, or discontinuance of, any Affiliate Store, or for any Affiliate Store withdrawal from the Program, or for any effect on accrual of cashback caused by such changes, discontinuance, or withdrawal.\n</p>\n<p> The determination of whether a purchase made through an Privacy Affiliate Store qualifies for cashback is at the sole discretion of Privacy.\nIf an Affiliate Store fails to report a transaction to Privacy or fails to make payment to Privacy for any reason, Privacy reserves the right to cancel the cashback associated with that transaction.\n</p>Eligibility<p> Your eligibility to participate in any Privacy.com promotions is at our sole discretion.\nPrivacy.com reserves the

online access to one or more accounts that you maintain with a third-party financial institution and that you choose to designate for use in connection with the Payment Services (each, an

merchant.\n</p>Termination of Payment Services<p> Privacy may Terminate your use of the Payment Services at any time for any reason.\nAny termination of these terms does not relieve you of obligations to pay Fees or costs accrued prior to the termination, Chargebacks, and any other amounts owed to us as provided in these Payment Terms or the Terms of Service.\nIn the event your Privacy account has a negative balance, Privacy reserves the right to withhold refunds or credits to settle the negative balance.\nIf your access to Payment Services has been terminated, you may still be permitted to use
