your previous Terms here.</p>\n<p>Thanks for using Dropbox! Our mission is to create a more enlightened way of working by providing an intuitive, unified platform to keep your content safe and accessible while helping you and those you work with stay coordinated and in sync.\nThese terms of service (\u201c<strong>Terms</strong>\u201d) cover your use and access to our services, client software and websites (\"<strong>Services</strong>\").\nIf you reside outside of the United States of America, Canada and Mexico (\u201c<strong>North America</strong>\u201d) your agreement is with Dropbox International Unlimited Company.\nIf you reside in North America your agreement is with Dropbox, Inc.\nOur Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use your information while our Acceptable Use Policy outlines your responsibilities when using our Services.\nBy using our Services, you\u2019re agreeing to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy.</p> Your Stuff &amp.\nYour Permissions <p>When you use our Services, you provide us with things like your files, content, messages, contacts, and so on (\u201c<strong>Your Stuff</strong>\u201d).\nYour Stuff is yours.\nThese Terms don\u2019t give us any rights to Your Stuff except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.</p>\n<p>We need your permission to do things like hosting Your Stuff, backing it up, and sharing it when you ask us to.\nOur Services also provide you with features like commenting, sharing, searching, image thumbnails, document previews, optical character recognition (OCR), easy sorting and organization, and personalization to help reduce busywork.\nTo provide these and other features, Dropbox accesses, stores, and scans Your Stuff.\nYou give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.</p> Your Responsibilities <p> Your use of our Services must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy.\nContent in the Services may be protected by others\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nPlease don\u2019t copy, upload, download, or share content unless you have the right to do so.</p>\n<p>Dropbox may review your conduct and content for

your password to the Services, and keep your account information current.\nDon\u2019t share your account credentials or give others access to your account.</p>\n<p>You may use our Services only as permitted by applicable law, including export control laws and regulations.\nFinally, to use our Services, you must be at least 13 (or older, depending on where you live).</p> Software <p>Some of our Services allow you to download client software (\u201c<strong>Software</strong>\u201d) which may update automatically.\nSo long as you comply with these Terms, we give you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services.\nTo the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we\u2019ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms.\nUnless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p> Beta Services <p>We sometimes release products and features that we\u2019re still testing and evaluating (\u201cBeta

meanings) and may not be as reliable as Dropbox\u201ds other services.\nBeta Services are made available so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback.</p>\n<p>Beta Services are confidential until official launch.\nIf you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to anyone else without our permission.</p> Our Stuff <p>The Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other US and foreign laws.\nThese Terms don\u2019t grant you any right, title, or interest

to you.</p> Copyright <p>We respect the intellectual property of others and ask that you do too.\nWe respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported using our Copyright Policy.\nWe reserve the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing and terminate accounts of repeat infringers.\nOur designated agent for notice of alleged copyright infringement on the Services is:</p>\n<p>Copyright Agent<br> Dropbox, Inc.<br> 1800 Owens St<br> San Francisco, CA 94158<br> copyright@dropbox.com</p> Paid Accounts <p>\n<em>Billing.</em> You can increase your storage space and add paid features to your account (turning your account into a \u201cPaid Account\u201d).\nWe\u2019ll automatically bill you from the date you convert to a Paid Account and on each periodic renewal until cancellation.\nIf you\u2019re on an annual plan, we\u2019ll send you a notice email reminding you that your plan is about to renew within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date.\nYou\u2019re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we\u2019ll charge tax when required to do so.\nSome countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn\u2019t override these laws.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No Refunds.</em> You may cancel your Dropbox Paid Account at any time.\nRefunds are only issued if required by law.\nFor example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid Account.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Downgrades.</em> Your Paid Account will remain in effect until it's cancelled or terminated under these Terms.\nIf you don\u2019t pay for your Paid Account on time, we reserve the right to suspend it or remove Paid Account features.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Changes.</em> We may change the fees in effect but will give you advance notice of these changes via a message to the email address associated with your account.</p> Dropbox Business Teams <p>\n<em>Email address.</em> If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Business or Education team (collectively, \u201cDropbox Business Team\u201d) or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Using Dropbox Business Teams.</em> If you join a Dropbox Business Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization\u2019s terms and policies.\nPlease note that Dropbox Business Team accounts are subject to your organization's control.\nYour administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or from your Dropbox Business Team account.\nThey may also be able to restrict or terminate your access to a Dropbox Business Team account.\nIf you convert an existing Dropbox account into part of a Dropbox Business Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox Business Team.</p> Termination <p>You\u2019re free to stop using our Services at any time.\nWe reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>\n<p>(a) you\u2019re in breach of these Terms,</p>\n<p>(b) your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or</p>\n<p>(c) you don\u2019t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services.\nIf after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we\u2019ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>\n<p>We won\u2019t provide notice before termination where:</p>\n<p>(a) you\u2019re in material breach of these Terms,</p>\n<p>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or</p>\n<p>(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</p> Discontinuation of Services <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Dropbox\u2019s control or to comply with a legal requirement.\nIf we do so, we\u2019ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems.\nIf we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we\u2019ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p> Services \u201cAS IS\u201d <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nSome places don\u2019t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p> Limitation of Liability <p>WE DON\u2019T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO\u2014THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES.\nIN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN\u2019T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU.\nTHIS PARAGRAPH DOESN\u2019T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON\u2019T BE LIABLE FOR:</p>\n<p>i.\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</p>\n<p>ii.\nANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</p>\n<p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n<p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.\nDROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN\u2019T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p>\n<p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX.</p> Resolving Disputes <p>\n<em>Let\u2019s Try to Sort Things Out First.</em> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.\nBefore filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com.\nWe\u2019ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Judicial Forum for Disputes.</em> You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below.\nBoth you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.\nIf you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn\u2019t affect those requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU\u2019RE A U.S.\nRESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</em> You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.\nThis includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account.\nHowever, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures.</em> The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nThe arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</em> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nDropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000.\nIf you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.\nDropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work.\nEither party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\nIf the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong>\n</em>.\nYou may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren\u2019t allowed.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section will be deemed void.</p> Controlling Law <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.\nHowever, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country.\nThis paragraph doesn\u2019t override those laws.</p> Entire Agreement <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.\nThese Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p> Waiver, Severability &amp.\nAssignment <p>Dropbox\u2019s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.\nIf a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.\nYou may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.\nDropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p> Modifications <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>\n<p>(a) changes to the law,</p>\n<p>(b) new regulatory requirements, or</p>\n<p>(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</p>\n<p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we\u2019ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification.\nThese updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective.\nWhere applicable, we\u2019ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date.\nBy continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\n<p>If your organization signed a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise Agreement with Dropbox, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below.\nPlease contact your organization\u2019s Admin for details.</p> Dropbox Privacy Policy <p>Posted: December 17, 2019</p>\n<p>Effective: January 1, 2020</p>\n<p>You can see the previous Privacy Policy here.</p>\n<p> Thanks for using Dropbox! Here we describe how we collect, use, and handle your personal data when you use our websites, software, and services (\u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201d).\nFor more information and details, please

authentication (like your name, email address, phone number, payment info, and physical address).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your Stuff.</em> Our Services are designed as a simple and personalized way for you to store your files, documents, photos, comments, messages, and so on (\u201c<strong>Your Stuff</strong>\u201d), collaborate with others, and work across multiple devices and services.\nTo make that possible, we store, process, and transmit Your Stuff as well as information related to it.\nThis related information includes your profile information that makes it easier to collaborate and share Your Stuff with others, as well as things like the size of the file, the time it was uploaded, collaborators, and usage activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Contacts.</em> You may choose to give us access to your contacts to make it easy for you to do things like share and collaborate on Your Stuff, send messages, and invite others to use the Services.\nIf you do, we\u2019ll store those contacts on our servers for you to use.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Usage information.</em> We collect information related to how you use the Services, including actions you take in your account (like sharing, editing, viewing, creating and moving files or folders).\nWe use this information to provide, improve, and promote our Services, and protect Dropbox users.\nPlease refer to our FAQ for more information about how we use this usage information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Device information.</em> We also collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services.\nThis includes things like IP addresses, the

location information to the Services.\nFor example, we use device information to detect abuse and identify and troubleshoot bugs.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Cookies and other technologies.</em> We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect, and promote our Services.\nFor example, cookies help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based on that information.\nYou can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.\nIf our systems receive a DNT:1 signal from your browser, we\u2019ll respond to that signal as outlined here.\nWe may also use third-party service providers that set cookies and similar technologies to promote Dropbox services.\nYou can learn more about how cookies and similar technologies work, as well as how to opt out of the use of them for advertising purposes,

nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Services.\nTo the extent any component of the Software may be offered under an open source license, we\u2019ll make that license available to you and the provisions of that license may expressly override some of these Terms.\nUnless the following restrictions are prohibited by law, you agree not to reverse engineer or decompile the Services, attempt to do so, or assist anyone in doing so.</p> Beta Services <p>We sometimes release products and features that we\u2019re still testing and evaluating (\u201cBeta

within a reasonable period of time prior to the renewal date.\nYou\u2019re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we\u2019ll charge tax when required to do so.\nSome countries have mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights, and this paragraph doesn\u2019t override these laws.</p>\n<p>\n<em>No Refunds.</em> You may cancel your Dropbox Paid Account at any time.\nRefunds are only issued if required by law.\nFor example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their Paid Account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a Paid

address associated with your account.</p> Dropbox Business Teams <p>\n<em>Email address.</em> If you sign up for a Dropbox account with an email address provisioned by your organization, your organization may be able to block your use of Dropbox until you transition to an account on a Dropbox Business or Education team (collectively, \u201cDropbox Business Team\u201d) or you associate your Dropbox account with a personal email address.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Using Dropbox Business Teams.</em> If you join a Dropbox Business Team, you must use it in compliance with your organization\u2019s terms and policies.\nPlease note that Dropbox Business Team accounts are subject to your organization's control.\nYour administrators may be able to access, disclose, restrict, or remove information in or

Dropbox Business Team, your administrators may prevent you from later disassociating your account from the Dropbox Business Team.</p> Termination <p>You\u2019re free to stop using our Services at any time.\nWe reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Services with notice to you if:</p>\n<p>(a) you\u2019re in breach of these Terms,</p>\n<p>(b) your use of the Services would cause a real risk of harm or loss to us or other users, or</p>\n<p>(c) you don\u2019t have a Paid Account and haven't accessed our Services for 12 consecutive months.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice via the email address associated with your account to remedy the activity that prompted us to contact you and give you the opportunity to export Your Stuff from our Services.\nIf after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we\u2019ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>\n<p>We won\u2019t provide notice before termination where:</p>\n<p>(a) you\u2019re in material breach of these Terms,</p>\n<p>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or</p>\n<p>(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</p> Discontinuation of Services <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Dropbox\u2019s control or to comply with a legal requirement.\nIf we do so, we\u2019ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems.\nIf we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we\u2019ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p> Services \u201cAS IS\u201d <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nSome places don\u2019t allow the disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p> Limitation of Liability <p>WE DON\u2019T EXCLUDE OR LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WHERE IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL TO DO SO\u2014THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES.\nIN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN\u2019T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU.\nTHIS PARAGRAPH DOESN\u2019T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON\u2019T BE LIABLE FOR:</p>\n<p>i.\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</p>\n<p>ii.\nANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</p>\n<p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n<p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.\nDROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN\u2019T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p>\n<p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX.</p> Resolving Disputes <p>\n<em>Let\u2019s Try to Sort Things Out First.</em> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.\nBefore filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com.\nWe\u2019ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Judicial Forum for Disputes.</em> You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below.\nBoth you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.\nIf you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn\u2019t affect those requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU\u2019RE A U.S.\nRESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</em> You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.\nThis includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account.\nHowever, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures.</em> The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nThe arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</em> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nDropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000.\nIf you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.\nDropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work.\nEither party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.\nIf the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California to resolve your claim.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong>\n</em>.\nYou may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren\u2019t allowed.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section will be deemed void.</p> Controlling Law <p>These Terms will be governed by California law except for its conflicts of laws principles.\nHowever, some countries (including those in the European Union) have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer's country.\nThis paragraph doesn\u2019t override those laws.</p> Entire Agreement <p>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Dropbox with respect to the subject matter of these Terms, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Terms.\nThese Terms create no third party beneficiary rights.</p> Waiver, Severability &amp.\nAssignment <p>Dropbox\u2019s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later.\nIf a provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.\nYou may not assign any of your rights under these Terms, and any such attempt will be void.\nDropbox may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p> Modifications <p>We may revise these Terms from time to time to better reflect:</p>\n<p>(a) changes to the law,</p>\n<p>(b) new regulatory requirements, or</p>\n<p>(c) improvements or enhancements made to our Services.</p>\n<p>If an update affects your use of the Services or your legal rights as a user of our Services, we\u2019ll notify you prior to the update's effective date by sending an email to the email address associated with your account or via an in-product notification.\nThese updated terms will be effective no less than 30 days from when we notify you.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t agree to the updates we make, please cancel your account before they become effective.\nWhere applicable, we\u2019ll offer you a prorated refund based on the amounts you have prepaid for Services and your account cancellation date.\nBy continuing to use or access the Services after the updates come into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>\n<p>If your organization signed a Dropbox Business or Dropbox Enterprise Agreement with Dropbox, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below.\nPlease contact your organization\u2019s Admin for details.</p> Dropbox Privacy Policy <p>Posted: December 17, 2019</p>\n<p>Effective: January 1,

helps you sync up with teams you can join and helps other users share files and folders with you.\n</p>\n<p>Certain features let you make additional information available to others.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Other applications.</em> You can choose to connect your Dropbox account with third-party services\u2013\u2013for example, via Dropbox APIs.\nBy doing so, you\u2019re enabling

Services.\nIf after such notice you fail to take the steps we ask of you, we\u2019ll terminate or suspend your access to the Services.</p>\n<p>We won\u2019t provide notice before termination where:</p>\n<p>(a) you\u2019re in material breach of these Terms,</p>\n<p>(b) doing so would cause us legal liability or compromise our ability to provide the Services to our other users, or</p>\n<p>(c) we're prohibited from doing so by law.</p> Discontinuation of Services <p>We may decide to discontinue the Services in response to unforeseen circumstances beyond Dropbox\u2019s control or to comply with a legal requirement.\nIf we do so, we\u2019ll give you reasonable prior notice so that you can export Your Stuff from our systems.\nIf we discontinue the Services in this way before the end of any fixed or minimum term you have paid us for, we\u2019ll refund the portion of the fees you have pre-paid but haven't received Services for.</p> Services \u201cAS IS\u201d <p>We strive to provide great Services, but there are certain things that we can't guarantee.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES.\nTHE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nSome places

SO\u2014THIS INCLUDES ANY LIABILITY FOR DROPBOX\u2019S OR ITS AFFILIATES\u2019 FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION IN PROVIDING THE SERVICES.\nIN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EXCLUSIONS AREN\u2019T ALLOWED, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO YOU ONLY FOR LOSSES AND DAMAGES THAT ARE A REASONABLY FORESEEABLE RESULT OF OUR FAILURE TO USE REASONABLE CARE AND SKILL OR OUR BREACH OF OUR CONTRACT WITH YOU.\nTHIS PARAGRAPH DOESN\u2019T AFFECT CONSUMER RIGHTS THAT CAN'T BE WAIVED OR LIMITED BY ANY CONTRACT OR AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>IN COUNTRIES WHERE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY ARE ALLOWED, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WON\u2019T BE LIABLE FOR:</p>\n<p>i.\nANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR</p>\n<p>ii.\nANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY.</p>\n<p>THESE EXCLUSIONS OR LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT DROPBOX OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n<p>IF YOU USE THE SERVICES FOR ANY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, OR RE-SALE PURPOSE, DROPBOX, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, LOSS OF BUSINESS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY.\nDROPBOX AND ITS AFFILIATES AREN\u2019T RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES.</p>\n<p>OTHER THAN FOR THE TYPES OF LIABILITY WE CANNOT LIMIT BY LAW (AS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION), WE LIMIT OUR LIABILITY TO YOU TO THE GREATER OF $20 USD OR 100% OF ANY AMOUNT YOU'VE PAID UNDER YOUR CURRENT SERVICE PLAN WITH DROPBOX.</p> Resolving Disputes <p>\n<em>Let\u2019s Try to Sort Things Out First.</em> We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.\nBefore filing a claim against Dropbox, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting dispute-notice@dropbox.com.\nWe\u2019ll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or Dropbox may bring a formal proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Judicial Forum for Disputes.</em> You and Dropbox agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Terms or the Services will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below.\nBoth you and Dropbox consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.\nIf you reside in a country (for example, a member state of the European Union) with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, this paragraph doesn\u2019t affect those requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU\u2019RE A U.S.\nRESIDENT, YOU ALSO AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>We Both Agree to Arbitrate.</em> You and Dropbox agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.\nThis includes disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this \u201cMandatory Arbitration Provisions\u201d section, including its enforceability, revocability, or validity.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by clicking here and submitting the opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account.\nHowever, if you agreed to a previous version of these Terms that allowed you to opt out of arbitration, your previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Procedures.</em> The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nThe arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, San Francisco (CA), or any other location we agree to.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Fees and Incentives.</em> The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nDropbox will pay all arbitration fees for individual arbitration for claims less than $75,000.\nIf you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.\nDropbox will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.</em> Either you or Dropbox may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where you live or work.\nEither party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent
