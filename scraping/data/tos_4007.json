compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future.\nIn order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.</p>\n<p>g.\n<b>Headings</b>.\nThe section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only
