Periods</i>\n</p>\n<p>We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The amount, nature and sensitivity of your information</li>\n<li>The reasons for which we collect and process the personal data</li>\n<li>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Site and/or Services</li>\n<li>Applicable legal requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide our Services.\nNote, however, that with respect to our Customers with active accounts, we may retain certain essential account information, but otherwise regularly delete other information that is less essential to the provision of our Services in order to minimize our storage of data.\nWe also will retain personal information that we\u2019ve collected from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).\nAdditionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (also known as a \u201clitigation hold\u201d).\nIn this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims.\nWhen we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\nFor any questions about data retention, please contact security@krisp.ai.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Anonymization</i>\n</p>\n<p>In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your personal data instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance.\nWhen we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.</p>\nOPTING-OUT OF MARKETING\n<p>You may opt-out at any time of marketing that we may send you by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in each email, or you may contact us directly at security@krisp.ai.</p>\nNOTICE TO NEVADA CONSUMERS\n<p>We do not sell your personal information within the scope of, and according to the defined meaning

circumstances, you may ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless it remains necessary for us to continue processing your personal data for a legitimate business need or to comply with a legal obligation as permitted under the GDPR, in which case we will inform you)</li>\n<li>The right to restrict processing: your right, under certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data</li>\n<li>The right to data portability: your right to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file)</li>\n<li>The right to

requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law.\nIn addition, we will always balance your rights against those of other data subjects in connection with any requests, and in some cases this may require us to redact our responses or deny a request.</p>\n<p>If you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may
