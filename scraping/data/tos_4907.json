Rd.<br> Suite 520<br> Toronto, Ontario, Canada<br> M2H 3P8<br>\n<br>\n<strong>RULES AND REGULATIONS</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.0] Account</strong>\n<br>\nAn account is issued to a player in accordance with the account policy.\nThis section of the document further discusses the legal actions which will be executed to an account due to any violation.\nEach account holder must respect all other players in a professional and courteous manner and is fully responsible for all violations incurred by his/her account.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.1] Warning</strong>\n<br>\nA warning is issued to a player for an offense which is considered a minor breaking of the games, forums, or other rules and may include minor illegal act the most common violation of which is due to lack of knowledge or harmless offense which may be easily prevented.\nThis is a cautious response to the player to acknowledge that he/she has performed an act that is not allowed.\nIf a similar act(s) is continued, second level of action will be conducted in accordance with the account policy, penalty items may be inserted into the offender's account, removal of specific items from the offenders account, removal of funds from the offenders account, or more sever actions may also be taken if deemed necessary.\nIn some extreme cases, warnings may not be issued and immediate action may be taken against the account.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.2] Simple Suspension</strong>\n<br>\nA simple suspension of the account is issued to a player who has committed a violation for which he/she was previously warned.\nA simple suspension is used to remove the player off the server for a short period of time to ensure he/she understands the importance of a violation free environment.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.3] Extreme Suspension</strong>\n<br>\nA suspension that is lengthy in duration and applied to a violating account.\nThis is often caused by a serious offense in accordance with Suba Games Terms and Conditions or the Forum Rules and Regulations.\nExtreme suspension is a consequence for situations where the offender may or may not have been warned numerous times and/or has been previously given a simple suspension.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.4] Account Closure</strong>\n<br>\nAccount closure is by far the highest level of punishment to an active account.\nThis course of action is utilized at situations where an offense may not be tolerated any further.\nIn other words, the offender has far exceeded the point in which any warning and/or suspension is applicable.\nUpon completion of an account closure, the entire account may be permanently deleted as well as the offender is prohibited to attend any matters relating to the game.\nHereafter, the account will not be revoked for any reason.\nSevere acts or a large accumulation of small acts may not receive any warnings and can lead to account closure immediately.\nAccounts related to the offender's account may also be banned depending on the circumstances that the original account was banned under.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.5] Chat Penalties</strong>\n<br>\nThe chat window is a primary medium of communication amongst players.\nCurrently, the chat window allows players to exchange information through multiple different levels which determine who may see the messages in respect to a range.\nThese messages are constantly filtered for English only.\nHowever, players often find ways to send the message using distinct words and/or characters which do not get filtered.\nThese players are at a risk of losing their privileges to chat altogether or face harsher consequences.\nHence, it is very important to use appropriate terms of communication while respecting all other players rights at all times.\nPlayers who are identified as presenting offensive, inappropriate, aggressive, racial, discriminative, sexual, violent, or any other language we define as simply unacceptable may be warned at first, or immediately penalized in more extreme cases.\nIf this behavior still continues, suspension of the offender's account or other penalties may be enforced.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[1.5.1] Levels of Communication</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>[A]</strong> Area Chats - Messages are visible to all players who are roaming around a certain range of the sender, in a party or part of clan or other related player groups respectively.\nWithin these levels of chat, general terms that are widely accepted and used daily are acceptable since there is limitation for visibility of messages sent.<br>\n<strong>[B]</strong> Global / Trade Chats - Messages processed here are seen by everyone within the channel.\nThus, players must abide by the rules discussed above in this level of chat.\notherwise a punishment will be issued accordingly.<br>\n<strong>[C]</strong> Leadership or players with in-game authority - Messages processed here are seen by everyone within the nation regardless of ignore setting.\nThus, players must abide by the rules discussed above in this level of chat.\notherwise a punishment will be issued accordingly.<br>\n<strong>[D]</strong> In-Game Mail or Messaging - Letters processed here are seen only by the recipient of the message.\nWithin this level of communication, general terms that are widely accepted and used daily are acceptable.\nHowever when used as a means of spamming other players with messages or sending repeated messages with inappropriate content, a punishment will be issued accordingly.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[2.0] Naming Conventions</strong>\n<br>\nCharacter and Clan / Player group names are the only way of referencing a player in the game environment.\nThese names may be meaningful and attractive.\nHowever, they may not portray content that is considered pedophiliac, racially/ethnically inappropriate, sexual, violent, national sexual orientation and Obscene/Vulgar, or in any other form of inappropriate naming.\nThus, great care should be given to name selection.\nThe first impression other players have of you will be based on your character's name, so it's best to start off on the right foot.\nWhile choosing the perfect name for your character is left to your discretion, we have determined that some types of names are not allowed in this game, forum, or any other part of SUBA Games.\nInappropriate naming conventions can be changed by SUBA Game GM's at their own discretion and these decisions cannot be contested.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[2.1] Sexual Content</strong>\n<br>\nCharacter names which imply any sexual content of any kind is inappropriate and thus not tolerated.\nThis may include words describing sexual behavior or imagery.\n[2.2] Racial/Derogatory/Discriminative/Disability Terms\nRacial, derogatory, discriminative and/or disability terms are offensive and not attractive to other players in the game.\nSuch names which depict any type of the above mentioned content either implicitly or explicitly is prohibited by rules that govern this convention.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[2.3] Harassment in Names</strong>\n<br>\nCharacter names that portray any kind of harassment at any degree are not tolerated and will be considered a serious offense.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[3.0] PvP (Player versus Player)</strong>\n<br>\nEvery player must respect and realize that each player has equal rights in the game.\nTherefore, battles may not be initiated through the means of repeated requests for a duel if they are not interested in the battle.\nPlayers who constantly violate this rule will be punished accordingly.\nOpen war battles are excluded from this as they are a necessary component of gameplay.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[4.0] Impersonation</strong>\n<br>\nThe term impersonation is an implication of the act of mimicking another player, GM (Game Masters) or administrator.\nThis course of action often leads to misunderstanding, fraud or other illegal operations.\nIf at any time a player is identified as a participant of the above act, he/she will be punished according to the degree of imitation as well as the consequence of the act.\nBe very cautious concerning your behavior within the game environment as some acts may result with a severe penalty regardless of any status.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[4.1] Account Status</strong>\n<br>\nThere are different levels of accounts that cannot be impersonated under any circumstances.\nThese levels are as follows:<br>\n<strong>[A]</strong> GM (Game Master) - These are paid employees that manage the game services in the SUBA Games Portal.\nThese individuals have full account powers in-game and in the community services.<br>\n<strong>[B]</strong> CM (Community Manager) - These are paid employees that manage the various community services that the SUBA Games Portal provides.\nThese individuals may or may not have in-game powers but are certain to have full account powers in the community services.<br>\n<strong>[C]</strong> Moderator - These are volunteer players that assist the GM and the CM in managing the community services.\nThe selection of Moderators can only be done by GM's and CM's of SUBA Games.\nThese individuals do not have any in-game powers and have minimal community service powers.<br>\n<strong>[D]</strong> Player - These are the regular accounts available to everyone when they create an account in the SUBA Games Portal.\nThey have no authority or powers in any part of the SUBA Games Portal.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[5.0] Harassment</strong>\n<br>\nHarassment is often an issue at any situation, which causes insecurity, lack of interest in the game environment and during some situations may pose a threat.\nHarassment may include calling inappropriate names, producing offensive or negative remarks which may be directed to a single player or a group of players, passing rumors or any message in the chat window that is considered offensive in accordance with the \"Game Policy\".<br>\nThus, harassment of any kind regardless of the degree of harassment is not tolerated under any circumstances.\nThese matters are taken into serious consideration since the security and the interest of our players are highly important to the nature of our business.\nTreat each and every player the way you would like to be treated.\nAny level of harassment involving anything related to SUBA Games will be looked into.\nPlayers must also refrain from using people of authority as a means to influence other players.\nthis would also be considered as harassment.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[5.1] Harassment of SUBA Staff and other affiliated groups.</strong>\n<br>\nHarassment to SUBA Staff and/or any other affiliated groups such as the volunteer moderators, business partners and other affiliates (including the family of such affiliates) will not be tolerated.\nAny excessive harassment may result in a suspension of the offenders account.\nIf the offense is repeated again, the penalties may be more severe upon each subsequent violation and may require legal actions.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[6.0] Scams</strong>\n<br>\nThe term scam applies to gaining any kind of advantage, item, property or information through the use of deception.\nwhat constitutes a scam is at the discretion of SUBA GMs and not all examples are listed here.\nTherefore, it is a number one concern regarding our players and all necessary actions will be taken to prevent violation of any sort which may lead to scams.\nNever give out your personal account information unless requested by a trusted GM outside the game.\nOnly in extreme conditions will a GM ask for account info, and that is only after a problem has been reported.\nA list of current GMs is always available on the forums.\nGMs always have a tag noting their position such as [GM]Admin(in the SUBA Games forum).\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[6.1] In Game Scams</strong>\n<br>\nThese include scams which occur within the vicinity of the game environment by misleading a player.\nThey include the following: impersonating a guild member, party member, friend or any other team member to exchange valuable item(s), advantage or information.\nScams may also include trades that involve deception of the actual trade transaction.\nGMs (Game Masters) will never request a player for their password or other personal information inside the game environment.\nTherefore, do not ever provide any information (or an in-game item) to anyone including, but not limited to, your family members and friends.\nPlease keep your account information secure.\nWe do not take any responsibility for any player's loss.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[6.2] Other Scams</strong>\n<br>\nOther scams may relate to factors that are outside (external) of player accounts.\nAny player who utilizes outside means of achieving information, items or property (including user accounts) will fall under this category of scams.\nThese scams may include: using fraud emails to obtain passwords or other account information, selling or buying of user accounts and using real life transactions to buy an in-game item or information or advantage.\nWe do not take any responsibility for any players loss due to a real life transaction that is executed between two or more players.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[6.3] Item Mall/Shop Scams</strong>\n<br>\nSUBA Games does not authorize any trading of Item Mall equipment for credits, items, or any other in-game benefit.\nThe Item Mall is only for a player's personal use or for use as free gifts for other players.\nWe do not take any responsibility for a player's loss due to a transaction that is executed between two or more players involving Item Mall equipment.\nEquipment, in-game currency, and/or Item Mall benefits will not be recovered or restored.\nPlayers who are found to be utilizing the Item Mall for scams will have their accounts suspended and/or permanently banned.\nPlayers who are involved in charge-backs and/or other fraudulent activities related to our Item Mall/Shop, PayPal, or a Credit Card will be reported to the appropriate legal authorities and their accounts will be permanently banned.\nPlayers who receive Item Mall gifts related to these fraudulent activities will also have their accounts suspended and/or permanently banned.\nPlayers are required to report any Item Mall gifts they receive from suspicious senders.\nFailure to report these Item Mall gifts will result in a permanent ban when the sender is involved in a chargeback or another fraudulent activity.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>[6.4] Tips to Avoid Scams</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>[A]</strong> Do not give out any personal or account information to anyone in the game or to players outside of the game via email or through any medium.<br>\n<strong>[B]</strong> Always keep your account information safe and
