preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2.\nIn such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Clause 9</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Governing law</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established, namely: [Country].</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Clause 10</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Variation of the contract</b>\n</p>\n<p>The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses.\nThis does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Clause 11</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sub-processing</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.\nWhere the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses.\nWhere the sub-processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor\u2019s obligations under such agreement.</li>\n<li>\nThe prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law.\nSuch third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\nThe provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established, namely: [Country].&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year.\nThe list shall be available to the data exporter\u2019s data protection supervisory authority.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Clause 12</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Obligations after the termination of personal data-processing services</b>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred.\nIn that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.</li>\n<li>The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dated:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>On behalf of the
