marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Scaleway may also use your data to respect its legal obligations (including under anti-fraud and money-laundering laws and the legislation on late payments and payment defaults) and/or to reply to requests submitted by public and governmental bodies.\nThese data will be retained for the legal period only.</p>\n3.\nYour preferences regarding the collection and use of your data\n<p>You may access your data, rectify it, request its erasure, object to processing on legitimate grounds relating to your particular situation and exercise your right to data portability,
