conditions (\"the Conditions\") govern the use of the goods and services (jointly referred to as \"the Services\") offered by Blade Global Corporation (\u201cBlade\u201d)\u2013 in particular, access to Shadow\u00ae, a service which provides subscription access to a remote personal computer, and use of the website&nbsp;shadow.tech, and all other websites of Blade and its affiliates (\"the Websites\").\nThey constitute a contract between you (\"the User\") and Blade (jointly referred to as \"the Parties\").\nThese Conditions, as well as the&nbsp;Confidentiality Policy&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Cookies Charter&nbsp;must be accepted to access the Services.</p>\n<p>Please read these Conditions carefully.\nBy using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Conditions, including the Confidentiality Policy, the Cookies Charter and the Code of Conduct herein, and all other terms and policies incorporated herein by reference.&nbsp.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THIS WEBSITE OR OUR SERVICES.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT: THESE CONDITIONS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, WHICH INCLUDES A WAIVER OF THE USER RIGHT TO BRING CLAIMS AS CLASS ACTIONS AND THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE FOREGOING PROVISION.\nTHESE PROVISIONS AFFECT USER\u2019S RIGHTS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO ALL SERVICES.</p>\n<p>Some of the Services offered by Blade may, where applicable, be subject to special conditions, which once accepted by the User will supplement and prevail over these Conditions for the Services concerned.</p>Definitions<p>To facilitate the understanding and interpretation of the terms in these Conditions, whether used in the singular or the plural, or unless the context otherwise requires or except as otherwise expressly provided, the Parties have agreed on the following definitions:</p>\n<p>\"Intellectual Property Assets\" refers to intellectual works protected by the provisions of French and international intellectual property law and, in particular, the Websites and Software.</p>\n<p>\"Third-Party Applications\" refers to third-party software, applications, websites and services that are included in the Services or may be accessed, purchased or subscribed to through the Services.</p>\n<p>\"User Account\" refers to the User's personal account that may be accessed using a user name and password.</p>\n<p>\"Conditions\" refers to this contract concluded between the User and Blade.</p>\n<p>\"Subscription Start Date\" refers to the date the Shadow\u00ae remote computer is put into service.</p>\n<p>\"Data\" refers to all the data submitted by the User to Blade, as stated in the paragraph \"User's data and content\".</p>\n<p>\"Licence\" refers to the Windows licence used in connection with the Services.</p>\n<p>\"Software\" refers to all the software made available to the User by Blade as part of the Services.</p>\n<p>\"Subscription Period\" is defined in the paragraph \"Shadow: subscription\".</p>\n<p>\"Services\" refers to all the benefits, goods and services offered by Blade to the User.</p>\n<p>\"Terminal\" is defined in the paragraph \"Shadow\".</p>\n<p>\"Third-Party Terminal\" is defined in the paragraph \"Shadow\".</p>Capacity<p>The Services are not intended for, and may not be used by people under the age of 13.\nBy using the Services, the User represents and warrants to Blade that he/she has at least 13 years of age and is lawfully able to accept these Conditions, and purchase and/or use the Services.</p>Identification Documentation<p>To take out a subscription, Blade may ask the User to provide a copy of his or her valid identification document or any other proof of identity, before the start of or during the subscription.\nThe User has ten (10) calendar days to send Blade any documents requested starting from the date of the first request.</p>\n<p>If the User does not meet this condition, Blade may refuse his or her subscription request, or may suspend or cancel the subscription without prior notice if it has already started, in which case the subscription fee will be due until the date of cancellation.</p>Shadow<p>Shadow\u00ae offers the User access to a remote personal computer by&nbsp;subscription.</p>\n<p>This computer works in a similar way to a standard PC in that Users can install their own&nbsp;software and store their own data and content, which are available every time they connect to the device.\nUsers can also link it to&nbsp;compatible peripherals&nbsp;(printers, joysticks, etc.).\nUnless indicated otherwise as part of the Service subscription, the&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;for this computer is Windows 10 Home.</p>\n<p>Shadow\u00ae may be accessed using several devices (PCs, tablets, mobile telephones, smart TVs) (\"a Third-Party Terminal\") which run on an operating system for which Blade has developed and made available a software for (jointly referred to as \"the Software\").\nBlade does not guarantee that a Software for a specific third-party operating system will remain available at all time during the Subscription Period.</p>\n<p>For an optimal experience, Shadow\u00ae may also be accessed using a specific&nbsp;terminal&nbsp;developed by Blade (\"the Terminal\").\nThis Terminal (for example, the Shadow Ghost Terminal), must be connected to a screen and a keyboard and/or a mouse, which are not provided by Blade unless indicated otherwise.</p>\n<p>Technically, in both cases, the User's inputs (keystrokes, moving the mouse, etc.) are sent from the Terminal or Third-Party Terminal to Blade's computer&nbsp;servers&nbsp;which process the information received and send a signal to the Terminal or Third-Party Terminal which enables it to display the image and play the corresponding sound on the User's screen.\nFor Shadow\u00ae to operate, the User must, therefore, be&nbsp;connected to the Internet, such Internet connection costs resting fully with the User.</p>Shadow Subscription<p>The User may be offered several subscription periods for accessing a Shadow\u00ae remote computer.</p>\n<p>The duration of subscription chosen by the User will be calculated from the date his or her Shadow\u00ae remote personal computer is put into service (\"the Subscription Start Date\", which may also be referred to as the activation date).</p>\n<p>If the User decides to&nbsp;rent&nbsp;or&nbsp;purchase a Terminal, the Subscription Start Date will not be deferred until the delivery date of the Terminal.</p>\n<p>The subscription will continue from the Subscription Start Date for the term chosen by the User when subscribing to the Service (\"the Subscription Period\").</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified during the subscription of the Service, and unless the User has not cancelled his or her subscription or chosen&nbsp;another subscription term&nbsp;the day before it ends, at the latest, through actions available on his or her User Account, or at least ten (10) days before it ends if the request has been made by any other means made available to the User (postal letter, message to the Support Department etc.), it will be automatically renewed without notice, to the extent legally permissible, for the same term as the current Subscription Period and under the same conditions, unless the conditions have been amended by Blade.\nIt is understood that the above mentioned timings mean from the receipt of the request by Blade, and not from the date of the request being sent.</p>Subscription Fee<p>The cost of the Services is the price indicated to the User when taking out the subscription.</p>\n<p>Blade shall inform the User if it wishes to change the price of the Services, by giving a reasonable period of notice before the date the change takes effect.\nIn the case of price increases,&nbsp.\nUsers will therefore be required to agree to the new price conditions if they intend to continue their subscription contract after the date the new conditions take effect.\nThey can do so via the pop-up containing a description of the new conditions and which appears the first time the User connects after Blade has adopted the new price conditions, if applicable, or through any other means Blade chose to inform the User.\nIf the User has not agreed to the new price conditions by the date they take effect, Blade may, at its sole discretion, (a) cancel the subscription at the end of the current Subscription Period on the date the new conditions take effect, (b) keep on providing the Services at the same price, or (c) transition the User subscription to the plan which is most similar to the User then-current subscription.</p>Payment Dates<p>Users who take out a one (1) month subscription will be charged the amount of the subscription on the date it is taken out.\nIf their monthly subscription is renewed, the payment for the following month will be deducted one month after the date of subscription.\nIf the subscription is extended, the monthly payments will then be deducted every month on the same date.</p>\n<p>If a subscription is taken out for more than one (1) month, the subscription fee may be paid in the form of monthly payments or a prepayment, depending on the options offered by Blade to the User at the time subscription.</p>\n<p>For subscriptions taken out for more than one (1) month with monthly payments, Users will be debited an amount corresponding to the price of the first month of subscription on the date the subscription is taken out.\nThe next monthly payment will be debited one month after the date of subscription, and subsequent payments every month on the same date.</p>\n<p>For subscriptions taken out for more than one (1) month with a prepayment, payment will normally be made on the subscription date, unless otherwise indicated to the User at the time of subscription.</p>Online Payments<p>\n<strong>Method of payment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The cost of the Services may be paid online by bank card or any other means indicated on the Websites.\nPayments by bank cards will be debited immediately after the User's details have been verified, and once debit authorization has been received from the company that issued the bank card used by the User.\nIn accordance with applicable law, the commitment to pay by card is irrevocable.\nBy submitting his or her bank card details, the User authorises Blade to (a) store his or her bank information pursuant to our Privacy Policy and (b) automatically debit his or her bank card for the amount corresponding to the price of the Service subscribed, on a recurring basis, until the subscription has been cancelled and all sums due have been fully paid.\nThe User confirms that he or she is the holder of the bank card to be debited and that it is his or her name on the bank card.\nHe or she shall provide the sixteen-digit bank card number and expiry date, and if necessary, the CVV number.</p>\n<p>The User is responsible for ensuring that the bank card used for the payments is valid, that the conditions of use applicable to the card permit monthly payments to be debited for the Services, and that there are sufficient funds in the bank account to be debited.</p>\n<p>If a payment is rejected, Blade will inform the User as soon as possible to rectify the situation.</p>\n<p>The company will not, in any case, be held responsible in the case where the User were to make the payment of sums due by means other than those formally accepted by the Company, it being understood that the payment would then not free him or her from his or her obligation and should be made again according to a means of payment available to the User to this end.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disputed charges</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the User disputes a payment, a subscription charge, a fee or an interest charge, relating to the Services, for any reason, Blade reserves the right to suspend the User\u2019s access to the Services until any and all such disputes are settled.</p>\n<p>In the case of a User disputing charges on the basis that the subscription or purchase of the Services was taken out in a fraudulent manner, Blade reserves the right to terminate the Services as of right and without notice, and to take any legal action it deems appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Suspension of the account</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If payment is not made within three (3) calendar days, the User's access to the Service will be suspended.\nAfter this period of three (3) days, there is no guarantee that access to the Service will be provided again immediately after payment has been made.\nMoreover, if the User's access to the Services has been suspended as a result of late payment or non-payment, for any reason whatsoever, the full subscription fee shall remain due and the User will not be entitled to any refund in respect of the suspension period.\nIf the Service is cancelled by Blade as a result of non-payment (see Termination), the full fee must be paid to Blade immediately, for the current period until the end of the Subscription Period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Late payment fee</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event of late payment, the User will be liable to pay a lump-sum late payment fee equal to five (5) US dollars if the second attempt to debit the account fails.\nIf payment is not made after thirty (30) calendar days, the full sum due will bear an interest of 10% (ten percent) per annum, in addition to the lump sum payment.\nThe interest will be charged for each fifteen (15) day-period until the amount owed has been paid in full.\nEach fifteen (15) day-period started must be paid in full.\nThe User authorizes Blade to debit his or her bank card for the amount corresponding to the late payment fee and/or the interest, at the same time as payment of the subscription fee or by means of a separate payment, or to use any other means of payment chosen by the User to pay for his or her subscription fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reimbursement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the User is refunded by Blade, the reimbursement will be made, where possible, using the same means of payment used by the User to pay for his or her subscription fees.\nIf the means of payment used is no longer valid, the User must inform Blade of this before the refund is made to this means of payment.\nIn particular, if the User has changed bank branch, he or she must contact his or her former bank branch to ensure that the transfer has in fact been made to the new account or the funds have been deposited in a suspense account.\nThe payment made by Blade to the bank card or bank account provided by the User will release the Company from its commitment to the User.</p>Change of Subscription Term<p>The User may change the term of his or her future Subscription Period, before the end of each Subscription Period for the Shadow\u00ae Service, via his or her&nbsp;User Account.</p>\n<p>If the User chooses a longer subscription term, it will take effect on the next date the current monthly Subscription Period comes to term and as a result, the User will be subject to the new Subscription Period.</p>\n<p>If the User chooses a shorter subscription period, it will take effect at the end of the current Subscription Period and as a result, the User will be subject to the new Subscription Period.</p>\n<p>The User's term of commitment will therefore be renewed from the start date of the new Subscription Period until the end of the new Subscription Period.\nFor instance, if a User who has taken out a monthly subscription, the Subscription Start Date of which is June 15, decides to change to an annual subscription on July 6, his or her monthly subscription will continue until July 14, inclusive, and the annual subscription will start the following day.\nThe subscription will therefore run from July 15 until July 14 of the following year.</p>Change of subscription plan<p>\n<strong>1.\nSubscription to options</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Blade allows Users to subscribe to one or more options, or to change their subscription plan (for the subscription term, see Change of subscription period) via their User Account.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise indicated by Blade at the time of subscription to the options concerned, subscriptions to new options or changes in subscription plan requested by the User will take immediate effect (or within a reasonable time limit) and will be billed to the User on a pro rata basis, from the date the options or changes in subscription plan are activated, for a superior plan, until the end of the current Subscription Period.\nThese options will be tacitly renewed in the same way as the main offer.\nFor the terms on cancelling the options or changing to an inferior subscription plan, see Change of subscription plan.\nCancellation of options.</p>\n<p>The options will be billed on top of the main subscription offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nCancellation of options</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified by Blade on the occasion of the subscription to the options concerned, if the User would like to change to an inferior subscription plan (for the subscription term, see&nbsp;Change of subscription period) or cancel one or more options, the change and/or cancellation will take effect on the first day after the end of his or her current Subscription Period, even if the User stops using the options before the current Subscription Period has ended.\nFor example, if the Subscription Start Date is October 5 for a monthly subscription, and the User cancels the option on October 19, the change of plan or cancellation of the option will only take effect on November 5.</p>\n<p>If the User has subscribed to the option of adding one or more Additional Disk(s), it is his or her responsibility to ensure that all his or her information has been retrieved, including his or her&nbsp;Data, from the Additional Disk(s) by the effective date of cancellation of the option, or more generally, the cancellation of the subscription to Shadow\u00ae.\nBlade may immediately and permanently delete any data found on the Additional Disk(s) which is/are no longer subscribed to by the User, from the effective date of cancellation of the option in question or the cancellation of the subscription to Shadow\u00ae.</p>Shadow: Pre-orders<p>Orders or pre-ordered subscriptions to the Services, for instance Shadow\u00ae pre-orders, or pre-orders of Terminals, are subject to special conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cPre-order basis\u201d means that the Service purchased by the User is not yet available, or fully available, and therefore the time period for delivery of the Service to the User may be greater than usual.</p>\n<p>When pre-ordering, the User will be informed of when the Service may be accessed.\nThis is an estimate by Blade, at the date of subscription, of when the Service will be available for the User in question.\nThe time frame indicated may vary depending on the subscription term chosen by the User.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of pre-ordering, which consists of subscribing to a Service or buying a product which is not yet available, or fully available, on the date of subscription, the User accepts the risk that the Service or product will only be available after the date initially indicated.\nBlade will endeavor to meet the deadlines indicated, and to inform the User of any revised deadline in case of a delay.\nBlade cannot guarantee, however, that a Service or a product offered on a pre-order basis will be available on a particular date.</p>\n<p>In the same way as orders placed or subscriptions taken out without pre-ordering, the User will pay Blade, at the time of subscription, an amount corresponding to the price of one month of subscription or of the price of all or part of the order.\nLikewise, and in the same way as subscriptions taken out without pre-ordering, the subscription term will then be calculated from the&nbsp;<strong>Subscription Start Date</strong>, and for the period agreed.</p>\n<p>It is stipulated that Users who have pre-ordered Shadow\u00ae or have ordered a Service may, via their&nbsp;User Account, change the delivery address, provided it has not been dispatched, until Blade has informed the User that it has been dispatched and the delivery address can therefore no longer be changed.</p>Referral Program<p>Blade may offer Users certain benefits as part of its referral programs.</p>\n<p>Information on how these programs operate is provided on the Websites.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, referral programs are subject to the referring user's and new user's compliance with these Conditions, and to the condition that they are up-to-date with their payments due for the subscription.</p>\n<p>The User agrees to participate in the referral program in good faith.\nAny abuse of the referral programs, defined at the discretion of Blade, including self-referral or code spamming, will render the profits of referral programs, of whatever nature, null and void.</p>Software<p>Some Services enable the User to download Software.\nThe Software may, for example, enable the User to access his or her Shadow\u00ae remote personal computer via Third-Party Terminals.\nThis Software may be updated automatically.</p>\n<p>The Software is licensed and not sold.\nSubject to compliance with these Conditions, Blade grants the User a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable and revocable Software license, for private and non-commercial use worldwide, on compatible terminals belonging to the User only, for the sole purpose of enabling the User to access the Services.\nThe License is granted to the User for the duration of the subscription period, and will be automatically cancelled at the end of the period, regardless of the reason for terminating the contract.</p>\n<p>This user license includes the right to install and use a copy of the Software on each device.</p>\n<p>Blade or the third-party holders of the rights shall reserve all Software rights which have not been expressly granted in these Conditions.\nThe User is not authorized to (i) circumvent or avoid the technological protection measures included in or relating to the Software.\n(ii) dissemble, decompile, decrypt, illegally penetrate, copy, use or reconstruct the logic of the Software, unless expressly authorized by copyright regulation.\n(iii) separate the Software components to use them on different devices.\n(iv) publish, copy, transfer, rent, sell, export, import, distribute or lend the Software.\n(v) transfer the Software, Software licenses or any other right to access or use the Software.\n(vi) make unauthorized use of the Software in a way that could interfere with the use of the Services by third parties.\nand (vii) attempt to do, or assist anyone in doing or attempting to do, any of the foregoing .</p>\n<p>Blade shall provide the User with a license for any Software components offered under an Open Source license.\nThe terms of this license may expressly prevail over some of these Conditions.</p>\n<p>In addition, there may be specific licenses for downloading and using the Software, which must be accepted to do so.</p>\n<p>Users who wish to access their remote computer from a Third-Party Terminal are asked to check with Blade that there is a Software which can be used to do so.\nBlade plans to continue developing the Software required to access Shadow\u00ae from the largest number of Third-Party Terminals as possible, but cannot guarantee that there is a Software for each of them, or that a Software will remain available for a particular Third-Party Terminal or third party operating system.</p>Peripherals<p>The Shadow\u00ae remote computer may be linked to most standard peripherals (printers, joysticks, etc.) subject to compliance with the terms of use of the operating system installed on the machine.</p>\n<p>However, the User is asked to check with Blade that his or her peripherals are compatible with the Service and/or Terminal and Third-Party Terminals that he or she wishes to use.\nBlade plans to make further IT developments which are necessary to ensure the Service is compatible with as many peripherals as possible, but cannot guarantee that it is compatible with all existing peripherals, and does not guarantee compatibility with any specific peripheral.\nThe User agrees and acknowledges that incompatibility with peripherals does not allow the User to request a cancellation or a refund.\nIn particular, the performance of some peripherals may be affected if the User's Internet connection, for example, his or her bandwidth, is not enough to ensure use under the best possible conditions.</p>\n<p>In this regard, Users are encouraged to report any anomalies observed to Blade, affecting the running of their peripherals, by sending a message to the Blade Support Department, via the User Account.</p>Servers<p>Blade may use any hardware or service providers which it considers appropriate to ensure the functioning of the Services.\nThe hardware and service providers used may, however, change over time.\nIn particular, Blade's aim is to replace the hardware used for the Services regularly, so that the Services continue to be competitive.\nBlade is solely responsible for selecting the hardware and service providers that it uses to provide the Services, at its sole discretion.\nThe User therefore understands and accepts that he or she may not make any complaint or demand with respect to Blade's choice of hardware and service providers, except in cases where a change in the hardware and service providers results in the defective provision of the services subject to these Conditions.</p>\n<p>Blade may offer subscriptions and/or paying options that give access to different configurations, or set up optimized allocation mechanisms for server computing resources depending on use by Users.\nThus, in the event that a User launches programs and applications from Shadow\u00ae that do not require the hardware resources to which they have subscribed, Shadow may use less performant resources, as long as the User's experience is not altered.</p>\n<p>The User further acknowledge and agrees that, to ensure optimal allocation of its IT resources, Shadow\u00ae uses a remote computer automatic shut down and/or standby mechanism.\nIn this respect, given that the User is warned in advance before Shadow\u00ae is shut down or put on standby, Blade shall not be held liable for the resulting loss of data.</p>Storage capacity<p>When they take out a subscription, Users are informed of the initial Blade Cloud storage disk capacity which they are allocated as part of their subscription.\nThis initial capacity composes their main storage disk (the \"Main Disk\").</p>\n<p>Blade may offer Users different subscription options or a paying options system so that they can enjoy a greater hard disk capacity, which can include the addition of additional capacity via one or more additional storage disk(s) (The \"Additional Disk(s)\").</p>Operating System<p>Unless indicated otherwise, the Windows Home operating system (OS) is used for the Shadow\u00ae Service.</p>\n<p>Therefore, by subscribing to the Shadow\u00ae Service, the User expressly authorizes Blade to purchase a Windows licence (\"the Licence\") in his or her name and on his or her behalf.\nThe User will be the sole holder of this Licence throughout the Subscription Period.\nIt is understood that the User shall use the Licence on his or her Shadow\u00ae remote personal computer only, in accordance with the Licence terms of use, and shall return the Licence to Blade for its original price, if the subscription is ended for any reason whatsoever, subject to Microsoft\u2019s terms of use for the Licence.\nThe Licence will be automatically transferred at the time of cancellation, without any other formality being necessary.</p>\n<p>Given that the License is purchased on behalf of the User, Blade will have an interest-free claim on the User, throughout his or her subscription period, equal to the price paid by Blade on behalf of the User for the purchase of the License.\nThis claim will not be due during the subscription period, and will be offset, without any formality being necessary, by the price owed by Blade for the return of the License at the end of the subscription.</p>\n<p>Once the License has been transferred, at the same time the claim is offset, the User will no longer be the License holder, and will have settled the debt to Blade for the purchase of the License when the Service subscription was taken out.</p>\n<p>The User expressly and irrevocably accepts these conditions and the principle of this contractual offsetting, which are an integral part of the Conditions, and without which Blade would not have offered the Services under the same conditions.</p>\n<p>It is understood that, instead of the above arrangement, Blade may provide the User, free of charge, with a License, of which Blade is the holder, for the subscription term, and for exclusive use on the Shadow\u00ae remote computer.</p>\n<p>In any case, by taking out a subscription to Shadow\u00ae, the User shall not acquire any right of use over his or her remote computer operating system continuing after the subscription has been cancelled.</p>Internet Access<p>Access to the Services, from both the Terminal and from Third-Party Terminals, means that the User has a working Internet connection.\nThis connection is not included in the Services offered by Blade and its organization and costs are the User\u2019s responsibility.\nThe quality of the Services also depends on the quality of this connection (for example, in terms of stability, speed, bandwidth, response time, etc.).</p>\n<p>The User is responsible for ensuring the quality of his or her Internet connection before subscribing to the Services.\nIn particular, the User is informed that Shadow\u00ae has been optimized for very high-speed connections (via a fiber optic or coaxial cable connection) when using the Services to play video games.\nADSL or lower quality connections may not enable optimal use and/or performance of the Services.</p>\n<p>Blade cannot be held liable for interruptions or alterations to its Services as a result of interruptions or alterations to the User's Internet access.\nNo compensation will be granted to the User if his or her access to the Services has been interrupted or altered as a result of an Internet access problem.</p>\n<p>The User is also informed that using the Services is likely to result in the transfer of large quantities of data.\nBlade shall not incur the additional costs which the User may be billed for the transfer of these data.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the User is informed and acknowledges that for optimal functioning of the Services, it is strongly recommended to connect the Terminal or Third-Party Terminals to a local Internet service using an Ethernet cable, rather than using WiFi or mobile Internet connections.\nThe use of power-line communications (PLC) devices is not recommended.</p>Access to Services<p>Shadow\u00ae may be accessed via a specific terminal developed by Blade (\"the Terminal\") or via the Software provided by Blade and installed on third-party terminals (\"the Third-Party Terminals\").\nBlade does not guarantee that a Software for a specific third-party operating system will remain available at all time during the Subscription Period.</p>Subscriptions which include the provision of a Terminal<p>In the case of subscriptions which include the provision of a Terminal, Blade shall provide the User with a Terminal for the sole purpose of accessing the Service, and for the duration of the User's subscription period only.\nIt shall remain the unseizable property of Blade.\nIt may not be assigned, sub-leased, transformed, given as a pledge or collateral, transferred or loan in any form whatsoever by the User.\nIt may not be disassembled by the User or used for any purpose other than accessing the Services.\nThe User will be billed for rental of the Terminal in addition to the subscription.</p>\n<p>Photos and pictures of the Terminal on the Websites are provided for illustrative purposes.\nAlthough every effort is made to provide accurate information on our website, Blade may not be held liable and the User shall not be granted any right to cancel his or her Shadow\u00ae subscription, if Blade decides to provide the User with a Terminal that slightly varies from the pictures on the Websites.</p>\n<p>The User is the custodian of the Terminal from the date it is delivered until it is returned to Blade, and is responsible for insuring itself against any damage that may be caused to it or ensuring that its insurance covers this type of good and claim.\nAs custodian, the User is and shall remain liable for any damage to the Terminal by the User or a third-party, even if it is not their fault.\nThe User shall account for any Terminal that is stolen, lost or damaged.\nHe or she shall not dissemble or more generally impair the electric or electronic integrity of the Terminal.\nIf the Terminal is damaged during the subscription period, the User will be liable to pay Blade an indemnity calculated using a scale provided on the Websites, as well as delivery charges.\nFor more information, see Repairs, exchanges and accessories.</p>\n<p>Blade shall replace the Terminal free of charge in the event of a fault that is not attributable to the User, it being understood that any fault caused intentionally or unintentionally by the User (for example, unreasonable use or use that is not in line with Blade's guidelines contained in the instructions provided with the Terminal and/or available on the shadow.tech Website) will be attributable to the User.\nTerminals will be replaced free of charge provided that the User sends back or takes the Terminal to the after-sales service point indicated by Blade on the&nbsp;shadow.tech&nbsp;Website or to the address provided by Blade\u2019s Support Department (or if not indicated on the

modify, adapt, publish, translate, create a derivative work, distribute and display this content worldwide, for a period of ten (10) years.</p>Third-Party Services and Applications<p>The Services may include third-party software, applications, websites and services which are offered, controlled or operated by third-parties unaffiliated with Blade (\"<strong>the Third-Party Applications</strong>\"), or entitle the User to purchase or subscribe to Third-Party Applications.\nThese Third-Party Applications may have their own general conditions of use and confidentiality policies governing their use, which the User may be required to accept in order to access and/or use the relevant Third-Party Applications.\nBlade will under no circumstances be liable for these Third-Party Applications, or goods or services that the User may acquire or subscribe to using his or her remote computer, and disclaim all liability which may arise out of or in connection with, any Third-Party Applications.</p>User's data and content<p>To use the Services, the User is required to send certain files, content, e-mails, contacts, etc.\n(hereinafter \"<strong>the Data</strong>\") to

we cancel, terminate&nbsp.\nor suspend the Services.\nBlade is not liable for deletion of User Data, or accidental loss of User Data.\nWe strongly advise users to back up their Data to other locations.</p>\n<p>Some Services may allow the User to share his or her Data with third parties.\nThe User is solely liable for sharing his or her Data.\nIn this respect, Blade would ask the User to take great care when choosing the Data which he or she chooses to share, and the individuals with which the Data are shared.</p>\n<p>The User is responsible for taking all necessary measures to back up and protect his or her Data, in particular against viruses circulating on the Internet.\nIt is also the responsibility of the User to perform regular backups of his or her data, including the Data, on a medium outside of the Services and by all means at the User\u2019s convenience (for example, with the help of an external storage drive or a storage service in the cloud).</p>\n<p>If the User's subscription is cancelled, the information saved on the Main Disk of his or her remote computer, including his or her Data, will remain available for downloading over a period of fifteen (15) days following the effective date of termination requested.\nAfter this period, Blade may permanently delete the information, including the User's Data, which may no longer be accessed by the User.\nThe User's data contained on the Additional Disk(s), including his or her Data, does not benefit from the grace period and will be deleted on the day the termination takes effect.\nIt is the responsibility of the User to ensure that on the date the termination of the User\u2019s subscription takes effect, he or she has recovered all of his or her data, including his or her Data.</p>Personal data<p>In addition to the Data saved on the User's remote computer, Blade is required to collect certain personal data on the User.</p>\n<p>The processing of the User\u2019s personal data by Blade is indicated in our Privacy Policy on the Websites.\nBy his or her acceptance of these Conditions, the User also adheres to the Privacy Policy in all its provisions.</p>\n<p>The personal data that the User sends to/via his or her Shadow\u00ae remote computer is his or her sole responsibility.\nThe User is the custodian of these data and is solely responsible for the processing of said data.\nThe User alone decides which data he or she sends to his or her remote computer, and what is done with the data once transferred to the computer.\nFor example, the User will be solely liable for transferring personal data to his or her Shadow\u00ae remote computer and using it on third-party websites, software or applications, with the exception of third parties to which the User has communicated the information.\nUnder no circumstances may Blade be held liable, or be deemed responsible for processing such data, or be considered having sent the data outside the European Union.</p>Availability of the Service<p>Blade shall endeavor to ensure continued access to the Services.\nBlade may, however, suspend access to all or part of the Services from time to time, for example, for maintenance purposes or updates, and for any reasons intended to improve the Services provided to the User.</p>\n<p>Except in cases justified on the grounds of urgency or force majeure, Blade shall warn the User of the suspension of the Services, on its Website or by any other appropriate means.</p>\n<p>In case of the total interruption of the Services for more than 24 hours, the User may be refunded by Blade the part of the monthly subscription calculated on a pro rata basis for the period the Services were unavailable, unless the interruption is a result of force majeure, an unforeseeable or unavoidable act of a third party, or the User's fault.\nFurthermore, due to the nature of the Internet, the User acknowledges and accepts that Blade cannot be held liable for any interruptions or alterations to access to the Services that may be caused by the Internet or the means of connection used by User.</p>Websites User Licence<p>Blade grants the User, subject to compliance with these Conditions, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable and revocable license for non-commercial, personal, private access, browsing and use of the Websites.</p>\n<p>Blade grants the User a non-exclusive and revocable right to create hyperlinks to the home page of the Websites, provided that they do not portray Blade or its Services in a misleading, derogatory or offensive way, or more generally, provided that they do not affect Blade in any way whatsoever.</p>\n<p>The reproduction of any documents published on the Websites is only permitted for information purposes, and for personal and private use only.\nAny commercial use of the documents is strictly prohibited.</p>Intellectual Property<p>All intellectual property associated with the Services and the Software (jointly referred to as \"<strong>the Intellectual Property Assets</strong>\") constitute intellectual works protected by the provisions of international intellectual property law, worldwide.</p>\n<p>The Intellectual Property Assets and all their components (such as copyrights, trademarks, service marks, logos, photographs, publications, texts,

illustrations, digital downloads, animated and audio sequences or otherwise, along with all the intellectual works integrated into the Intellectual Property Assets) are the exclusive property of Blade, its affiliates or the third parties having allowed Blade to use them.\nThe components, together or separately, are protected by national and international property law, worldwide.\nThe trademarks on the Intellectual Property Assets may be registered trademarks.</p>\n<p>The User acknowledges that by purchasing the Services, he or she is not acquiring any right in or title to the Intellectual Property Assets.\nExcept as specifically permitted herein, no portion of the Intellectual Property Assets may be used or reproduced in any form, or by any means.\nAll intellectual property rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved to Blade, its affiliates, or the third parties having allowed Blade to use them.</p>Termination and suspension<p>Termination at Blade\u2019s initiative</p>\n<p>Blade reserves the right to automatically suspend the Services, without providing notice, in the event of a breach by the User of his or her legal obligations or these Conditions, and in particular in the event of violation of the&nbsp;Code of Conduct.\nBlade also reserves the right to suspend the Services after sending the User a payment request in the case of late payment.</p>\n<p>Once the Service has been suspended and after formal notice has been sent to the User by e-mail and no response has been received within eight (8) days, Blade is also entitled to cancel the User's subscription by e-mail.</p>\n<p>By exception, in the event of a serious breach by the User of his or her legal obligations or these Conditions, in particular in the case of a serious breach of the Code of Conduct, Blade reserves the right to terminate the Services as of right and without notice.\nThe seriousness of the breach is determined by Blade at its sole discretion, and in particular may arise from the repetition of the breach, the number of breaches, the effect of the breach on the proper functioning of Blade computer hardware or the general functioning of the Services, or even the responsibility borne by Blade due to the User\u2019s breach.</p>\n<p>In the case of termination at the initiative of Blade following late payment, or a breach by the User of his or her legal obligations or these Conditions, and in particular the Code of Conduct, the User will be liable to pay Blade, on the date of cancellation, all the fees owed for the remaining period of the current Subscription Period, if applicable.\nThis amount may be collected by Blade using the same means of payment used to pay the subscription bills, or by any other means.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Termination at the User\u2019s initiative</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The User may end his or her subscription to the Services at any time, by sending a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt, to the address stated for this purpose in the User Account or in the legal notices, or by any other means provided to the User for this purpose, notably in his or her User Account or by a message sent to the Support Department.\nIn this case, the Service and the corresponding payments will continue until the last day of the then-current Subscription Period (for the sake of clarity, where the User has purchased a subscription with commitment, the termination will only be effective at the end of the committed period.\ne.g.\nif a User choose a 12 months commitment, he or she may send a termination notice at any time but will still be required to pay the full amount for the entire duration of the 12 months), and will stop immediately once this period has elapsed, subject to, where applicable, the period offered to the User to download data saved on the Main Disk of his or her remote computer, including his or her Data.\nThe User acknowledges that the termination of his or her subscription will result in the loss of his or her Data.\nThus, unless an imperative statutory provision provides otherwise, Blade will not make any refund due to the termination of the Services.</p>\n<p>To identify and authenticate terminations received, all termination requests must state the User's name(s), surname(s) and user name if applicable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Termination consequences</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event of termination at the initiative of Blade for breach of the Code of Conduct or for late payment, the data saved on all the storage disks of the remote computer (Main Disk and Additional Disk(s) if applicable), including the Data, will be completely deleted without delay.</p>\n<p>Irrespective of the reason for cancellation of the User's subscription to the Service, it is the User's responsibility to return the Terminal, if his or her subscription includes the provision or rental of a Terminal, in accordance with the conditions set out in the section&nbsp;Returning the Terminal.</p>\n<p>The User acknowledges that, once the period offered for the downloading of the data saved on the Main Disk of his or her remote computer, including his or her Data, has expired, the termination of the Service will lead to the irreversible loss of the entirety of the User\u2019s data saved on the Main Disk of his or her remote computer, including his or her Data.\nThe data, including the Data, contained on the Additional Disk(s) does not benefit from an extension of time for the downloading of the data, and will be deleted immediately upon termination.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, unless otherwise indicated at the time of subscription to an option, any termination of the Services will lead to the User losing the benefit of the options he or she had subscribed to in relation with the terminated Services and which will therefore be terminated on the same date as the main subscription.</p>\n<p>To the extent that the User were to take out a subscription to the Services again, even in the case where he or she were to take out the new subscription from the same User Account, he or she would not be able to benefit from the restoration of his or her data, and would have access to a blank machine.\nAlso, the User will not have the right to subscribe to the options which he or she previously had access to if they are not, or are no longer marketed.</p>Provision of Services.\nTerritories<p>The Services are available in the countries or US states mentioned on the Websites only.</p>\n<p>The Shadow\u00ae remote computer may be accessed worldwide, provided the User has access to a Terminal or Third-Party Terminal connected to the Internet.\nHowever, the distance between the User and the Blade data centers, where the servers are located, could affect the quality of the Services, as a result of the additional time required to send the data between the User's terminals and the server.</p>\n<p>If the User lives outside a country or a US state where Shadow\u00ae is officially sold, Blade reserves the right to automatically suspend or cancel the User's subscription.</p>Copyright<p>Blade respects the intellectual property of others and ask its Users to do the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the User believes that any content made available on or through our Services has been used or exploited in a manner

AND EMPLOYEES HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM, COST, LIABILITY, LOSS OR SETTLEMENT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-PARTY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH A VIOLATION BY THE USER OF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS.</p>Force Majeure<p>Blade shall not be held liable for failure to fulfill its obligations in the event of Force Majeure, which is defined as any unforeseeable and unavoidable event that is beyond the Parties' control, in particular, wars, riots, transport and telecommunication network interruptions, social conflicts, natural disasters, laws or regulations imposing restrictions on these Conditions, malicious acts, cases regularly cited by case law, and acts of God, making the normal performance of these Conditions impossible.</p>\n<p>If, following a case of Force Majeure, Blade is required to interrupt its services, the performance of these Conditions will be suspended for the time Blade is unable to fulfill its obligations.</p>Amendment of the Conditions<p>Blade may be required to, or may, in its sole discretion, amend these Conditions from time to time.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If these Conditions are amended in order to reflect (a) legislative changes, (b) regulatory requirements, or (c) material changes made to the Services that do not negatively impact on the User\u2019s rights or the Services to which he or she has subscribed, the amendments made by Blade will take effect on the date indicated on the notice relating to these changes, at the earliest thirty (30) days after said notification, except if such amendments are made to reflect legislative changes or regulatory requirements.\nIn such cases, the modifications may take effect immediately.</p>\n<p>If the amendments to these Conditions are made in order to reflect material changes in the Services impacting negatively on the User\u2019s rights or the Services to which he or she has subscribed, the User will be notified of such changes and may be asked to accept the amended Conditions.\nShould the User refuse the amended Conditions, the User will be free to terminate his or her subscription for a period of thirty (30) days following the notification on these changes, this termination taking effect at the next date the current monthly Subscription Period comes to term.\nIf the User has not terminated his or her subscription in a period of thirty (30) days following the receipt of the notification, the absence of termination will constitute the User\u2019s acknowledgement and acceptance of the amended Conditions, which will take effect on the date indicated on the notification on these changes, and at the earliest thirty (30) days after said notification.</p>\n<p>The User may not modify these Conditions, the Privacy Policy, the Cookies Charter, or any other terms and conditions or policy he or she is subject to, by making any typed, handwritten, or any other changes to it, for any purpose.</p>Communication.\nNotice<p>Unless otherwise stated in these Conditions, the User is asked to contact Blade by sending a message to the Blade Support Department, via the User Account.</p>\n<p>Blade may contact the User by any useful means, and for example, by e-mail or SMS sent to the contact details provided by the User in his or her&nbsp;User Account, by the User's Shadow\u00ae remote computer or by the Websites.</p>Miscellaneous<p>These Conditions constitute the entire agreement between the User and Blade with respect to the subject matter of these Conditions, and supersede and replace any other prior or contemporaneous agreements, or terms and conditions applicable to the subject matter of these Conditions.</p>\n<p>These Conditions create no third-party beneficiary rights.</p>\n<p>Any forbearance, facility or waiver of the terms and conditions set forth in these Conditions, regardless of the frequency and duration, shall in no way be construed as an amendment or deletion of the terms, or granting of a right, as either Party may cancel it at any time.\nIn particular, Blade\u2019s failure to enforce a provision of these Conditions shall not be deemed a waiver of its right to do so in the future.</p>\n<p>If one or more of the provisions of these Conditions is held as invalid or declared void in accordance with a law, regulation or following the final decision of a competent court, this shall not affect the force and scope of the other provisions.</p>\n<p>In any case, the Parties agree to replace the term declared null and void with one that is as close as possible in content to the term initially adopted and the will of the Parties.</p>\n<p>In the event of difference between the interpretation of one of the titles and provisions of the titles that it represents, they will be declared non-existent.</p>\n<p>The User may not assign any of his or her rights under these Conditions, and any such attempt will be void.\nBlade may assign its rights to any of its affiliates, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>Applicable law.\nDisputes<p>These Conditions are governed by California law, except for its conflicts of laws principles, unless otherwise required by a mandatory law of any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Parties shall endeavor to settle any disputes regarding the interpretation or execution of these Conditions amicably before submitting the case to the competent courts.</p>\n<p>To that effect, before filing a claim against Blade, the User agrees to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending a message to the Blade Support Department, via the User Account.&nbsp.\nThe Parties will try to resolve the dispute informally.&nbsp.\nIf a dispute is not resolved within fifteen days of submission, the User or Blade may bring a formal proceeding.</p>\n<p>Any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to these Conditions or the Services shall be brought in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California, subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions below.\nBoth the User and Blade consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts.</p>\n<p>The Conditions have been drawn up in English.\nIf there is a translation, the English version will be deemed valid for contractual purposes.</p>Mandatory Arbitration<p>Blade and the User agree to resolve any claims relating to these Conditions or the Services through final and binding arbitration by a single arbitrator.</p>\n<p>The User can decline this agreement to arbitrate by submitting an opt-out form within 30 days of first registering your account.\nThe opt out form can be obtained at no charge from Blade by sending a message to Blade\u2019s Support Department.\nHowever, if the User agreed to a previous version of these Conditions that him or her to opt out of arbitration, his or her previous choice to opt out or not opt out remains binding.</p>\n<p>The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration will be held in the United States county where the User lives or works, San Francisco (CA), or any other location Blade agrees to.&nbsp.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either the User or Blade may assert claims in small claims court in San Francisco (CA) or any United States county where the User lives or works.&nbsp.\nEither party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, violation of these Conditions, or intellectual property infringement without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.&nbsp.\nIf the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to the User or his or her claim, the User agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California, to resolve the User claim.</p>\n<p>The User may only resolve disputes with Blade on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action.&nbsp.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are NOT allowed.&nbsp.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \"Mandatory Arbitration Provisions\" section will be deemed void.</p>Latest NewsHello, hello?
