policies of Omni Development, Inc.\ndba the Omni Group (collectively \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d or \u201cOmni Group\u201d) regarding the information we collect or receive about our customers.\nIt is applicable to the omnigroup.com website and other interactive features, applications, services, or downloads that are operated by the Omni Group and which are available through the websites produced and maintained by us (\u201cWebsite\u201d).\nWe have established this security and privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) to let you know the kinds of personal information we may gather, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage your personal information.</p>\n<p>Along with the personal information which we gather or which you provide to us (for example, when you sign up for a newsletter or other mailing list, you comment on a blog or forum we operate, you purchase something from us, or we provide customer service to you), this Privacy Policy describes our policy regarding files which you upload to or store on the Omni Sync Server (\u201cCustomer Data\u201d).</p>\n<p>When you provide personal information and/or Customer Data, you are consenting to the manner in which the Omni Group will collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage your personal information and Customer Data, as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website, software, or Omni Sync Server.\nWe reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time without notice.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or don\u2019t see your concerns addressed here, you should contact us by email at info@omnigroup.com.</p> What Information About Me Is Collected and Stored? <p>One of the basic principles we\u2019ve tried to follow in designing this Website is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you\u2019ve requested.\nAs a result, what information we collect and store depends almost entirely on how you choose to make use of our Website and our services.\nIn addition to information which you explicitly and knowingly provide, some information is collected incidentally such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our Website uses browser cookies in order to gather information on usage patterns.</li>\n<li>Our software may, with your permission, send us statistics about its use (see below).</li>\n<li>Our servers maintain industry-standard logs of their activity: web page visits, including IP address, Referer: header, and user-agent.\nenvelope information of e-mail sent and received.\nand the like.</li>\n</ul> How do we use the information we collect? <p>We may use your information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications.\nIn general, we do not use your information beyond the purpose for which you provided it to us.\nFor example, if you ask us a question by email, or subscribe to a mailing list, we will not send you product announcements or other promotional communications in response (unless that is what you requested).\nWe do not sell, barter, or rent your personal information.</p>\n<p>We do use your information internally to understand how people use our Website, services, and software and to make improvements.</p>\n<p>In the event we wish to publicly post any of your personal information on a website (as, for instance, a letter), we will contact you with details and ask for your express permission to publish that information and will not publish without your express permission.</p>\n<p>If you have subscribed to any Omni newsletter you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions located within each newsletter and on our Website, or by contacting us.</p>\n<p>We gather general non-specific statistics about Customer Data that will help us improve the service, such as the amount of storage you are consuming on our servers, user-agent information sent in HTTP headers, or overall usage patterns.\nIn rare cases we may examine metadata such as file names or synchronization client state in order to understand how the service is performing.</p>\n<p>We occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as marketing, analytics, credit card processing, shipping or stocking orders, fraud protection, etc.\nThese entities have access to personal information only to the extent needed to perform their functions.\nThey are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that personal information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>If you provide information to us for the purpose of making it public (for example, on a mailing list, blog, or forum that we operate), we cannot control what other parties may do with that information once it is public.\nPlease be careful about what you disclose and do not post any information that you expect to keep private.</p>\n<p>We may provide aggregate, anonymous statistical information derived from information we collect to other organizations or to the public (for example, see http://update.omnigroup.com/).\nAny information we share in this manner will not identify you personally.</p>\n<p>We may also use or disclose personal information or Customer Data if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Website.\n(b) to protect and defend our rights or property, the Website or our users, or (c) under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, the users of the Website, or the public.\nIn cases where we must disclose personal information or Customer Data, we will send email to the address registered to any accounts affected by that disclosure.</p> How long do we retain the information we collect? <p>Most information we collect may be stored indefinitely.</p>\n<p>If you provide your credit card information, we do of course transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing using commercially reasonable encryption methods.\nIn addition, we will store the expiration date and last four digits of the credit card number in case you contact us with a billing question or we need to apply a refund or credit.\nWe do not store the full credit card number or the card security code you enter in the payment form.</p>\n<p>We maintain backups of Customer Data in order to recover from hardware failures or other problems.\nThese backups are not kept longer than six months.</p> What Steps Are Taken To Keep Personal Information and Customer Data Protected? <p>We are committed to protecting your personal information and Customer Data.\nWe use a variety of technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information and Customer Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</p>\n<p>Personal information we collect or receive and Customer Data you upload is stored in protected operating environments that are not available to the public and, when transmitted, is protected using strong cryptography.\nOur public-facing servers are periodically reviewed for known security issues by a third party.</p>\n<p>We limit access to your personal information or Customer Data to only our employees and third parties who need access for purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nThey are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that personal information, are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose, and are subject to disciplinary action, including possible termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution, for failing to do so.</p>\n<p>If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information and Customer Data, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.\nDo not share this information with anyone.\nIf you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a website or service to protect access to your personal information and Customer Data from subsequent users.</p>\n<p>While we use reasonable security measures to safeguard your personal information and Customer Data once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nYou should know that no company, including the Omni Group, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information or Customer Data.\nAccordingly, the Omni Group cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us on our Sites.</p> Information for Users in Europe and Elsewhere Outside the U.S.\n<p>If you use our Website outside of the United States, you understand that we may collect, process, and store your

Well, to be perfectly honest, our lawyers have told us that we need to protect ourselves.\nWe at the Omni Group pride ourselves on our low-key style, but the global nature of the software business means that one lawsuit from one user in a far-flung jurisdiction could seriously affect us and our ability to provide software.\nIt also means that, without this license agreement, we might not have protection from people who misuse our software.\nWe do not want to risk our entire company on such possibilities, however unlikely, because we like doing what we do and want to continue to be able to do it.\nAnd, so, we require you to read and agree to the terms of this document before using our software.\nWe think you will find it quite reasonable.\nObviously, if you disagree, click \u201cDisagree.\u201d But, don\u2019t just stop there.\nLet us know.\nSend some email to info@omnigroup.com telling us what you find unacceptable about our license agreement.\nWe can\u2019t promise to change anything, but we will do our best to get back to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>THIS END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (\u201dLicense Agreement\u201d) IS A LEGAL

Agreement, do not click on the \u201cAgree\u201d button and you may not access or otherwise use or benefit from the Software in any manner.\nThe terms and conditions of this License Agreement also

multiple machines.\nHowever, a single license does not allow multiple users to ever use Software on multiple machines, regardless of whether such use is concurrent, except in the case of Family Pack licensing.</p>\n<p>Family Pack licenses permit you to install and use the software on up to five computers at a time as long as those computers are located in the same household (portables which are used primarily in this household are included) and used by persons who occupy that same household.\nBy \u201chousehold\u201d we mean a person or persons sharing the same single family housing unit such as a home, apartment, mobile home or condominium.\nThis license does not extend to students who reside at a separate on-campus location or to business or commercial users.</p>\n<p>(b) Online

for the subscription period for which you have paid the applicable subscription fees, solely for your own internal business purposes, subject to the terms of this License Agreement and any other terms and conditions accompanying such Software.\nIf any subscription based Software is licensed on a \u201cnamed user\u201d basis, rights of any user licensed to utilize the Software service cannot be shared or used by more than one individual.\nIn addition, a user may not be transferred from one individual to another unless the original user no longer requires, and is no longer permitted, access to the Software service.\nYou may have the option to extend your subscription or convert to a perpetual license.\nIf you extend your subscription, you may continue using the Software until the end of your extended subscription period.\nSee the Software activation screens or other accompanying materials for subscription details.\nAfter the expiration of your subscription, features of the Software

multiple users (including employees, agents, or contractors) will use those machines unless you purchase a corresponding number of seat licenses.\nYour possession, installation, or use of the Software does not transfer to you any title to the intellectual property in the Software, and you will not acquire any rights to the Software except as expressly set forth in this License Agreement.\nTo the

Registration Key to any third party.</p>\n<p>(b) You may modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.\nHowever, you may not do so for the purpose of disabling the feature of the Software that provides intermittent reminders that you have not registered your copy of the Software (i.e.\ncircumventing the Registration Key system), creating derivative works, or for the purpose of circumventing any of the terms of this License Agreement or any other provision of law.</p>\n<p>(c) You may not claim that the Software, in whole or in part, is yours, and you may not use the name the Omni Group or Omni Development (or any of their suppliers\u2019) or any of their respective logos or trademarks in any manner without first obtaining the prior written permission from an authorized representative of the Omni Group.</p>\n<p>(d) You must use the Software at all times in a manner that is consistent with any other software licenses granted to you by other companies that have

license agreement between you and Apple, Inc.</p>\n<p>(e) You may not distribute copies of the Software, in whole or in part, to any third party, nor may you use, rent, make available, loan, sublicense, or lease, with or without consideration, the Software to third parties.\nYou further may not use the Software to act as a service bureau or application service provider or use the Software
