a fee.\nWe will confirm to you in writing or verbally if and when we have accepted your order for termination.\nSee clause 15, and the Sections of these terms and conditions that apply to the <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> you wish to terminate, for details of the process and any costs and charges that apply.\nApart from that, you may not terminate the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em> or any part of it except by giving us written notice after a <em>\n<strong>material breach by us</strong>\n</em> has occurred, or as permitted (if at all) by the Section of these terms and conditions that applies to the<em>\n<strong> transaction</strong>\n</em>or <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please Note:</strong> If you wish to terminate due to a <em>\n<strong>material breach by us</strong>\n</em>, for the termination to be valid you must show us evidence of the breach if we ask (and if it is reasonable in all the circumstances for us to ask).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Termination of contract by us</strong> Before we terminate the contract we will always consider whether any <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em> or<strong>\n<em> problem</em>\n</strong> could be remedied.\nIf it can, we will try to contact you and work with you to try and remedy the breach.\nHowever, when a <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>problem</strong>\n</em> in our view cannot be remedied, or it is not remedied within reasonable time after we try to contact you about it, or as a result of uncontrollable factors as set out in clause 20, we reserve the right to terminate.\nIn this case we may terminate the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or a particular <em>\n<strong>transaction</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> by giving you written notice, or as permitted (if at all) by a Section that applies.\nWe can also terminate (or treat as being terminated) the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or a particular <em>\n<strong>transaction</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, if we are released from our obligations under the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em> or in relation to the particular <em>\n<strong>transaction</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Changes to your details</strong> If you are an <em>\n<strong>a</strong>\n</em>\n<em>\n<strong>ccount user</strong>\n</em> and there is any change to the details that we required you to provide for us to set you up as an <em>\n<strong>account user</strong>\n</em>, you must notify us of the changes immediately.\nThe same applies if you lose your account card that we issue to account users.\nAfter notifying us you will have to deliver to us the account card (or written confirmation that you have lost it) and any further <em>\n<strong>ID</strong>\n</em> as requested, at your cost.\nIf you do not do so we may exercise any of our \u201cSuspension, refusal, blocking\u201d rights, as at clause 16 below, and may be entitled to terminate pending transactions or <strong>\n<em>services</em>\n</strong>or the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may at our absolute discretion treat it as a <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em> or<em>\n<strong> problem</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>If you are not an <em>\n<strong>account user</strong>\n</em> and there is any difference between the details we hold for you from an earlier or completed order or offer and the details you supply for a new <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> or<em>\n<strong> offer</strong>\n</em>, we may require you to provide full and fresh <em>\n<strong>ID</strong>\n</em> for us to verify in full as part of the <em>\n<strong>preconditions</strong>\n</em> of the new<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*15.\nCONSEQUENCES OF TERMINATION OR REMEDIES</strong> If you or we terminate the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or any part of it, either by valid notice or mutual agreement, all of the following consequences will apply to the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or the part of it that is terminated:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will be liable for any adverse movement in the underlying metal price based on the difference in the global market spot price from when your <strong>\n<em>order</em>\n</strong>was placed and when the termination is accepted by us, multiplied by the precious metal content of your <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>.</li>\n<li>A termination fee will be incurred.</li>\n<li>You may have to provide <em>\n<strong>payment</strong>\n</em> for additional services such as delivery of <em>\n<strong>goods</strong>\n</em> to you.</li>\n<li>All sums payable to us in respect of the period up to and including the date of termination will fall immediately due and payable.\nThis includes sums referred to in paragraph (1) immediately above, and fees and charges for any <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em> or<em>\n<strong> problem</strong>\n</em>.\nYou must pay those sums to us immediately.</li>\n<li>Our obligations under or in connection with the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>will cease to apply, and we will no longer meet those obligations.\nThis includes any obligation to complete <em>\n<strong>transactions</strong>\n</em> and/or to provide <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> which are terminated.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We do not breach the <strong>\n<em>contract</em>\n</strong> or any other obligation to you, or become liable to you, purely by virtue of terminating the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or any part of it (provided we do so validly), and the same applies if you terminate validly.\nWe also do not breach the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or any obligation to you, or become liable to you, by virtue of exercising our remedies (provided we do so properly).</p>\n<p>Termination or exercise of our remedies will not affect your or our accrued rights and remedies.\nProvisions in these terms and conditions which expressly or by implication have effect after termination will continue in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nOUR REMEDIES</strong> We will act reasonably and proportionally when exercising our remedies.\nWe may exercise the remedies set out below.\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Reliance on your order</strong> We are entitled to rely on your <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> as being complete and accurate.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that the<em>\n<strong> order</strong>\n</em>is complete and accurate.\nWhilst we will carry out <em>\n<strong>ID</strong>\n</em> verification and check that your <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> contains the information we need, we read your <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>for our own purposes and may not pick up errors or omissions.\nYou cannot rely on us to detect your errors or omissions.\nIf we have to deal with errors or omissions it may be a default or problem.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Special fees and charges</strong> If there is a<em>\n<strong> default</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>problem</strong>\n</em> we may charge you fees and charges in accordance with our<em>\n<strong> tariff</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Additional information</strong> You must provide additional information if we ask for it and our request is reasonable.\nIf you fail to provide such information when asked it will constitute a<em>\n<strong> material breach by you</strong>\n</em>.\nIt will always be reasonable for us to ask for information relating to the <em>\n<strong>preconditions</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Your death or incapacity</strong> If you die or cease to have mental capacity your personal representatives (following your death) or Deputy of the Court of Protection (in the event of your incapacity) must inform us as soon as possible of their appointment by submitting an <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> for our trustee <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Voluntary trusts</strong> This applies if we provide our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> for you.<em>\n<strong> Your goods</strong>\n</em> stored by us may be held on trust.\nYou may hold them on trust for someone else, or you may choose to place them in trust where someone else is the trustee.\nIn either case you must inform us by submitting an <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> for our trustee <strong>\n<em>service</em>\n</strong>.\nWe will keep a record of the trust arrangement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Trustee service</strong> To use our trustee <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, Clause 4 will apply.\nWe will treat your verified personal representative(s), Deputy or trustee(s) as being you for the purposes of the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Suspension, refusal, blocking</strong> We have the following rights under the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em> if there is a <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>problem</strong>\n</em> or a <em>\n<strong>material breach by you</strong>\n</em>, or if any <em>\n<strong>insolvency</strong>\n</em>on your part occurs, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect any of the foregoing.\nWe may choose to exercise these rights in addition to any right of termination we may have, or as an alternative.\nWe will tell you that we are exercising our rights, and we may do this by email, phone or by formal written notice.\nOur rights are that we may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>suspend processing of all or any part of your <em>\n<strong>orders</strong>\n</em>, <em>\n<strong>offers</strong>\n</em>, or<em>\n<strong> transactions</strong>\n</em>.\nand/or</li>\n<li>suspend and/or stop you using all or any of the facilities which are available to you by virtue of you being an <em>\n<strong>account user</strong>\n</em>.\nand/or</li>\n<li>suspend and/or stop provision of all or any <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em>.\nand/or</li>\n<li>refuse to receive <em>\n<strong>orders</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>offers</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>payments</strong>\n</em> from you, and/or to provide or operate <em>\n<strong>user accounts</strong>\n</em> and/or associated direct debits for you.\nand/or</li>\n<li>cancel your <em>\n<strong>user accounts</strong>\n</em> and/or your status as an<strong>\n<em>account user</em>\n</strong>, and/or associated direct debits.\nand/or</li>\n<li>block your access to our website and/or helpline facilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>*Insolvency in relation to you</strong> If any<em>\n<strong> insolvency</strong>\n</em> on your part occurs before you become the legal owner of the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> (or we have reasonable grounds to believe such<em>\n<strong> insolvency</strong>\n</em> is about to happen) then, without limiting any of our other rights or remedies under the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or at law: (1) we will not be obliged to complete any storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> or any collection or delivery<em>\n<strong> service</strong>\n</em> that you have requested, and (2) we may take the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> back and you must give them back immediately if we ask, and (3) if necessary we may enter any premises which you own or control, to get the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>.\nIf we take the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> back we will either not process the payment from you, or will reimburse it to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Indemnity against tax</strong> You must indemnify us on request against all or any direct or indirect taxes, duties, levies or similar payable by you in any jurisdiction in relation to any <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>, including for supply of<em>\n<strong> goods</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em>.\nThis means that if we are asked to make any such payment for you, you must reimburse us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Our right to withhold your property</strong> We can hold on to any<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> that belong to you or that you <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>, if you owe us any payment or other sum.\nIf you ask us for our collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> we will not be obliged to provide any of those <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> until you have paid the outstanding sums as well as the price for the<strong>\n<em> order</em>\n</strong> for the <em>\n<strong>service(s)</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Set off</strong> We may at any time set off any sum of money you owe to us against any sum of money that we owe to you, whether or not either liability arises under the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.\nIf we exercise this right validly, it will constitute a <em>\n<strong>default or problem</strong>\n</em>and you will have to pay our <strong>\n<em>tariff</em>\n</strong>.\nWe may only exercise this right if we have asked you in writing for <em>\n<strong>payment</strong>\n</em> at least 5 <em>\n<strong>working days</strong>\n</em> previously and we have not received it.\nAny exercise of our right of set off will not limit or affect any other rights or remedies we have under the <strong>\n<em>contract</em>\n</strong> or at law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Set off against item(s)</strong> We have this right if we provide our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>for you.\nIf we are entitled to exercise our right of set off, above, and we owe you no money or less than the amount you owe to us, we may exercise our right of set off against <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>.\nThis means we will deduct from <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em>that we store for you or which we hold ready for collection or delivery some <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> up to the value of the money you owe us.\nWe are unable to cut <em>\n<strong>your goods,</strong>\n</em> so if fractions are left over after we have exercised this right we will pay you the value of the fractions left over.</p>\n<p>We will exercise this right based on the value of your <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>which we exercise the right against, as at the time when we exercise this right.</p>\n<p>If we exercise this right validly, it will constitute a <strong>default or problem</strong> and you will have to pay our <strong>tariff</strong>.\nAny exercise of our right of set off will not limit or affect any other rights or remedies we have under the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or at law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Excessive outstanding charges and tariff</strong> We have this right if we provide our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> for you.\nIf we do not receive <em>\n<strong>payment</strong>\n</em>for our <strong>\n<em>charges</em>\n</strong>and/or the <em>\n<strong>tariff</strong>\n</em>, and the total of the outstanding sums ever exceeds the value of the<em>\n<strong> goods</strong>\n</em> we hold for you as part of our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, we may cancel your <em>\n<strong>user account</strong>\n</em> and your status as an <em>\n<strong>account user</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>If we exercise this right validly, it will constitute a <strong>\n<em>default</em>\n</strong>or<em>\n<strong> problem</strong>\n</em> and you will have to pay our <strong>\n<em>tariff</em>\n</strong>.\nAny exercise of our right of set off will not limit or affect any other rights or remedies we have under the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or at law.\nFor example, in these circumstances we are likely to exercise our rights of set off, above.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Exclusion of certain statutory rights</strong> The terms implied into contracts by Sections 13 to 15 (inclusive) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and by Sections 3 to 5 (inclusive) of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 are, to the fullest extent permitted by law, excluded from the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Unclaimed funds</strong> If we are unable to contact you at any time we will try several times, over a reasonable period of time.\nWe may also carry out searches to find alternative ways of contacting you, although we will try to avoid doing this as it will constitute a <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em>or <em>\n<strong>problem</strong>\n</em>.\nIf we are still unable to contact you within a reasonable period of time we may cash in your<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> and, after settling our fees, charges and costs, pay the remaining sums to a charity of our choice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nVAT</strong> We will charge and collect from you, and you must pay, United Kingdom VAT at the rate applicable to the <em>\n<strong>goods</strong>\n</em> and <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> under the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em>.\nWe will account to HM Revenue and Customs in relation to VAT collected by us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\nDATA PROTECTION</strong> By submitting an <strong>\n<em>order</em>\n</strong> or <em>\n<strong>offer</strong>\n</em>to us you give us your explicit consent allowing us to use your personal data as described in the <em>\n<strong>privacy statement</strong>\n</em>.\nWe use your personal information as a data controller.\nThe <em>\n<strong>privacy statement</strong>\n</em> is subject to change.\nThe latest version is always available on our website.\nYour consent applies to the privacy statement as it stands at the date and time when you provide personal data and when we use it.</p>\n<p>You agree that we may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti fraud checks.\nPersonal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.\nYou can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be unaffected.</p>\n<p>Your email address is essential in order for us to be able to supply you with important information such as order confirmations and changes to the service, By registering with us you accept that your email address may be used to supply you with such information.</p>\n<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time.\nThis will constitute a <em>\n<strong>default</strong>\n</em> or<em>\n<strong> problem</strong>\n</em> because it will make it difficult or impossible for us to perform the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or do anything else with or for you, and it may <strong>constitute a material breach by you.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.\nGUARANTEE AND COMPENSATION SCHEMES</strong> No guarantee funds or other compensation arrangements apply in relation to any of our<em>\n<strong> goods</strong>\n</em> or<em>\n<strong> services</strong>\n</em> or to any <em>\n<strong>payment</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>transaction</strong>\n</em> , except for the direct debit guarantee which we will confirm to you separately if you become an <em>\n<strong>account user.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.\nGENERAL</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Entire agreement</strong> The <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>offer</strong>\n</em> as accepted by us, and these terms and conditions, and documents referred to in these terms and

or in connection with the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> which results from an event or occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control.\nIn such circumstances we may choose to terminate the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em> or the affected part(s) of it at any time by giving you written notice.</p>\n<p>We are not obliged to buy <em>\n<strong>metal</strong>\n</em> from you.\nThis

2<em>\n<strong> working days</strong>\n</em> of the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> being formed, but we may take as long as we consider reasonable in the circumstances.\nThis will be if there are uncontrollable factors, such as any <em>\n<strong>insolvency,</strong>\n</em> if for any reason there is exceptional demand for any of our <em>\n<strong>goods</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em>, or we are unable to purchase sufficient goods from our suppliers to fulfil orders.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Authenticity</strong> When you buy<em>\n<strong>

provision (or part of it) will be deemed deleted.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Waiver</strong> A waiver of any right or remedy under the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> or law is only effective if it is in writing.\nAny waiver is specific to the time and circumstances in which it is given, and will not set a precedent or reasonable expectation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third parties</strong> A person who is not a party to the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> shall not have any rights to enforce its terms or conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Variation</strong> Except as set out in these terms and

collection <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, and some via our delivery<em>\n<strong> service</strong>\n</em>, you must complete a separate <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> for each<em>\n<strong> service</strong>\n</em> request.</p>\n<p>*<strong>Part of your holding</strong> If part or all of the <em>\n<strong>items(s)</strong>\n</em> is/are held in <em>\n<strong>storage</strong>\n</em> with us the<em>\n<strong> order</strong>\n</em> must specify precisely which <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> you would like to receive.\nIf the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> is not specific, we will choose for you and you must accept our selection.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Price</strong> The price of your <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> will include our <em>\n<strong>charges</strong>\n</em> for providing the <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.<br>In the case of stored <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> if you want to receive part of your holding we will have to extract all of your <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> under the <em>\n<strong>order,</strong>\n</em> set aside the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> that you require for collection or delivery, then re-vault the remainder of the <em>\n<strong>items(s)</strong>\n</em> which you do not want to receive.\nYou may incur<em>\n<strong> charges</strong>\n</em> for re-vaulting as well as for collection or delivery.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our obligations</strong> Subject as marked \u2018*\u2019 above in this clause 26 and Section A and the <em>\n<strong>preconditions</strong>\n</em> and to our rights and remedies under these terms and conditions, we must provide the<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> stated in the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> via the collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> stated in the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>.\nNormally we will make the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> available within 5 <em>\n<strong>working days</strong>\n</em> of your <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>, and this is what we will aim to do subject to clause 20, above (see \u201cUncontrollable factors\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>27.\nDELIVERY TO YOU (OR TO US, FOR COLLECTION)</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Place and time of delivery</strong> The <em>\n<strong>goods</strong>\n</em> will be delivered by our carrier to the delivery address as stated in the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>.\nThe liability for any loss is yours where delivery is subject to a postal redirection or to a PO Box or mail box address, or a house of multiple occupation.</p>\n<p>We cannot be held responsible for delays in delivery or collection as a result of stock shortages, due to adverse weather, traffic delays, mechanical breakdowns or other circumstances beyond our control.\nAny dates quoted for delivery are approximate only and the time of delivery will not be of the essence of the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please Note:</strong> All <em>\n<strong>orders</strong>\n</em>will be deemed delivered when signed for by any person at the delivery address or confirmed as delivered by our couriers.\nYou must satisfy yourself before requesting any delivery that this will be secure as any loss incurred after the delivery is signed for at the address or confirmed as delivered by our couriers will be your liability.\nThis may particularly be a risk for you if you live in a house of multiple occupation or you choose delivery to a work address.</p>\n<p>You should not accept or sign for any delivery where the package has been damaged, resealed or tampered with and instruct the courier to return the item to us.\nWe cannot accept any liability for loss once a package has been accepted by any person at the delivery address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Delivery in instalments</strong> We may deliver the<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> by instalments.\nThis means that the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> will be delivered in two or more separate packages.\nIf we do this, each package will constitute a separate <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>, under a separate <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.\nIf there is any delay or other problem with delivery of one package you will have rights and remedies under these terms and conditions in relation to that package, not the other packages.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Investigation of non-delivery</strong> We are entitled but not obliged to investigate cases of<em>\n<strong> non-delivery.</strong>\n</em> We will consider investigating particularly if we suspect fraud.\nWe may commission others, including investigators and professional advisers, to assist with any investigation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Fraud</strong> If you (either alone or with others) are found to have acted fraudulently in relation to <em>\n<strong>non-delivery</strong>\n</em>, we will have no obligation to attempt fresh delivery of replacement <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>.\nThis will apply if you are found to have acted fraudulently by (1) any court or tribunal finding or decision, or (2) reasonable grounds for a suspicion established by any investigation by us or any law enforcer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Indemnity against loss</strong> You must indemnify us on request against all and any of our costs (including time spent by our staff) and expenses reasonably incurred in exercising our right to investigate <em>\n<strong>non-delivery</strong>\n</em>reported by you.\nThis means that if we ask, you must reimburse us.\nThis indemnity will be disapplied if you or our investigation into <em>\n<strong>non-delivery</strong>\n</em>can demonstrate there was no fraud, and that there are no reasonable grounds to suspect a fraud.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Your obligation to accept delivery</strong> If no one accepts delivery at the delivery address the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> will be returned to us if not collected from the local sorting office.\nNormally we will try to contact you and attempt to re-deliver them.\nWe do not normally treat this as a <em>\n<strong>default or problem</strong>\n</em>unless (for example) it happens repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if we are unable to arrange re-delivery, or if re-delivery fails, it will be a <em>\n<strong>default or problem</strong>\n</em>, and at our discretion we may either (1) sell the<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> and reimburse you for the sale price of the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>after deducting our fees, charges and costs, or (2) move the<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> to storage with one of our subcontractors which will incur our storage and delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>+Exclusion of our liability if you delay or fail to take delivery</strong> We will not be liable to you for any delay in delivery of<em>\n<strong> goods</strong>\n</em> to you or for any <em>\n<strong>non-delivery</strong>\n</em>, if it is caused by: (1) you being unavailable, (2) your instructions (or lack of instructions) relevant for delivery, or (3) by a person or factor that is outside the control of us or our carrier (e.g.\ntraffic or emergency) or that is within your control.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>+Liability for delivery factors outside your control</strong> Failed delivery is deemed to be always in your reasonable control unless it is demonstrably caused by us or our carrier and not at all by you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Limitation of our liability for our failure to deliver</strong> Subject as marked \u2018+\u2019 above, and to these terms and conditions, if a case of failed delivery is demonstrably caused by us or our carrier and not at all by you or a person or factor that is within your control, our liability shall be limited as follows (whichever applies):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we or our carrier still hold the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>: to the cost (if any) of re-delivery.</li>\n<li>If we or our carrier do not hold the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>: to the price (as stated in the accepted <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>) of the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>contained in the package that was not delivered, and the cost of our delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>for that package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will be liable for failed delivery of a package containing the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> if there is no fraud or error on your part and, for example, we confirm the package was never sent, or our carrier confirms that the package was lost by the carrier, or stolen from it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please Note:</strong> It will be at our discretion as to whether we meet liability for our failure to deliver by replacing the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> or refunding to you the original price stated in the accepted <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Delivery tracking</strong> Please read clause 18, above.\nOur Privacy Statement applies when you use our delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Completion</strong> Our delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> is complete when we have completed our delivery obligations under these terms and conditions, or when we have been released from those obligations in accordance with these terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>28.\nCOLLECTION SERVICE</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Price for collection</strong> Where <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> are stored, the price of the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> may include<em>\n<strong> charges</strong>\n</em> for extraction if you choose to collect <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> which we hold in storage for you

are unable to arrange collection again, or if you do not collect within 5 <em>\n<strong>working days</strong>\n</em> of us telling you the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> are ready, at our discretion we may either sell the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> and reimburse you for the sale price of the<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> after deducting our fees, charges and costs, or move the <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>to storage with one of our subcontractors.\nWe will also incur further delivery costs and expenses, and/or storage costs and expenses, and will charge

must be met.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Minimum period of storage</strong> There is no minimum period of storage, but we calculate our charges for our storage

place<em>\n<strong> your goods</strong>\n</em> into storage immediately after you have bought them from us.\nIf you want us to except goods which are in your possession,&nbsp;we will decide at our discretion whether to provide our storage<em>\n<strong> service</strong>\n</em>.\nIf we agree to provide our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em>will be stored on an \u201cas-is\u201d or \u201csaid-to-contain\u201d basis and we will not be responsible for the authenticity of the<em>\n<strong> item(s)</strong>\n</em> stored, which means you may not

resolve it.\nNon-<em>\n<strong>payment</strong>\n</em> is a <em>\n<strong>material breach by you</strong>\n</em>and ultimately our rights in Section A clause 14 and clause 16 will apply.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Our liability for storage service</strong>&nbsp;We are responsible for arranging for storage of <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> with our subcontractors.</p>\n<p>We are responsible for ensuring that, under our contracts with the subcontractors, our subcontractors bear the risk of loss, damage or theft of <strong>\n<em>your goods</em>\n</strong> from the start of our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> until it is complete, and that they maintain appropriate insurance against the risks.</p>\n<p>If any of the <em>\n<strong>goods</strong>\n</em> held by our subcontractors under the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em> are lost, damaged or stolen, we will work with you to enforce our rights and remedies against our subcontractor and their insurer(s) on your behalf.</p>\n<p>For any accepted claims we will endeavour to work with our subcontractor to replace your<em>\n<strong> item</strong>(</em>s) with like for like or equivalent <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em> agreed by you, but reserve the right to arrange for our subcontractor or its insurer to reimburse you in the form of cash reimbursement (Sterling).</p>\n<p>The maximum liability of our subcontractor in respect of our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> shall not exceed the then current value of <strong>\n<em>your goods</em>\n</strong> that were lost, damaged or stolen.\nThis is the maximum liability that our subcontractor and its insurer will accept under our contract with the subcontractor and is based on the market value at the 3rd business day following notification of any loss as expressed in USD ($) and converted to Sterling based on the exchange rate on that day.\nOur entire liability in respect of our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> shall not exceed the cap stated in clause 10, above.</p>\n<p>This limitation of liability applies only whilst <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> are inside the premises where they are stored.\nWhen they are outside those premises they are subject to our collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>and Section C, above, applies to our liability.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Taxation</strong> You acknowledge we will not be held liable for any taxes, duties or levies generated as a result of you entering into a <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> with us either now or in the future.\nIt is a condition of the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em> that if you need tax advice either now or in the future you must rely on your own tax/accounting adviser.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your right to remove your goods from storage</strong> You can request delivery or collection of<em>\n<strong> your goods</strong>\n</em>from storage at any time after the <em>\n<strong>commencement date</strong>\n</em>.\nThis is subject to the following.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To use our storage termination <em>\n<strong>service,</strong>\n</em> clause 4, above, applies.\nThe <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em> requesting this <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> must specify which <em>\n<strong>item(s)</strong>\n</em>you wish to bring out of storage, and which of our collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> you require.</li>\n<li>Before we will provide the storage termination <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>the <em>\n<strong>preconditions</strong>\n</em> must be met.</li>\n<li>The price of our storage termination <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> may include our <em>\n<strong>charges</strong>\n</em> for providing our storage termination <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> and will include our <em>\n<strong>charges</strong>\n</em> for providing our collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> (as stated in the <em>\n<strong>order</strong>\n</em>).</li>\n<li>The termination of the storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> will not take effect immediately, because it will take us time to provide the <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> that we must perform as a consequence of termination.\nTermination will take effect when our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> is complete.</li>\n<li>You must pay any taxes due prior to delivery which we will collect on your behalf and account for to HMRC.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>*Cancellation of direct debit</strong> If you cancel your direct debit instruction to us or if we are for any reason unable to obtain payment via your direct debit instruction we will try to contact you and arrange alternative payment.\nIf we are unable to resolve the situation with you it will constitute a<strong>\n</strong>\n<em>\n<strong>material breach by you</strong>\n</em>, and may also constitute a <em>\n<strong>default or problem</strong>\n</em>.\nIn any such case we may ultimately terminate the storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> we provide for you, or treat it as being terminated, and we may be entitled to terminate the<em>\n<strong> contract</strong>\n</em>.\nWherever possible we will try to contact you and give notice before we take such steps.\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Our right to terminate storage services</strong> As set out in Section A, we will work with you to try and find a solution when a <em>\n<strong>default or problem</strong>\n</em>occurs.\nIn cases which cannot be fixed, or if the attempted solution does not work, we reserve the right to exercise our rights under Section A in relation to our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.\nWe may be entitled to suspend our use of your <em>\n<strong>payment account</strong>\n</em> or <em>\n<strong>user account</strong>\n</em>, or to cancel your <em>\n<strong>user account</strong>\n</em>or direct debit.\nWe may also be entitled to terminate the storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> or even to terminate the <em>\n<strong>contract</strong>\n</em>.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to terminate the storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> at any time on providing you with 90 days notice.\nIf you do not arrange for delivery or collection of <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> or to sell them then we have the right to sell <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> at the then current market price and will send any proceeds less our relevant charges to your <em>\n<strong>payment account.</strong>\n</em>\n<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please Note:</strong> In some circumstances we will be released from our obligation to provide part(s) of our storage termination <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, particularly under Section A in relation to total loss reimbursement, or Section C in relation to our collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Consequences of termination</strong> As a consequence of termination you will incur our charges for providing our storage termination <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.\nUnless you tell us in writing we will automatically provide our delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>, using our most secure available delivery <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> to you at the delivery address verified or given as part of the <em>\n<strong>ID</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our obligations</strong> Subject as marked \u2018*\u2019 above in this Section D, Section A, the <em>\n<strong>preconditions</strong>\n</em> and to our rights and remedies under these terms and conditions, we will arrange for <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em>&nbsp;to be stored in storage facilities provided by our subcontractors.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Changes in our service or facilities</strong> If<em>\n<strong> your goods</strong>\n</em> are stored with us for a long time the exact features of our <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> or facilities may change.\nFor example, we may change the subcontractor that we use to help us provide the facilities and some of the <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em>, and the new subcontractor might do things differently from the old one.\nWe may also choose to change the <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> or facilities for our business purposes, or to introduce new or improved features.</p>\n<p>We will never reduce the level of security that is afforded to the storage of <em>\n<strong>your goods</strong>\n</em> without notifying you before the changes come into effect, and giving you the opportunity to terminate the storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> if you do not like the changes.</p>\n<p>We may however make any other changes without your consent or approval.\nWe consider this is reasonable because if there is no impact on the level of security provided, there is no impact on the essence of our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.<br>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>*Changes by you</strong> We choose the locations and subcontractors for our storage<em>\n<strong> service</strong>\n</em>.\nYou have no right to change the location of the vault where <em>\n<strong>goods</strong>\n</em> we hold for you are stored unless we offer this as a <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em>.\nYou can move <em>\n<strong>g</strong>\n</em>\n<em>\n<strong>oods</strong>\n</em>only using our collection or delivery <em>\n<strong>services</strong>\n</em> under Section C, above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Completion</strong> Our storage <em>\n<strong>service</strong>\n</em> is complete when we have completed collection or delivery obligations as part of our storage termination service, or when we have been released from those obligations in accordance with these terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section
