NoticeTerms Of Use<strong>Cookie Notice</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Last updated: 01/01/2020</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Cookie Notice explains how A&amp;E Television Networks, LLC and its affiliates collectively \u201c<strong>A+E Networks</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d)&nbsp.\nuse cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our U.S.-based digital properties, such as websites, mobile apps, smart TV apps, games or other interactive features, or installed software (each a \u201c<strong>Site</strong>\u201d).\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat are cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you visit a Site Cookies are widely used by Site owners in order to make their Sites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>\n<p>There are several types of cookies:</p>\n<p>Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that particular browser session.</p>\n<p>Persistent cookies are stored on your device, and they remain there when you close your web browser.\nThe cookies can be read by the Site that created them when you visit that Site again.</p>\n<p>First-party cookies are set by the Site owner, in this case, A+E Networks<sup>\u00ae</sup>.</p>\n<p>Third-party cookies are set by parties other than the Site owner.\nThird-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Site (e.g., advertising, interactive content and analytics).\nThe parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the Site in question and also when it visits certain other Sites.</p>\n<p>Cookies can be disabled or removed by tools that are available in most commercial browsers.\nThe preference for each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nWhy do we use cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Sites to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies.\nOther cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Sites.\nThird parties serve cookies through our Sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.</p>\n<p>The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Site you visit):</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nStrictly Necessary Cookies: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies are strictly necessary in order to enable you to move around our Sites, provide you with services available through our Sites and to use some of their features, such as access to secure areas.\nAs these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Sites to you, if this category of cookie is disabled, certain functionality [(like navigating our Sites)] may become unavailable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nPerformance and Functionality Cookies: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Sites but are nonessential to their use.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality [(like videos)] may become unavailable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics and customization cookies: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Sites are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Sites for you.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality [(like analytics and customization)] may become unavailable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising cookies: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.\nThey perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social networking cookies</strong>:</p>\n<p>These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Sites through third party social networking and other websites.&nbsp.\nThese cookies may also be used for advertising purposes.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality [(like sharing pages and content through third-party social networking and other websites)] may become unavailable.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nWhat about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a Site.\nWe may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \u201ctracking pixels\u201d or \u201cclear gifs\u201d).\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened an email that we have sent them.\nThis allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.\nIn many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>\n<p>In the United States, we use Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Cooperative to better understand how you use certain websites and apps across the various devices you use.\nVisit the Adobe website to learn more about how Adobe does this and how you may opt-out of this program.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nDo you serve targeted advertising?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Sites.\nThese companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to personalize content, and provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.\nThey may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.\nThis can be accomplished by their using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Sites and third party.\nThe information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nHow can I control cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.</p>\n<p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies or set your browser to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the website you visit.\nIf you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.\nAs the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser.</p>\n<p>The various browsers provide different procedures to manage your settings.</p>\n<p>Click on any of the browser links for instructions.</p>\n<p>MICROSOFT WINDOWS

PRIVACY</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not anticipate that our Websites or Digital Media will be used by individuals under 16 years of age (each a \"Minor\"), nor that we will collect and use personal information about Minors.\n&nbsp;If you are a Minor, please get your parent or your legal guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to us.</p>\n<p>If we become aware that a Minor has provided us with personal information without the permission of their parent or legal guardian, we will remove this information from our systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>8.\nDATA RETENTION</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>9.\nINTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.\nThese countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p>\n<p>Specifically, our Website servers are located in the US, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.\n&nbsp;This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>\n<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nThese include implementing an intra-group agreement incorporating the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request.\nWe have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>10.\nYOUR LEGAL/DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</u>\n</strong>\n<br>You have the following data protection rights:</p>\n<p>\u2022 If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided at the top of this Privacy Policy.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2022 In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information.\nAgain, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\u2022 You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.\n&nbsp;You can exercise this right by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d or \u201copt-out\u201d link in the marketing e-mails we send you.\n&nbsp;To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.\n&nbsp;Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>\n<p>\u2022 You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.\n&nbsp;For more information, in the UK please contact the Information Commissioner's Office: at:&nbsp;https://ico.org.uk/global/contact-us/.&nbsp.\nfor data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries please check here:

laws.</p>\n<p>The date at the top of this Privacy Policy indicates when it was last updated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current.\nPlease
