construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that these Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Resolution of Any Dispute.</strong> In the event a dispute arises between you and TIME (\u201cDispute\u201d), we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute.\nMost customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by contacting us by writing to TIME USA LLC, TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States..\nIf, however, the Dispute cannot be resolved by the personnel directly involved, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute promptly by negotiation between duly appointed executive officers or other representatives of such parties, with full authority to negotiate and settle the Dispute.\nIf a Dispute has not been resolved by negotiations within 90 days as provided hereinabove, such Dispute shall be submitted to JAMS, or its successor (collectively, \u201cJAMS\u201d), for mediation as provided hereinbelow.\nAny party involved in the Dispute may commence mediation by providing to JAMS and each other party involved in the Dispute a written request for mediation, setting forth the subject of the Dispute and the relief requested.\nThe parties will cooperate with JAMS and with one another in selecting a mediator from JAMS\u2019 panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings.\nThe parties covenant that they will participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in its costs.\nAll offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys, and by the mediator and any JAMS employees, are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties.\nprovided, however, that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.\nNone of the parties may commence arbitration or a civil action with respect to the matters submitted to mediation until after the completion of the initial mediation session, or 30 business days after the date of filing the written request for mediation, whichever occurs first.\nMediation may continue after the commencement of arbitration or a civil action, if the parties so desire.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitation of Legal Remedies</strong>.\nIf there is a Dispute that remains unresolved after mediation, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND TIME EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO TIME\u2019S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND STATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (\u201cClaim(s)\u201d).\nThe arbitrator's decision and award are final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Jury Trial Waiver</strong>.\nYOU AND TIME EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SITES OR SERVICES.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>.\nYOU AND TIME EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nAll arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief.\nYou acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class, representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person (\"Class Action Waiver\").</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought (\"Notice\").\nAll Notices to TIME must be sent to the following address: TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States..\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section.\nUpon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60-day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties.\nAfter the expiration of such 60-day cure period, you or TIME may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nUnless otherwise agreed to by you and TIME in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the Dispute.\nThis Section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nYou and TIME agree that this Section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA.\nThe arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York, and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person or by telephone.\nEach party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.\nThe JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com.\nTo the extent that this dispute resolution Section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control.\nNeither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nand any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable.\nHowever, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exception to Arbitration</strong>\n<em>.\n</em>&nbsp;Only disputes or actions pertaining to TIME\u2019s intellectual property rights, or statutory claims that pursuant to law are not arbitrable, are exempt from arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Survival.</strong> This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Section is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong> DISPUTE RESOLUTION NON-U.S.\nRESIDENTS</strong>\n</li>\n<p>In the event of any dispute you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us but if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this section.\nYour notice to us must be sent to us at timeforeigndispute@time.com or to TIME USA LLC, 1095 Sixth Avenue, New York, NY 10036, United States.\nFor a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, TIME and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, though nothing will require either you or TIME to resolve the dispute on terms either you or TIME, in each of our sole discretion, are unsatisfactory.\nNothing in this section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in court or another complaint process.</p>\n<p>If your country of residence or establishment is outside the U.S., these Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with English law.\nThe application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.\nThis choice of law does not impact your rights as a consumer according to the consumer protection laws of your country of residence.\nIf you are a consumer, you may be able to bring judicial proceedings against us arising from or in connection with these Terms in a court within a jurisdiction according to the laws of your country of residence or the English courts.\nif you are acting as a business, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.</p>\n<p>If you have any

policies incorporated herein, are the entire agreement between you and TIME.\nThey supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and TIME relating to your use of the Sites or Services.\nIf these Terms expire or are terminated for any reason, the provisions which by their nature should continue after termination including Proprietary Rights, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Your Legal Liability, Arbitration/Dispute Resolution For U.S.\nResidents, Dispute Resolution Non-U.S.\nResidents, No Rights of Third Parties, and Miscellaneous shall survive any such expiration or termination.\nIf any provision of these Terms is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.\nYou may not assign your rights under your TIME Account or this agreement to any third party without TIME\u2019 prior written permission.\nTIME may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time.\nHeadings in the Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this agreement.\nThe failure of TIME to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of TIME to enforce any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by TIME or be deemed a waiver by TIME of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms.\nThe rights and remedies of TIME under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and TIME shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit TIME\u2019 right to exercise any other right or remedy.\nIn the event of any conflict or inconsistency between any of these Terms any other terms or conditions applicable to the Services, we shall determine which rules, restrictions, limitations, terms and/or conditions shall control and prevail in our sole discretion, and you specifically waive any right to challenge or dispute such determination.</p>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong> CONTACT
