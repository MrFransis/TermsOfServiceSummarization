&amp.\npermissions</b>\n<ul>\n<li>How do I make my own board?</li>\n<li>How do staff, users and permissions work?</li>\n</ul>What is an imageboard?<p>An imageboard is a type of discussion board where users share images and text about various topics.\n</p>\n<p>The primary difference between imageboards and traditional forums is that anybody can make a post without registering an account or providing any personal information.\nThis lowers the barrier to entry, protects user identities and focuses on what is said, rather than who says it.\n</p>How do I solve CAPTCHA?<p>Select the boxes that correspond to each solid/filled icon in the grid.\nThe image is shuffled and distorted, so use your brain.</p>Name formatting<p>When posting, you can format the name field to include a name, tripcode , capcode, any combination of the three including leaving the field completely blank.\nInstead of a blank name, \"Anonymous\" is used, however this depends on board-specific configuration.\nThe optional components are explained below.</p>\n<b>Format</b>\n<p> Names should be input like: .\nTripcode and capcode are optional components.\nTripcodes and capcodes may not contain \"##\" and the whitespace before capcodes is significant.</p>\n<p>Valid examples: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Name##tripcode</li>\n<li>Name## capcode</li>\n<li>Name##tripcode## capcode</li>\n<li>##tripcode## capcode</li>\n<li>##tripcode</li>\n<li>## capcode</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The capcode can also be left blank to display just your role.</p>\n<p>From the examples, you can see that all components can be used in combination or independently.\nIn a post number 4 would look like:</p> Name !!X8NXmAS44= ##Board Owner capcode 8/2/2019, 5:48:44 AM No.123 HideFilter NameFilter TripcodeModerateHello, world!<p>\n</p>\n<p>The name appears bold in the top left, followed by the tripcode in regular weight with a !! prefix, then the capcode in a different color, bold and with a ## prefix.\nThe colours may vary between themes but are generally distinct from eachother</p>\n<b>Name</b>\n<p>The name is simply what name you want to be shown alongside your post.\nOther users can post with the same name so there is nothing preventing impersonation.\nThis is not related to your username (for registered users).</p>\n<b>Tripcode</b>\n<p>A tripcode is a password of sorts, which users can provide in the tripcode component of their name.\nThis tripcode is used in conjunction with a server-known secret to generate a unique* tripcode portion of the name.\nLong, unique tripcodes can be used as a form of identity.\nIt is important that you keep tripcodes secret if you use them for some form of identity.\nA compromised tripcode can be used for impersonation and cannot be revoked in any way.</p>\n<b>Capcode</b>\n<p>A capcode is a component of the name field only available to authenticated users.\nThis includes admins, global staff, board owners and board moderators.\nIf there is no text after the ##, the role will be displayed alone.\nLeaving a space and putting custom text will be prefixed by the role name.\nThis way, the role is always shown to prevent role impersonation.</p>Post stylingInputOutput&gt;greentext&gt;greentext&lt;pinktext&lt;pinktext==title==title'''bold'''bold__underline__underline~~strikethrough~~strikethrough**spoiler text**spoiler

blockThe \"language\" of code blocks is optional.\nWithout it, automatic language detection is used.\nIf the language is \"plain\", highlighting is disabled for the code block.\nNot all languages are supported, a subset of popular languages is used.\nIf the language is not in the supported list, the code block will be rendered like \"plain\" with no highlighting.\nLanguages supported: javascript, typescript, perl, js, c++, c, java, kotlin, php, h, csharp, bash, sh, zsh, python, ruby, css, html, json, golang, rust, aaWhat is the file size limit?<p>Max size of form data per-post is 32MB.\nBecause other fields e.g.\nname, message, etc contribute to this, the maximum size of file uploads will be very slightly smaller than this.</p>How does moderation work?<b>General</b>\n<p>Moderation is very simple.\nModeration permissions are different between regular users, board staff (board owner or moderator) and globals (global staff or admin).\nBy default, regular users can delete, spoiler or remove the files from their own posts, provided a matching post password is supplied.\nThey can also report or global report posts.\nBoard staff have near full power over posts on their board including removing posts, stickying, spoilering, etc.\neven for other users posts without the need for a password.\nThey also have access to board specific management page.\nGlobal staff have full power over all posts on all boards, can access the board specific management page for any board and additionally have access to the global management page.\nMore details on the specifics of permission levels is available here.</p>\n<b>Local vs.\nGlobal reports</b>\n<p>There exists the concept of \"local\" and \"global\" reports.\nReporting a post locally will show the post along with reports on the report page for that particular board, and the reports may be actioned upon by the board staff.\nReporting a post globally will show the post along with reports on the global manage page available only to global staff and may be actioned upon by global staff.\nGlobal reports should be used to flag posts that violate global rules such as illegal content or spam, in contrast to local reports which are for posts that abide by global rules but break board-specific rules (which may be made arbitrarily by board staff).\nIt is also possible to be banned from a board or globally for abuse of the report system.</p>\n<b>Batch processing of posts</b>\n<p>Each post has a checkbox in the top left to select it for moderation actions.\nMultiple posts may be selected to allow batch processing e.g.\nreporting multiple offending posts in one request.\nThe same is present in moderation interfaces.\nSome actions for example bans (which are based on IP) may also be handled in batches.\nSelecting multiple posts and using the ban action will apply a single ban for each unique IP of the selected posts.</p>\n<b>Time format in moderation interfaces</b>\n<p>Some moderation interfaces, for example the ban duration when moderating posts, or the ban duration for post filtering use a shorthand for times/length.\nThis format supports years, months, weeks, days and hours.\nAn input of \"3m\" would mean 3 months and \"1y2m3w4d5h\" would mean 1 year, 2 months, 3 weeks, 4 days and 5 hours.\nUnits of time should be in descending order, so \"2w1m\" is invalid.\nHowever you may use \"6w\" for example to input 6 weeks, and are not required to use \"1m2w\".</p>How do I make my own board?<p>Register an account, then create a board.\nPlease avoid making excessive amounts of boards, duplicate or boards similar to an existing one unless you expect that many users will migrate to the new board for whatever reason e.g.\ntyrannical moderation.</p>How do staff, users and permissions work?<p>There are 5 levels of permissions on the site with 0 being the highest level of privilege and 4 the lowest.\nIn this list \"Regular user\" refers to somebody who is either not logged in or is not owner/mod of the board.\nFor example if a user creates their own board, they do not have the \"Board owner\" permissions on other boards.\nEach board can have one owner and multiple moderators.\nOwnership can be transferred.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Admin: All permissions</li>\n<li>Global staff: All permissions on all boards excluding account management and news updates</li>\n<li>Board owner: Permissions to board-specific settings, reports, banners and bans and some post actions</li>\n<li>Board moderator: Permissions to manage board-specific reports, bans and some post actions</li>\n<li>Regular user: Permissions to report/delete/spoiler posts</li>\n</ol>Post actions refers to reporting, deleting, stickying, etc.\nMore details on these permissions:<ol>\n<li>Admin: All actions</li>\n<li>Global staff: All below, delete files, delete-by-ip-global and global ban</li>\n<li>Board owner: Same as board moderator</li>\n<li>Board moderator: All below, move/merge, ban, delete-by-ip, sticky/sage/lock/cycle</li>\n<li>Regular user: Reports, and post spoiler/delete/unlink if the board has them enabled</li>\n</ol>Administrators have the ability to assign a permission level directly to users through the global management page.\nTypically a user is level 4 (regular user), 1 (global staff) or 0 (administrator).\nLevel 2 and 3 are usually only aplicable to users when on a board they are owner or moderator.\nHowever, level 2 or 3 can be assigned manually to create global board owners or global board moderators\nwho have board owner or moderation permissions on all boards, but without access to the global moderation interfaces.\nIf assigning global boad owners (level 2), they will have access to the board settings\nand the ability to reassign board owners.<p>\n</p>How can I contact the administration?<p>You can find me on Keybase as \"sturgeonfish\".\nAll emails should be directed to sturgeonfish@protonmail.com.\nFor
