California law and jurisdiction.\n11.1.\nIf you are resident in the European Union and elsewhere in the world (but'not'the USA):\nYou and we agree that your use of the Facepunch Services, and this Agreement, and any issues arising out of them, will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of England and any dispute regarding it will be exclusively under the jurisdiction of the courts of England.\nIn any legal claim under this Agreement, the side which wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses.\nThis does not exclude any mandatorily applicable rules or remedies which would be available to you in a legal claim brought under the law of your EU Member State of residence.\n11.2.\nIf you are resident in the USA:\nTo the extent not covered by the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration language below, you and we agree that your use of the Facepunch Services, and this Agreement, and any issues arising out of them, will be deemed to be entered into in San Francisco, California and governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA (and, if applicable, US Federal law) without regard to choice of law principles.\nAny legal claim by you against Facepunch, to the extent not covered by the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration language below, will be made exclusively in state or federal court located in San Francisco, California, which will have subject matter jurisdiction regarding the dispute between you and us and therefore we both consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.\nMoreover, you waive any rights to argue that the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California are an improper venue.\nIn any legal claim under this Agreement, the side who wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses.\n12.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION SUMMARY.\nIf you have any concerns or issues you can contact us at legal@facepunch.com.\nWe hope we can resolve any complaints with you through informal dispute resolution.\nIf we can't resolve a dispute with you informally, if you are in the EU you can bring formal proceedings against us and if you are in the US, in most cases you can commence arbitration through the American Arbitration Association.\n12.1.\nInformal dispute resolution:\nWe and you both agree to make reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve any dispute between us informally - you can contact us at legal@facepunch.com.\nNormally we would suggest that this dispute resolution period lasts 30 days unless exceptional circumstances exist.\nIf it is not resolved during this time, the next steps depend on where you live.\nIf you are resident in the European Union, you may be entitled to submit a complaint through the Online Dispute Resolution Platform operated by the European Commission, details of which can be found at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.\nIMPORTANT: IF YOU LIVE IN THE USA, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAREFULLY AS IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES BETWEEN US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n12.2.\nDispute resolution next steps: if you live in the European Union or elsewhere in the world (but not the USA):\nYou and we have the legal right to commence legal claims against each other if we consider it necessary.\nIf you bring a claim against Facepunch, you should address it to legal@facepunch.com.\n12.3.\nDispute resolution next steps: if you live in the USA: (a) Agreement to Arbitrate:\nWe and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us on an individual basis through binding arbitration, including without limitation any claims arising from or relating to this Agreement, any part of the relationship between you and us, or your use of the Facepunch Services, except as set forth under 'Exceptions to Informal Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate' below.\nThe US Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law applies to this agreement.\n\"Arbitration\" is a consensual dispute resolution process where both sides present their case to a neutral arbitrator rather than a judge or jury.\nArbitration is less formal than court litigation and review of an arbitrator's decision by a court is limited.\nTo be clear: by choosing arbitration you and we give up the right to have any dispute between us heard in court before a judge and/or jury.\nIndividual Arbitration Only: You and we agree that arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class, consolidated or representative arbitration.\n(b) How to start an arbitration:\nEither of us can commence arbitration by filing an arbitration demand with the AAA that describes the claim and desired remedy.\nNotice sent to Facepunch should be sent by mail and by email.\nYou or Facepunch may bring an arbitration at the American Arbitration Association ('AAA') located in San Francisco, California.\n(c) The rules for the arbitration:\nThe arbitration will be governed by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where applicable, its Consumer Arbitration Rules (available at http://www.adr.org), as modified by this Agreement.\nThe arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted in English by a single arbitrator with substantial experience in intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, selected pursuant to AAA rules.\nThe arbitration hearing may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person, and must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by you and Facepunch.\nJudgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as appropriate.\nIf you seek US $10,000 or less, Facepunch will reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs (but not your attorney's fees or expert witness fees), at the end of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator decides your claims are without merit or your costs are unreasonable.\nFacepunch will only seek its legal fees and costs if it prevails and the arbitrator determines your claims are meritless.\nIf you seek more than US $10,000, then the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Facepunch per the applicable AAA rules.\n12.4.\nExceptions to Informal Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate\nThe dispute resolution and arbitration requirements do not apply to claims or disputes that relate to claims of intellectual property rights infringement or claims of unauthorised use, piracy, theft or misappropriation.\n12.5.\nLimitation on Claims\nYou and Facepunch agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Facepunch Services must be made within one (1) year after the claim arose.\notherwise, such claim is permanently barred.\nYou agree that these dispute resolution and binding arbitration provisions will survive any termination of your account or the Facepunch Services.\nSUMMARY.\nIf you live in the USA or the rest of the world (but not the EU), you and we agree not to bring any class action or similar collective legal action against each other.\nWe will resolve legal disputes with each other through the process outlined above.\n12.6.\nWaiver of class action and collective action remedies:\nTo the maximum extent permitted by the national or state law applicable, you and we agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration in relation to the Facepunch Services or this Agreement.\nThat means, to the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other.\n(2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-wide basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\nIf the previous paragraph is found illegal or unenforceable for any reason, you and Facepunch agree that any class, representative private attorney general action claim or dispute will be resolved in court.\n13.\nOTHER LEGAL MATTERS SUMMARY.\nThis section sets out a few additional, hopefully self-explanatory rules about how this Agreement works legally.\nFor example, this Agreement is just between you and us, we might be required to comply with law enforcement requests etc.\ni.\nIf any part of this Agreement is found not to be legally enforceable, this will not affect any other part of it.\nii.\nThis Agreement does not create any rights for anyone else.\niii.\nPlease remember that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements, including import/export controls.\niv.\nYou and we agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Facepunch Services or this Agreement.\nv.\nWe can assign, subcontract or transfer this Agreement to a third party or another member of our group if necessary for the support of the Facepunch Services, as part of any reorganisation or merger or for other business reasons.\nWe will notify you if this happens.\nvi.\nNo failure or delay by us or you to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law will constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor will it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.\nNo single or partial exercise of such right or remedy by us or you will preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.\nand\nvii.\nThis Agreement does not create any exclusive relationship between us nor any partnership, joint venture, employment or agency.\nPrivacy Policy Facepunch Privacy Policy\nLast updated on 28 August 2019 A quick summary: this document explains:\na) what information we and our

Mods are modifications of a game (or part of it) and/or new content or tools made for it by the community, whether standalone or integrated into our Games, which can range from small additions to complete overhauls ('Mods').\nFor example, Mods include creating a plugin which provides players with additional in-game options, a base-building tool or a new game mode for one of our Games.\nIt's not an exact definition but we think it works and if you're not sure you can always ask us.\n2.\nCan I make Mods for Facepunch Games? Yes (subject to these guidelines).\n3.\nWho owns the Mods? You own Mods that you create.\nHowever, we need you to provide us with specific rights over Mods to help us distribute them and other people to play them via our Games.\nThe legalese is that you give us a non-exclusive, permanent, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-free licence to use, modify, reproduce, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform communicate and exploit your Mods in connection with our Games.\nTo be clear, we still own our Games, our other property and everything in them (e.g.\ngame name, setting, gameplay and appearance).\nIf you plan to put any third-party property into your Mod, it's your sole responsibility to make sure you do it appropriately and legally.\n4.\nCan I sell a Mod I own? Yes.\n5.\nWhat else applies to Mods? (a) Don't call it 'official'.\nIt should be clear that your Mod is unofficial - this can be on your website or on the download page of your Mod or in a txt file in the Mod if applicable.\n(b) It's your responsibility.\nYour Mod is your responsibility.\nFacepunch has no liability for anything that happens with your Mod.\nIt is your job to make sure your Mods comply with Facepunch's legal terms (including these guidelines) and to deal with any third parties using your Mod in ways which you do not like or breach Facepunch's legal terms.\nYou are responsible for everything else to do with the Mod, not us (stuff like legal compliance, payments, refunds, problems etc).\n(c) Don't put it in other games/products.\nPlease do not put your Mod made using our Games into a third-party game or product (whether or not for commercial use) if it contains or uses Facepunch intellectual property or contents.\n(d) Don't be a dick.\nBe respectful to other players and our Games and don't do or say anything that is illegal, circumvents or could harm our Games, Facepunch or any other players.\nDon't infringe the rights of other people or businesses (e.g.\ngames, movies, books, TV shows etc.).\nCheating, griefing or hacking our Games are strictly prohibited - please see the Facepunch Terms of Service (www.facepunch.com/legal/tos) for more information.\n(e) Age appropriate.\nMake sure your Mods are suitable for the Games' target audience.\n(f) Only distribute your Mod.\nYou can distribute your Mod but you can't distribute the underlying Game or other Facepunch property ' that's for us to do.\n(g) Game updates may affect your Mods.\nPlease remember we might make upgrades, updates or patches available from time to time for our Games and that could have an impact on Mods and other software (in the worst case making them inoperable).\n(h) Mods are at our discretion.\nYour ability to create, use and distribute Mods based on our Games is at our discretion and we can withdraw it in the future if we think it is necessary, particularly for the protection of Facepunch or our Games.\nDon't worry, we don't plan to use this arbitrarily or randomly, there has to be sufficient reason, but it's just common sense to point it out.\n(i) Follow the legal rules.\nIn addition to these guidelines there are our full legal rules in the Facepunch Terms of Service and Facepunch Privacy Policy at www.facepunch.com/legal.\nIf there is any conflict between these guidelines and those documents, then those documents win.\nPlease also make sure you comply with any other applicable laws and regulations.\n6.\nChanges to these guidelines.\nWe expect these guidelines to be updated from time to time' we will post an update on wwww.facepunch.com when that happens.\nOnce we change these guidelines, it will become legally binding as soon as it's posted online but you're welcome to contact us anytime at legal@facepunch.com if you have specific questions or concerns about the changes.\nIf you do not agree to those changes, then unfortunately you must stop using our services.\n7.\nAnything else?

Anything you like (within reason and if it follows these guidelines).\nHere are some examples:\n- Making YouTube videos or streams (more on this below).\n- Drawing fanart involving locations from our games and posting this online (e.g.\non your own blog or somewhere else).\n- Creating a community website, fan page or news group.\n- Taking screenshots and share them with friends, or turning them into wallpaper.\nIf you want to make mods with our Games, then check out our Facepunch Modding Guidelines instead at www.facepunch.com/legal/modding.\nWHO OWNS THE FAN CONTENT YOU CREATE BASED ON OUR GAMES? You do (as between you and us), but we need you to give us certain rights over it so that we can actually transmit it and people can use it together with our Games.\nSo, our legal team asks that you give us a non-exclusive, permanent, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable, royalty-free licence to use, modify, reproduce, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform communicate and exploit your Fan Content in connection with our Games.\nJust to be clear, we always own the Games themselves and its contents (such as setting, gameplay and appearance).\nPlease also remember about the Golden Rules described below.\nCAN I MAKE VIDEOS/LET'S PLAYS/STREAMS FOR FACEPUNCH'S GAMES? Yes, do as much as you like as long as they comply with these guidelines.\nThere is an important condition however: monetising via standard revenue on video/streaming/online platforms (including e.g.\nYouTube/Twitch advertising revenue, or digital content, or subscriptions) is OK, but we are not OK with you monetising it in other ways without our written approval ' this includes using our Games to promote someone else's products or services or on TV or films.\nFor video content at tournaments/events, please see below.\nCAN I HAVE TOURNAMENTS, EVENTS OR LAN PARTIES FOR FACEPUNCH'S GAMES? Yup.\nTournaments/events/LAN parties that are for amateurs, not ran to make money and do not have a big prize pool are OK.\nThe same goes for any videos/streams of them too.\nIf you would like to run a public commercial tournament or some other event for our Games that does not follow our Golden Rules below, it's probably still fine but get in touch with us first (legal@facepunch.com).\nWHAT ABOUT SELLING PHYSICAL STUFF? We're OK with that in general terms but it's an area we're thinking about for the future so we reserve the right to issue new rules in the future.\nOur general thinking is the same as everywhere else - we don't want to get in the way where it doesn't make sense, but what everyone wants is stuff that does something new and adds value to the community (which we're not already providing) and follows the basic rules.\nTHE GOLDEN RULES: So everyone is clear, here's some rules we ask everyone to follow: 1.\nDon't call it 'official'.\nYour Fan Content should be clear that it's unofficial.\nPlease do not do or say anything which makes anyone think we endorse or support you.\nThe Fan Content you make based on our Games is solely your responsibility.\n2.\nDon't put it in other games/products.\nYour Fan Content based on our Games should stand on its own ' it should not be incorporated into a third-party game or product (whether or not for commercial use).\n3.\nDon't be a dick.\nPlease be respectful to other players and our Games.\nDo not do or say anything regarding us or our Games that is illegal or could harm our Games, Facepunch or any other players (e.g.\ncontent about cheating in our Games).\nYour Fan Content can use our Games of course, but please do not infringe the rights of other people or businesses (such as other games, movies, books, TV shows etc.).\nCheating, griefing or hacking our Games are strictly prohibited - please see the Facepunch Terms of Service (www.facepunch.com/legal/tos) for more information.\n4.\nAge appropriate.\nMake sure your Fan Content is suitable for the Games' target audience.\n5.\nFollow the legal rules.\nThese guidelines are our informal guidance to you, but the full legal rules are the Facepunch Terms of Service and Facepunch Privacy Policy at www.facepunch.com/legal.\nIf there is any conflict between these guidelines and those documents, then those documents win.\nYour ability to create, use and distribute Fan Content based on our Games is at our discretion and we can withdraw it in the future if we think it is necessary, particularly for the protection of Facepunch or our Games.\nDon't worry, we don't plan to use this arbitrarily or randomly, there has to be sufficient reason, but it's just common sense to point it out.\nCHANGES TO THESE GUIDELINES We expect these guidelines to be updated from time to time as people make new Fan Content based on our Games ' we will post an update online when that happens.\nOnce we change these guidelines, it will become legally binding as soon as it's posted online but you're welcome to contact us at legal@facepunch.com anytime if you have specific questions or concerns about the changes.\nIf you do not agree to those changes, then unfortunately you must stop using our services.\nANYTHING ELSE?

Virtual Goods do not expire, but we reserve the right to change or amend that if necessary.\nAlso, Facepunch reserves the right to revoke from users (without notice or compensation) any Virtual Goods that have been obtained by way of (e.g.) bug, hack or exploitation of the Facepunch Services.\nWe reserve the right to manage, regulate, control, discontinue, vary, modify and/or remove Virtual Goods at our sole discretion without liability to you or anyone if we consider any of this necessary for the ongoing operation or protection of the Facepunch Services or for other legitimate reasons.\nWe will try to give you reasonable advance notice of any such changes.\n7.5.\nCan you refund purchases of the Facepunch Services and/or Virtual Goods? Your refund rights will depend on the terms of any applicable device/platform via which you access the Facepunch Services on, in relation to Facepunch itself: If you are resident in the European Union:\nYou have the right to withdraw from a purchase of the Facepunch Services and/or Virtual Goods within 14 days of your purchase, without giving a reason.\nYou hereby expressly acknowledge that you lose your right of withdrawal once the performance of our service has begun and your account is provided with access to the relevant Facepunch Services and/or Virtual Goods.\nYou agree that the supply of Facepunch Services and/or Virtual Goods and the performance of services begins immediately after you complete your purchase.\nTherefore, once access to the Facepunch Services and/or Virtual Goods has been enabled on your account, the contract has been fully performed by us.\nIf you are resident elsewhere in the world outside the European Union (including the USA):\nAll purchases are final and no refunds will be made or returns accepted.\n8.\nFEEDBACK OR SUGGESTIONS SUMMARY.\nFeedback and suggestions are great (thank you!) but at our discretion without responsibility/liability.\nWe always welcome and appreciate feedback and suggestions (you can send these to legal@facepunch.com) but we may choose not to use or accept them at our discretion.\nIn any event the feedback/suggestions will be received by us without any obligations or liability to you.\n9.\nLIABILITY SUMMARY.\nHere we explain a bit further how we are legally responsible to each other.\nWe ask for certain legal protections from you (legally, this does not apply to EU users).\n9.1.\nLimitation of liability The following section does not apply to you if you are resident in the European Union or countries whose laws specifically prohibit the following liability limitations, but it does apply to you if you are resident in the USA.\n(I) OUR DISCLAIMERS.\nTHE FACEPUNCH SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY UPDATES) ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\", 'AS AVAILABLE' BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.\nWE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE FACEPUNCH SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE GAME WILL BE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.\nFACEPUNCH, ITS AFFILIATES, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR HARM OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE OR 'LOSS' RELATING TO THE FACEPUNCH SERVICES.\n(II) OUR LIABILITY CAP.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE FACEPUNCH SERVICES OR THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID US (IF ANY) IN CONNECTION WITH THE MATTERS UNDERLYING ANY CLAIM(S).\n(III) YOUR INDEMNITY TO US.\nYOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS ON DEMAND FACEPUNCH, ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND PARTNERS FROM ALL LIABILITIES, CLAIMS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES, IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ALLEGED OR ACTUAL BREACH BY YOU OF THIS AGREEMENT.\nIF CLAIMS ARE BROUGHT AGAINST US, THEN YOU WILL COOPERATE FULLY WITH US AND WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO TAKE OVER THEIR DEFENCE.\nYOU WILL NOT SETTLE ANY SUCH CLAIMS WITHOUT OUR PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT.\n(IV) INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.\nYOU AGREE THAT ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR HARM YOU SUFFER ARE NOT IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT, AND OTHER REMEDIES WILL BE ADEQUATE, SUCH THAT YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF AGAINST US.\n(V) Residents of California.\nIf you reside in the state of California you are entitled to the following specific consumer rights information: you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 400 R St., Suite 1080, Sacramento, California, 95814, or by telephone at 916.445.1254.\nCalifornia residents expressly agree to waive California Civil Code Sec.\n1542, which states: 'A general release does not extend the claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.' 10.\nTERMINATION SUMMARY.\nYou can terminate this Agreement by stopping use of all Facepunch Services.\nWe may cancel or suspend (temporarily or permanently) your access to any and/or all of the Facepunch Services if you seriously breach this Agreement.\n10.1.\nWhen and how can you terminate this Agreement?

LAW SUMMARY.\nAny legal questions / complaints / claims regarding this Agreement are under English law and jurisdiction for users all around the world except users resident in the USA, who are under California law and jurisdiction.\n11.1.\nIf you are resident in the European Union and elsewhere in the world (but'not'the USA):\nYou and we agree that your use of the Facepunch Services, and this Agreement, and any issues arising out of them, will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of England and any dispute regarding it will be exclusively under the jurisdiction of the courts of England.\nIn any legal claim under this Agreement, the side which wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses.\nThis does not exclude any mandatorily applicable rules or remedies which would be available to you in a legal claim brought under the law of your EU Member State of residence.\n11.2.\nIf you are resident in the USA:\nTo the extent not covered by the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration language below, you and we agree that your use of the Facepunch Services, and this Agreement, and any issues arising out of them, will be deemed to be entered into in San Francisco, California and governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA (and, if applicable, US Federal law) without regard to choice of law principles.\nAny legal claim by you against Facepunch, to the extent not covered by the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration language below, will be made exclusively in state or federal court located in San Francisco, California, which will have subject matter jurisdiction regarding the dispute between you and us and therefore we both consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts.\nMoreover, you waive any rights to argue that the state and federal courts in San Francisco, California are an improper venue.\nIn any legal claim under this Agreement, the side who wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses.\n12.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION SUMMARY.\nIf you have any concerns or issues you can contact us at legal@facepunch.com.\nWe hope we can resolve any complaints with you through informal dispute resolution.\nIf we can't resolve a dispute with you informally, if you are in the EU you can bring formal proceedings against us and if you are in the US, in most cases you can commence arbitration through the American Arbitration Association.\n12.1.\nInformal dispute resolution:\nWe and you both agree to make reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve any dispute between us informally - you can contact us at legal@facepunch.com.\nNormally we would suggest that this dispute resolution period lasts 30 days unless exceptional circumstances exist.\nIf it is not resolved during this time, the next steps depend on where you live.\nIf you are resident in the European Union, you may be entitled to submit a complaint through the Online Dispute Resolution Platform operated by the European Commission, details of which can be found at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.\nIMPORTANT: IF YOU LIVE IN THE USA, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS CAREFULLY AS IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES BETWEEN US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n12.2.\nDispute resolution next steps: if you live in the European Union or elsewhere in the world (but not the USA):\nYou and we have the legal right to commence legal claims against each other if we consider it necessary.\nIf you bring a claim against Facepunch, you should address it to legal@facepunch.com.\n12.3.\nDispute resolution next steps: if you live in the USA: (a) Agreement to Arbitrate:\nWe and you agree to resolve all disputes and claims between us on an individual basis through binding arbitration, including without limitation any claims arising from or relating to this Agreement, any part of the relationship between you and us, or your use of the Facepunch Services, except as set forth under 'Exceptions to Informal Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate' below.\nThe US Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law applies to this agreement.\n\"Arbitration\" is a consensual dispute resolution process where both sides present their case to a neutral arbitrator rather than a judge or jury.\nArbitration is less formal than court litigation and review of an arbitrator's decision by a court is limited.\nTo be clear: by choosing arbitration you and we give up the right to have any dispute between us heard in court before a judge and/or jury.\nIndividual Arbitration Only: You and we agree that arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not as a class, consolidated or representative arbitration.\n(b) How to start an arbitration:\nEither of us can commence arbitration by filing an arbitration demand with the AAA that describes the claim and desired remedy.\nNotice sent to Facepunch should be sent by mail and by email.\nYou or Facepunch may bring an arbitration at the American Arbitration Association ('AAA') located in San Francisco, California.\n(c) The rules for the arbitration:\nThe arbitration will be governed by the AAA under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where applicable, its Consumer Arbitration Rules (available at http://www.adr.org), as modified by this Agreement.\nThe arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted in English by a single arbitrator with substantial experience in intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, selected pursuant to AAA rules.\nThe arbitration hearing may be conducted through the submission of documents, by phone, or in person, and must commence within thirty (30) days from the appointment of the arbitrator, unless otherwise agreed by you and Facepunch.\nJudgment upon an award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as appropriate.\nIf you seek US $10,000 or less, Facepunch will reimburse your filing fee and your share of the arbitration costs (but not your attorney's fees or expert witness fees), at the end of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator decides your claims are without merit or your costs are unreasonable.\nFacepunch will only seek its legal fees and costs if it prevails and the arbitrator determines your claims are meritless.\nIf you seek more than US $10,000, then the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and Facepunch per the applicable AAA rules.\n12.4.\nExceptions to Informal Dispute Resolution and Agreement to Arbitrate\nThe dispute resolution and arbitration requirements do not apply to claims or disputes that relate to claims of intellectual property rights infringement or claims of unauthorised use, piracy, theft or misappropriation.\n12.5.\nLimitation on Claims\nYou and Facepunch agree that, regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Facepunch Services must be made within one (1) year after the claim arose.\notherwise, such claim is permanently barred.\nYou agree that these dispute resolution and binding arbitration provisions will survive any termination of your account or the Facepunch Services.\nSUMMARY.\nIf you live in the USA or the rest of the world (but not the EU), you and we agree not to bring any class action or similar collective legal action against each other.\nWe will resolve legal disputes with each other through the process outlined above.\n12.6.\nWaiver of class action and collective action remedies:\nTo the maximum extent permitted by the national or state law applicable, you and we agree not under any circumstances to bring or participate in a class or representative action, private attorney general action or collective arbitration in relation to the Facepunch Services or this Agreement.\nThat means, to the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other.\n(2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-wide basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\nIf the previous paragraph is found illegal or unenforceable for any reason, you and Facepunch agree that any class, representative private attorney general action claim or dispute will be resolved in court.\n13.\nOTHER LEGAL MATTERS SUMMARY.\nThis section sets out a few additional, hopefully self-explanatory rules about how this Agreement works legally.\nFor example, this Agreement is just between you and us, we might be required to comply with law enforcement requests etc.\ni.\nIf any part of this Agreement is found not to be legally enforceable, this will not affect any other part of it.\nii.\nThis Agreement does not create any rights for anyone else.\niii.\nPlease remember that we are subject to various laws and we may be required to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements, including import/export controls.\niv.\nYou and we agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to the Facepunch Services or this Agreement.\nv.\nWe can assign, subcontract or transfer this Agreement to a third party or another member of our group if necessary for the support of the Facepunch Services, as part of any reorganisation or merger or for other business reasons.\nWe will notify you if this happens.\nvi.\nNo failure or delay by us or you to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law will constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor will it preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.\nNo single or partial exercise of such right or remedy by us or you will preclude or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.\nand\nvii.\nThis Agreement does not create any exclusive relationship between us nor any partnership, joint venture, employment or agency.\nPrivacy Policy Facepunch Privacy Policy\nLast updated on 28 August 2019 A quick summary: this document explains:\na) what information we and our

Mods are modifications of a game (or part of it) and/or new content or tools made for it by the community, whether standalone or integrated into our Games, which can range from small additions to complete overhauls ('Mods').\nFor example, Mods include creating a plugin which provides players with additional in-game options, a base-building tool or a new game mode for one of our Games.\nIt's not an exact definition but we think it works and if you're not sure you can always ask us.\n2.\nCan I make Mods for Facepunch Games? Yes (subject to these guidelines).\n3.\nWho owns the Mods?

We're OK with that in general terms but it's an area we're thinking about for the future so we reserve the right to issue new rules in the future.\nOur general thinking is the same as everywhere else - we don't want to get in the way where it doesn't make sense, but what everyone wants is stuff that does something new and adds value to the community (which we're not already providing) and follows the basic rules.\nTHE GOLDEN RULES: So everyone is clear, here's some rules we ask everyone to follow: 1.\nDon't call it 'official'.\nYour Fan Content should be clear that it's unofficial.\nPlease do not do or say anything which makes anyone think we endorse or support you.\nThe Fan Content you make based on our Games is solely your responsibility.\n2.\nDon't put it in other games/products.\nYour Fan Content based on our Games should stand on its own ' it should not be incorporated into a third-party game or product (whether or not for commercial use).\n3.\nDon't be a dick.\nPlease be respectful to other players and our Games.\nDo not do or say anything regarding us or our Games that is illegal or could harm our Games, Facepunch or any other players (e.g.\ncontent about cheating in our Games).\nYour Fan Content can use our Games of course, but please do not infringe the rights of other people or businesses (such as other games, movies, books, TV shows etc.).\nCheating, griefing or hacking our Games are strictly prohibited - please see the Facepunch Terms of Service (www.facepunch.com/legal/tos) for more information.\n4.\nAge appropriate.\nMake sure your Fan Content is suitable for the Games' target audience.\n5.\nFollow the legal rules.\nThese guidelines are our informal guidance to you, but the full legal rules are the Facepunch Terms of Service and Facepunch Privacy Policy at www.facepunch.com/legal.\nIf there is any conflict between these guidelines and those documents, then those documents win.\nYour ability to create, use and distribute Fan Content based on our Games is at our discretion and we can withdraw it in the future if we think it is necessary, particularly for the protection of Facepunch or our Games.\nDon't worry, we don't plan to use this arbitrarily or randomly, there has to be sufficient reason, but it's just common sense to point it out.\nCHANGES TO THESE GUIDELINES We expect these guidelines to be updated from time to time as people make new Fan Content based on our Games ' we will post an update online when that happens.\nOnce we change these guidelines, it will become legally binding as soon as it's posted online but you're welcome to contact us at legal@facepunch.com anytime if you have specific questions or concerns about the changes.\nIf you do not agree to those changes, then unfortunately you must stop using our services.\nANYTHING ELSE?
