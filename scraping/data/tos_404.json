"https://keybase.io/docs/privacypolicy", "xpath": "/html/body/div/div/div[5]", "text": " Keybase \u2013 Privacy Policy\n<p>Effective: January 9, 2020 (Posted December 9, 2019).</p>\n<p>At Keybase, our mission is to help you protect your privacy and your data.\nThis privacy policy explains how we process your personal information in service of that mission.</p>\nSummary\n<p>We hope you will read this entire privacy policy.\nHowever, if you\u2019re in a hurry, here are the key points:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keybase won\u2019t sell or rent your data or content for any reason.</li>\n<li>By design, Keybase can\u2019t access, sell, transmit, or use your encrypted content.</li>\n<li>We use a public blockchain to protect our users from misbehaving servers.\nBecause of that, you can\u2019t delete your publicly announced account information and account activity once you post it to your signature chain.\nYou can, however, revoke it.\nRevoking, in Keybase, means retracting the original statement, indicating that it\u2019s no longer true, or that the information has changed.</li>\n</ul>\nOur Business Model\n<p>We\u2019ll never run an ad-supported business.\nAnd Keybase will never sell your data.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we plan to offer a paid service and extra features for corporate teams, primarily.\nUntil then, we're building a product to bring public keys to the masses.</p>\nWhat personal information do we collect?\n<p>\n<em>Contact and account information</em>: We collect the information you provide to us, such as your name, avatar picture, email address, and social media handles.\nNote: Keybase never requires a phone number and no longer requires an email address in order to open and maintain an account.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Team names and membership</em>: If you create or join a team on Keybase, we collect and store the names of the teams and subteams, their membership, and when they were formed.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Hashed password</em>: We collect and store information about your Keybase password that allows you to prove you know your password.\nthat \u201cstretched\u201d password is sent to Keybase\u2019s servers.\nSee here for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Account activity</em>: We collect information about your activity while using the Services, such as proving you control a certain Twitter username, announcing your public key, editing your biographical information, or editing any of your social media usernames.\nSome of this information is aggregated, summarized, and published into the Bitcoin blockchain in order to detect and guard against certain vulnerabilities.\nSee \u201cDisclosures to your signature chain, the Merkle tree, and the Bitcoin blockchain\u201d below for information on how we treat this data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Files and Data</em>.\nWe collect and store files and information that you transmit to other parties using Keybase or that you elect to store on the Services.\nThis data is always encrypted on our servers, except for documents in your public folder and your public chats.\nThose are not encrypted because you choose to make those publicly accessible.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Do Not Track</em>.\nKeybase does not collect personally identifiable information from you to track you across third-party websites.\nAs a result, Keybase does not specifically respond to web browser Do Not Track signals.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Unique personal identifiers</em>.\nWe collect and store information to identify you, such as your Keybase user ID and your IP address (which is stored only temporarily).</p>\n<p>\n<em>Network usage and activity</em>.\nWe collect certain technical and analytics data, for example the type of device you\u2019re using to access our Services or the operating system you\u2019re running.\nKeybase is designed to store the minimum amount of technical data for the shortest time necessary in order for you to have the Services across all the devices you add.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Interactions with us</em>: If you email us, we may keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to the request and otherwise follow up as necessary.</p>\nHow do we use your information?\n<p>Here\u2019s how we use your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide the Services to you on all the devices you add.</li>\n<li>To protect our Services and users.\nFor example, we will use it to investigate suspicious activity and attacks.</li>\n<li>To improve Keybase for all our users.\nFor example, we will make development decisions based on what features our users are using.</li>\n<li>To communicate with you about Keybase.\nYou can unsubscribe from those messages (unless they are specifically about your account, and then we have to send them to you).</li>\n</ul>\nDisclosures to your signature chain, the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain\n<p>\n<strong>How and why do we use your signature chain, the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Every Keybase account has a public signature chain (called a sigchain), which is an ordered list of statements about how the account has changed over time.\nMeet the sigchains! Specifically, we announce into your sigchain your Keybase username, when you add a public key, additions or changes to your identity proofs (Twitter, Github, your website, etc.), public bitcoin address announcements, public follower statements, and device additions and revocations.\nThe list of statements grows over time as you change and add to your account.</p>\n<p>Every time you add to or change data in your sigchain, those changes are aggregated with the data that everyone else on Keybase adds or changes.\nThose aggregated changes are summarized (aka \u201chashed\u201d) into the root of Keybase\u2019s Merkle tree.</p>\n<p>Every 12 hours, that summary/hash in the Merkle tree gets published into the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>We do this to increase the security of your information.\nIt helps us to detect whether our servers have been compromised and are lying by omission or have been forked.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Can I delete information from my sigchain?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>No.\nFor your protection from, and detection of, hackers and other undesirable intrusions into the Services, it is not possible to delete data from your sigchain, or to change the hashes/summaries in the Merkle tree and the Bitcoin blockchain.\nIf you want to alter information that you have provided, the previously provided information cannot be deleted and can only be revoked.</p>\n<p>For example, if you change your Twitter username, your old Twitter username will not be deleted from your sigchain.\nInstead, you will append a new statement to your sigchain, revoking the old Twitter username.\nNobody is able to retroactively change the hashes into the Merkle tree and Bitcoin blockchain: the fact that the hashes cannot be changed is the essence of this security feature.\nAll of this means that <em>people will be able to discover your old Twitter username by looking at your sigchain.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Where can I find out more?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For a technical explanation of how Keybase supports \u201crevocations\u201d instead of \u201cdeletions\u201d, how they are chained together, and how they are hashed into the Merkle tree and Bitcoin blockchain, please read our paper documentation about our server security and how we use the Bitcoin blockchain to improve security.</p>\nWith whom do we share your information?\n<p>The content of your chat messages and private files is end-to-end encrypted.\nOnly you and those you communicate with will have the ability to see them.\nKeybase and third parties do not have access to this information.</p>\n<p>Service providers: We use the following service providers to process your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Amazon Web Services for content storage;</li>\n<li>Kraken.io for resizing unencrypted images such as user profile pictures;</li>\n<li>Note: Users can also opt in, via the chat interface, to Google location services (with the /location command) and Giphy (with the /giphy command) but those services don\u2019t receive personal information about you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Law &amp.\nOrder</em>: We may disclose your information to third parties if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with a valid legal process.\n(b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury.\n(c) prevent fraud or abuse.\nor (d) protect our rights, property, safety, or interest.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Cookies</em>: We use cookies to manage user sessions.\nYou can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.\nOur systems currently don\u2019t respond to DNT:1 signals from browsers visiting our websites.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sale or transfer of our business</em>.\nIf we sell, merge, reorganize, enter bankruptcy, or transfer any part of our business, we may be required to share your information before and after such an event.\nIf we do complete one of those transactions, we will notify you about any changes or transfers and this Privacy Policy will apply to the new entity.</p>\n<p>\n<em>We do not share or sell your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</em>\n</p>\nWhere do we store your information?\n<p>We transfer, process, and store your personal information in the United States.</p>\n<p>When transferring information from the European Union and the European Economic Area, we rely on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the European Economic Area to the United States.\nYou can also learn more about Privacy Shield at https://www.privacyshield.gov.</p>\n<p>JAMS is the US-based independent organization responsible for reviewing and resolving complaints about our Privacy Shield compliance\u2014free of charge to you.\nWe ask that you first submit any such complaints directly to us via privacy@keybase.io.\nIf you aren\u2019t satisfied with our response, please contact JAMS at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield.\nIn the event your concern still isn\u2019t addressed by JAMS, you may be entitled to binding arbitration under Privacy Shield and its principles.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance with the Privacy Shield.\nThe Privacy Shield Principles describe our accountability for personal data that we subsequently transfer to a third-party agent.\nUnder those Principles, we shall remain liable if third-party agents process the personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>\nHow do we secure your information?\n<p>Keybase takes reasonable security measures such as password protection, two-factor authentication for internal logins, client-side encryption, and a whitelist of employees who can deploy changes to the server, as we deem appropriate to protect the information we collect from misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nSome hosting details for the technically-minded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Services are currently hosted on Amazon\u2019s AWS;</li>\n<li>All data is transferred with industry standard TLS during transmission.\nand</li>\n<li>Keybase\u2019s website does not serve any 3rd party hosted JavaScript.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we do use care to protect your information, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nAs a result, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services, and you do so at your own risk.</p>\nWhat are our lawful bases for processing your information?\n<p>We rely on contractual necessity to process your data in order to provide and protect the Keybase Services.\nWe rely on our legitimate interests to perform research and development.</p>\nHow long do we store your information?\n<p>All of your chat messages and attachments are stored, encrypted, until you delete or explode them.\nIf you delete documents from KBFS, they remain encrypted on our servers for two weeks and are then deleted.\nWe store certain metadata for varying lengths of time in order for you to have access to Keybase over multiple devices or add new people to existing conversations.</p>\nHow can you exercise your rights over your information?\n<p>You have control over your personal information and how it is collected, used, and shared.\nFor example, you have a right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delete your account and all your associated data.\nYou can do this through your Keybase client.</li>\n<li>Erase or delete particular files and data.\nYou can do this through your Keybase client.\nYou can also set messages to delete automatically.</li>\n<li>Change or correct personal data.\nYou can do this through your Keybase client.</li>\n<li>Access and take your data to another service.\nYou can download your files through the Keybase client.\nContact us at privacy@keybase.io with any other questions or to make a data subject access request.</li>\n</ul>\nWill this privacy policy ever change?\n<p>We will update this Privacy Policy from time to time.\nIf we make any changes that reduce or negatively affect your privacy rights, you will be notified either through email or the Services.\nIf we only make minor changes that don\u2019t reduce your rights (like changing an email address or rewording paragraphs to make them clearer), we will just post the revised policy here.\nThose changes will go into effect on the \u201cEffective Date\u201d shown at the top of the updated Privacy Policy.\nYour continued use of the Services after the Effective Date means you agree to the new Privacy Policy.</p>\nOther questions?\n<p>Contact privacy@keybase.io.\nWe typically respond to requests within 30 days.</p> ", "created_at": "2019-11-02 21:20:52.112986", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 19:46:10.563232"}, {"id":

FULLY COMPENSATE YOU FOR ANY LOSSES OR FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES.\nIN SUCH AN EVENT THIS LIMITATION WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that the foregoing limitations are an essential element of the agreement between you and Keybase and that in the absence of such limitations the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms would be substantially different.</p>\nArbitration\n<p>These Arbitration and Class Action Waiver sections includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding).\nPlease read them carefully.\nYou may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p>\n<p>You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Keybase, you will first contact Keybase and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p>\nArbitration Agreement\n<p>After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Keybase\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Keybase or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration.\nThis mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Keybase.\nHowever, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Keybase for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases.\nIf you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below.</p>\n<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration.\nInstead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator.\nCourt review of an arbitration award is limited.\nExcept to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Keybase are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Keybase, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 28th Floor - NY, NY 10004.\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nIf you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used.\nThe AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>\n<p>The number of arbitrators will be one.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language and New York law will apply.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nIf you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.\nHowever, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Keybase and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@keybase.io within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service.</p>\nClass Action Waiver\n<p>Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d).\nThe parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum.\nIf the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration.\nAny claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.\nThe parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</p>\n<p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Keybase each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in New York, New York.</p>\nMiscellaneous Legal Terms\n<p>When we refer to \u201cKeybase\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d we mean Keybase, Inc., a Delaware corporation.</p>\n<p>If we need to provide notice to you, we will do so via your Keybase account or the email address we have on file for you.</p>\n<p>If a court holds that we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, you and we will replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will remain in effect.\nThis is the entire contract between you and us regarding the Service.\nIt supersedes any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>You may not assign these Terms or transfer any rights to use the Service.\nWe may assign our rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services.</p>\n<p>Keybase and you are not legal partners or agents.\nThese Terms are solely for your and our benefit.\nIt is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors.</p>\n<p>You must bring any claim related to these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims.\nIf it isn\u2019t filed in time, the claim is permanently barred.</p>\n<p>The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of laws
