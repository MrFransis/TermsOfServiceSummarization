information by cable operators, unless you provide us consent to collect or disclose information in another fashion, such as by accepting this Privacy Policy as part of the sign-up process for our Services.\nGenerally speaking, cable operators may not use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information concerning subscribers without their prior consent except to obtain information necessary to render our cable service or other services to our subscribers or to detect unauthorized reception of cable communications.\nIn addition, subject to certain specified exceptions, cable operators generally may not disclose personally identifiable information without consent of the subscriber concerned.\nAlso, cable operators must take such actions as are necessary to prevent unauthorized access to such information by a person other than the subscriber or cable operator.\nIf we violate your rights, you may be entitled to bring a civil action in a federal court, which may award actual, liquidated, and punitive damages, fees and costs, and other remedies that may be available.\nIn addition, if anyone asks us to provide information about you, we may have to notify you, and you may have the right to appear in court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications Act and CPNI.</strong> Under federal law, you have a right as a VoIP Customer, and we have a duty, to protect the confidentiality of your CPNI data.\nWe restrict access to your CPNI.\nFor example, call detail records, which contain information about the calls you make are available online.\nIn order to access call detail records online, you must have a Suddenlink ID and password.\nAll other CPNI is restricted by requiring a password and/or by requiring that you provide certain non-public verification information over the phone to confirm your identity.\nA written request may also be used to obtain your CPNI.\nYou must send the written request to Suddenlink at 200 Jericho Quadrangle,

Voice products and services to you.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS.</strong> The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00a7\u00a7

definition of personal information (\"CA Personal Information\") is broader than the definition of PII in Section 1.i above and may include information we collect when you use the Services or visit the Website, such as IP addresses, cookie IDs, and device IDs, to the extent such information is reasonably capable of being associated with or linked to a particular consumer or household.\nWe consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to the CA Personal Information we collect from Subscribers who are CA Residents when they provide it to us, use our Services, or visit our Website as described in Section 2 above.\nWe also consider ourselves to be a Business with respect to certain licensed demographic data we collect from third parties (see Section 2.c) as well as information we collect from non-Customer Users of the Website (see Section 2.d).\nThe CCPA provides CA Residents the right to know about the CA Personal Information collected, disclosed or sold about them by us as a

business or commercial purposes and the \"sale\" of CA Personal Information.\nWe consider our sharing of CA Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy and summarized in the chart above to the disclosure of such information for business or commercial purposes.\nWe do not sell Customers\u2019 or Website Users\u2019 CA Personal Information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Know and Deletion Requests.</strong> CA Residents have the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific information of CA Personal Information we have collected about them, the categories of sources of that information, the business or commercial purposes for which the information was collected, and the categories of third parties with whom it was shared (\"Right to Know Requests\").\nCA Residents also have the right to request that we delete the CA Personal Information that we have collected from them subject to certain exceptions, such as maintaining the information to continue to provide our services (\"Deletion Requests\").<br>\n<br> We will only be able to honor Right to Know and Deletion Requests for CA Residents whose identities we can verify, which is limited to current or former Customers.\nWe have no reasonable way to verify the identity of a CA Resident Website User who is not a current or former Customer, as the CA Personal Information we collect about these Users as a Business is limited to the information automatically collected on the Website as described in Section 2.d.<br>\n<br> CA Residents who are existing or former Customers, or their authorized agents (see Section 8.d below), may submit Right to Know and Deletion Requests by using the online form (available here), or may contact us at

Resident gives the authorized agent written permission to do so, the authorized agent submits verifiable proof of such written permission and their identity to us, and the CA Resident subsequently verifies to us that permission has been provided.\nIn the event a request is received by an authorized agent, we will follow up with both the agent and CA Resident seeking additional information to verify identities and ensure that a signed Authorized Agent permission form (available here) has been completed and submitted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CCPA Questions.</strong> If you are a CA Resident or authorized agent with questions regarding your rights under the CCPA you may contact us at CCPA@alticeusa.com or at the mailing address set forth in Section 9&nbsp;below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Shine the Light Law (Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00a7 1798.83).</strong> A separate California law requires that we provide CA Residents with notice and choice with respect to the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.\nIf you request it, we will provide you with a notice of your right to prevent sharing of your personal information as well as a cost-free means of doing so.\nYou may request such a notice by submitting a written request to customer.service@suddenlink.net specifying that you seek your \"California Customer Choice Notice.\" Please allow thirty days for a response.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</strong> We may change this Policy at any time.\nWe will notify you of material changes by posting the revised

be bound to this Residential Service Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with respect to all services (\"Service(s)\") provided by Suddenlink Communications and its affiliates and subsidiaries authorized to provide the services set forth herein (collectively, \"Suddenlink\"), other than those provided by Suddenlink Security.\nThe Agreement includes the general terms of service set forth below, as well as the additional terms of service applicable to the specific Suddenlink Services and features to which you subscribe or have access, including the cable television service (\"Video Service\"), high speed data service (\"High Speed Internet Service\"), voice service (\"Phone Service\"), support services and mobile apps, as are set forth below or at www.suddenlink.com/terms-and-policies and may be updated from time to time (collectively, the \"Additional Terms of Service\"), which are incorporated in this Agreement by reference.\nYou further understand and agree that the Suddenlink Communications Privacy Policy (\"Privacy Policy\"), which governs the collection, use and disclosure of Customer personal information, is likewise incorporated herein by reference.\nFor purposes of clarity, \"Services\" as defined herein excludes any services or equipment provided by Suddenlink Security, which are covered by a separate agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND JURY TRIALS.\nTHE AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR OPTING OUT OF ARBITRATION.\nPLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE APPLICABLE TO SERVICES</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SERVICE FOR VIDEO SERVICE</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SERVICE FOR HIGH SPEED INTERNET SERVICES</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL TERMS OF SERVICE FOR PHONE SERVICE</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE APPLICABLE TO SERVICES <p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.\n<strong>Payment of Charges.</strong> The charges for one month of Services, including any deposits, activation, installation and Equipment charges, are due upon installation of the Services or such other date as agreed by Suddenlink and You.\nThereafter, Customer agrees to pay monthly recurring Service charges and Equipment charges (if any) in advance, including all applicable fees (such as restoration or experience fees), taxes, regulatory fees, franchise fees, surcharges (including sports and broadcast tv surcharges) and other government assessments no later than the date indicated on Customer's bill.\nCharges for non-recurring Services or Equipment charges will be reflected on Customer's subsequent bill at the then current applicable rates.\nFor instance, Customer will be billed monthly for Pay Per View, On Demand or other Services ordered where charges are based on actual usage or on orders placed during the previous month.\nAll rates for Services, Equipment charges and other fees and surcharges are subject to change in accordance with applicable law.\nIf Customer elects to pay by automatic recurring credit card, debit card or automatic clearing house payments, Customer authorizes Suddenlink to charge such accounts.\nIf Customer elects to send a check as payment, Customer authorizes Suddenlink either to use information from Customer\u2019s check to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Customer\u2019s bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction.</p>\n<p>Failure to receive a bill does not release Customer from Customer's obligation to pay.\nFailure to pay the total balance when due (including checks returned for insufficient funds) shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for termination of Service, removal of Equipment from Customer's premises and/or imposition of a late fee (\"Late Fee\") in accordance with applicable law.\nYou can avoid incurring Late Fees by paying your monthly bill promptly.\nAny Late Fee imposed on Customer is intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of costs of managing past due accounts.\nThe Late Fee is not interest, a penalty, a credit service charge or a finance charge.</p>\n<p>If the Customer has more than one account (Business and/or Residential) served by Suddenlink, all Suddenlink provided Services at all locations may be subject to discontinuance of Service in the event any one account remains unpaid.\nIn the event collection activities are required, an additional collection charge may be imposed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Monthly Subscriptions:</strong> Your monthly subscription begins either on or the first day following your installation date and automatically renews thereafter on a monthly basis beginning on the first day of the next billing period assigned to you until cancelled by you.\nThe monthly service charge(s) will be billed at the beginning of your assigned billing period and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your Service(s).\nPAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS.</p>\n<p>You may cancel Service(s) up to the last day of the billing period prior to the service period that you wish to cancel, and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current billing period.\nAny request for cancellation after the commencement of a service period will be effective at the end of the then-current service period.\nAccess to the Services will, if possible, continue to be provided at the location ordered or, if you move, to your new location if in a Suddenlink-served area (subject to any installation charges).</p>\n<p>2.<strong> Additional Fees.\n</strong>In addition to Customer's monthly recurring charges and any Late Fee, additional fees may be imposed, including fees for returned checks, Payment Assistance Fees for paying by phone, receiving a paper bill, charge card chargeback, early termination, reconnection and service calls.\nAdditional charges may also be imposed if collection activities are required to recover past due balances, including attorney fees.\nA list of applicable fees (\"Schedule of Fees\") is available at www.suddenlink.com/pricing-packages.\nSuddenlink reserves the right to amend or change the Schedule of Fees from time to time.</p>\n<p>3.\n<strong>Third Party Provider Charges</strong>.\nIn connection with Customer\u2019s use of the Services and Equipment, Customer may be able to access, subscribe to, use and/or purchase products, services, software or applications that are provided to Customer by third parties (\"Third Party Providers\").\nCustomer acknowledges that Customer may incur charges in connection with the subscription to, purchase or use of these Third Party Provider products, services, software or applications.\nAll such charges, including any additional fees and applicable taxes, shall be paid by Customer to the Third Party Provider and are not the responsibility of Suddenlink.\nCredits or billing adjustments for products, services, software or applications billed by a Third Party Provider shall be subject to the stated billing practices of that Third Party Provider.\nTermination of a service or subscription offered for a separate charge billed directly by a Third Party Provider shall be effected in accordance with the Terms of Service or similar agreement between the Customer and the Third Party Provider.</p>\n<p>4.\n<strong>Taxes</strong>.\nCustomer agrees to pay any local, state or federal taxes imposed or levied on or with respect to the Services, the Equipment or installation or service charges incurred with respect to the same.</p>\n<p>5.\n<strong>Early Termination Fees.\n</strong>If you cancel, terminate or downgrade the Service(s) before the completion of any required promotional term to which You agreed (\"Initial Term\"), you agree to pay Suddenlink any applicable early cancellation fee plus all outstanding charges for all Services used and Equipment purchased for which you have not paid us prior to termination.\nYou agree that early cancellation fees or any other fees may automatically be charged to your account and your credit or debit card provided to Suddenlink Communications and you agree to pay such fees.</p>\n<p>6.\n<strong>Right to Make Credit Inquiries.</strong> Customer acknowledges and agrees that Suddenlink may (a) verify Customer's credit standing, make inquiries and receive information about your credit experiences, including your credit report, from credit reporting agencies.\n(b) enter this information in your file, and disclose this information concerning you to appropriate third parties for reasonable business purposes.\nand (c) furnish information about you (including your social security number), your account(s) and your payment history to those credit reporting agencies.</p>\n<p>7.\n<strong>Security Deposits.\n</strong>Suddenlink may require a deposit or activation fee based on Customer's credit standing or past payment history with Suddenlink.\nA deposit and/or activation fee does not relieve the Customer of the responsibility for the prompt payment of bills on presentation.\nAny security deposit given by Customer for the Equipment or Suddenlink's Service will be due and payable upon the first monthly billing.\nSuch security deposits will be returned to Customer within sixty (60) days of termination of Suddenlink's Service so long as payment has been made for all amounts due on Customer's account and Customer has returned the Suddenlink Equipment undamaged.\nSecurity deposits paid by Customer for Equipment or Services may be used, to the extent permitted by law, to offset any unpaid balance or charges after termination of Service.\nCustomer shall remain liable for any outstanding balances after the security deposit has been applied.\nFurther terms and conditions of the security deposit may be contained in the deposit receipt given to Customer at the time the security deposit is collected.</p>\n<p>8.\n<strong>Disputed Charges.</strong> Customer agrees to pay all undisputed monthly charges and all applicable fees and taxes as itemized on the Suddenlink monthly bill and notify Suddenlink in writing of disputed items or requests for credit within thirty (30) days of Customer\u2019s receipt of the bill for which correction of an error or credit is sought, or longer as provided by applicable law.\nThe date of the dispute shall be the date Suddenlink receives sufficient documentation to enable Suddenlink to investigate the dispute.\nThe date of the resolution is the date Suddenlink completes its investigation and notifies the Customer of the disposition of the dispute.</p>\n<p>9.\n<strong>Adjustments or Refunds.</strong> Any adjustment or refund, given in each case in Suddenlink\u2019s sole discretion, will be accomplished by a credit on a subsequent bill for Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the liability of Suddenlink, its officers, shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, vendors, carrier partners, content providers and other persons or entities involved in providing the Services or Equipment (collectively, the \"Suddenlink Parties\") for damages shall in no event, by reason of any delays, interruptions, omissions, errors, failures or defects in installation or service, exceed an amount equal to the Customer's Service charges and associated Equipment fees for a regular billing period (\"Maximum Credit\").\nNo credit allowance will be made for interruptions of Service that are:</p>\n<p>a.\ndue to the negligence of or noncompliance with the provisions of the Agreement by Customer or any person authorized by customer to use the Service;</p>\n<p>b.\ndue to the negligence of any person other than Suddenlink including, but not limited to, the other common carriers connected to the Suddenlink's facilities;</p>\n<p>c.\ndue to the failure or malfunction of Customer-owned equipment or third party equipment;</p>\n<p>d.\nduring any period in which Suddenlink is not given full and free access to its facilities and Equipment for the purpose of investigating and correcting interruptions;</p>\n<p>e.\nduring a period in which Customer continues to use the Service on an impaired basis;</p>\n<p>f.\nduring any period when the interruption is due to implementation of a Customer order for a change in Service arrangements.\nor</p>\n<p>g.\ndue to circumstances or causes beyond the control of Suddenlink.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Limitation of Refund.</u> Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the event any amounts owed by Suddenlink to Customer are not claimed by Customer within one year of the date on which the amount became payable to Customer, Customer shall forfeit all rights to the refund and all such amounts shall become the property of Suddenlink.</p>\n<p>10.\n<strong>Equipment and Software.</strong> Unless Suddenlink expresses otherwise in writing, all equipment, including but not limited to, any cables, wires, amplifiers, cable boxes, access cards, remotes, cable cards, battery backup units, modems, routers, gateways, Altice One and Altice One Mini units distributed to and/or installed for use in the Customer\u2019s service location(s) by or on behalf of Suddenlink (\"Equipment\"), network facilities, and software installed or provided by Suddenlink remains the property of Suddenlink, except that all wiring on the Customer\u2019s side of the demarcation point at Customer\u2019s service location, whether installed by Suddenlink or by Customer, shall be Customer property and not Suddenlink Equipment, and repair and maintenance for such wiring is the responsibility of Customer unless otherwise agreed by Customer and Suddenlink.\nThe demarcation point shall mean a point at (or about) twelve (12) inches outside of where the cable wire enters the Customer\u2019s service location.\nNone of the Equipment shall become a fixture nor shall distribution, installation, and/or use of Equipment, including but not limited to cable boxes and/or set top boxes be deemed a lease of such Equipment.\nCustomer will acquire no ownership or other interest in the Equipment, network facilities, and software by virtue of payments made pursuant to this Agreement or by the attachment of any portion of the Equipment or network facilities to Customer's residence or premises.</p>\n<p>a.\n<u>Misuse of Equipment.</u> Suddenlink Equipment is intended to service and reside at the specific service location and is not to be removed from the service location where it was installed or used off premises without Suddenlink authorization.\nCustomer agrees that neither Customer nor any other person (except Suddenlink\u2019s authorized personnel) will open, alter, misuse, tamper with, service, or make any alterations to any Equipment.\nCustomer will not remove any markings or labels from the Equipment.\nCustomer agrees to safeguard the Equipment from loss or damage of any kind, and (except for any self installation procedures approved by Suddenlink) will not permit anyone other than a Suddenlink authorized representative to perform any work on the Equipment.\nAny misuse, alteration, tampering, or removal, or the use of equipment which permits the receipt of Services without authorization or the receipt of Services to an unauthorized number of outlets, or to unauthorized locations constitutes theft of service and is prohibited.</p>\n<p>b.\n<u>Return of Equipment.</u> If Customer's Service is terminated or cancelled (for whatever reason), unless Suddenlink expresses otherwise in writing, Customer agrees that Customer no longer has the right to keep or use the Equipment and Customer must promptly return the Equipment.\nThe Equipment must be returned to Suddenlink in the same condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted.\nAbsent other instructions, if Customer fails to return the Equipment, Customer will pay any expenses Suddenlink incurs in retrieving the Equipment.\nFailure of Suddenlink to remove the Equipment does not mean that Suddenlink has abandoned the Equipment.\nSuddenlink may impose a charge for unreturned Equipment to be determined in accordance with Suddenlink\u2019s then current schedule of charges for non-returned Equipment and/or continue to charge Customer a monthly Service fee every month until any remaining Equipment is returned, collected by Suddenlink or fully paid for by Customer.\nAny charge for unreturned Equipment shall be due immediately.</p>\n<p>c.\n<u>Damaged or Lost Equipment.</u> If the Equipment is damaged by Customer, destroyed, lost or stolen while in Customer's possession, Customer is responsible for the cost of repair or replacement of the Equipment.</p>\n<p>d.\n<u>Operation of Equipment.</u> The Customer agrees to operate any Equipment in accordance with instructions of Suddenlink or Suddenlink's agent.\nFailure to do so will relieve the Suddenlink Parties of liability for interruption of Service and may make the Customer responsible for damage to Equipment.</p>\n<p>e.\n<u>Tests and Inspections.</u> Upon reasonable notification to the Customer, and at a reasonable time, Suddenlink may make such tests and inspections as may be necessary to determine that the Customer is complying with the requirements set forth herein.</p>\n<p>f.\n<u>Software.</u> Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of any software license agreement applicable to the software provided or installed by Suddenlink (\"Software\").\nThe Software shall be used solely in connection with the Services and Customer will not modify, disassemble, translate or reverse engineer, the Software.\nAll rights title and interest to the Software, including associated intellectual property rights, are and will remain with Suddenlink and Suddenlink\u2019s licensors.\nIf Customer's Service is terminated, Customer will promptly return or destroy all Software provided by Suddenlink and any related written materials.\nSuddenlink will have the right to upgrade, modify and enhance the Equipment and Software from time to time.</p>\n<p>g.\n<u>Repair.</u> Suddenlink will repair and/or replace defective Software or Equipment provided such damage was not caused by misuse, neglect or other fault of Customer.\nSuddenlink assumes no responsibility and shall have no responsibility for the operation, maintenance, condition or repair of any Customer-provided equipment and/or software, including, but not limited to, televisions, computer devices, remote controls or other consumer electronics, including any hardware or third party software, that may be connected to the Services (\"Customer Equipment\"), except that Suddenlink may automatically push required software or firmware updates directly to Customer Equipment when necessary for the provision of Suddenlink Service(s).\nCustomer is responsible for the repair and maintenance of Customer Equipment.\nCustomer is also responsible for the repair and maintenance of inside wiring at the service location unless otherwise agreed by Customer and Suddenlink.\nSuddenlink is not responsible or liable for any loss or impairment of Suddenlink\u2019s Service due in whole or in part to a malfunction, defect or otherwise caused by Customer Equipment.\nSuddenlink makes no warranties, with respect to Equipment or Service provided by Suddenlink or with respect to the Equipment's compatibility with any Customer Equipment.</p>\n<p>11.\n<strong>Prohibitions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<u>Residential Use</u>.\nThe

understand and comply with all terms and conditions applicable to the Services.</p>\n<p>13.\n<strong>Access to Customer Premises.</strong> Customer grants Suddenlink and its employees, agents, contractors, and representatives the right to access and otherwise enter Customer's premises and access Equipment, the wiring within Customer's premises and Customer's computer(s) and other devices to install, connect, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, disconnect, remove or alter the Equipment, check for signal leakage, or install or deliver Suddenlink provided Software.\nCustomer shall cooperate in providing such access upon request of Suddenlink.\nIf Customer is not the owner of the premises, Customer warrants that Customer has obtained the legal authority of the owner to authorize Suddenlink personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for the purposes described herein.\nSuddenlink\u2019s failure to remove its Equipment shall not be deemed an abandonment thereof.</p>\n<p>14.\n<strong>Violations of this Agreement</strong>: It shall be a violation of this Agreement for Customer or any User: (1) to engage in any conduct prohibited by this Agreement (or by any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference).\nor (2) not to engage in conduct required by this Agreement, each case determined in Suddenlink\u2019s sole good faith discretion.\nIn

customer support.\nor</p>\n<p>f.\nThe amount of customer and/or technical support required to be provided to Customer or any User is excessive in the sole good faith discretion of Suddenlink.</p>\n<p>15.\n<strong>Termination.</strong> Suddenlink may terminate this Agreement, disconnect any or all Services, and remove Equipment at any time, without prior notice, for any reason whatsoever or for no reason, including, but not limited to, if Customer or a User fails to fully comply with the terms of this Agreement and/or any Suddenlink or authorized Third Party Provider terms of service, agreements or policies incorporated herein by reference.\nIf Suddenlink terminates Service due to a violation of this Agreement or Suddenlink's policies, Customer may be subject to

attention of federal, state, and local executive or administrative agencies.</p>\n<p>Resolving Your dispute with Suddenlink through arbitration means You will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court before a judge or jury.\n<strong>YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SUDDENLINK EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\n<u>Opting Out of Arbitration.</u>\n<strong> IF YOU HAVE BEEN AN EXISTING CUSTOMER FOR AT LEAST 30

Dispute.</u> Before commencing an action in arbitration, You must first notify us of Your dispute and allow us an opportunity to resolve it without the need for arbitration.\nYou must write us a letter briefly explaining the dispute and stating the relief that You demand.\nProvide as much information as possible, including where applicable dates and specific amounts of money.\nAlso include the account holder's name, the account number, the service address, and a telephone number at which You may be reached during business hours.\nFor Your convenience, You may download a Notice of

Altice Shared Services, 200 Jericho Quadrangle, Jericho, NY 11753, Attn: Customer Disputes.</p>\n<p>ii.\n<u>30 Day Wait Period.</u> If Suddenlink has not been able to resolve your dispute to your satisfaction within 30 days from when we received your Notice of Dispute, you may start arbitration proceedings.</p>\n<p>c.\n<u>Commencing an Arbitration</u>.\nTo commence an arbitration, you must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, with a copy to Suddenlink.\nA Demand for Arbitration form can be found on the AAA website at https://www.adr.org/rulesformsfees.</p>\n<p>d.\n<u>Arbitration Process.</u> The arbitration will be administered by the AAA under the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision.\nYou may obtain copies of those rules from the AAA at www.adr.org.\nIf the AAA will not enforce this arbitration provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve Your dispute.\nIf this situation arises, or if the AAA for any reason cannot serve as the arbitration organization, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization or ad hoc arbitration, which will enforce this arbitration provision as to the dispute.\nIf the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization or ad hoc arbitrator that will administer arbitration under this arbitration provision as written.\nIf there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the AAA rules, this arbitration provision shall govern.</p>\n<p>A single arbitrator will resolve the dispute between You and Suddenlink.\nParticipation in arbitration may result in limited discovery.\nThe arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect confidential or proprietary information, including Customer personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision, or the interpretation of its prohibitions of class, representative, and private attorney general proceedings and non-individualized relief shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nThe Arbitrator is limited and bound by terms of this arbitration provision.\nAlthough the arbitrator shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law, the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nAn award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>\n<p>Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in the county (or parish) of Your service address.\nIf the amount in dispute is less than $50,000, Suddenlink agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration is conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.</p>\n<p>If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or the claim seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.\nAn award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal.\nThe members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules.\nThe three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.\nThe decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.</p>\n<p>e.\n<u>Arbitration Fees.</u> Except as otherwise provided in this arbitration provision, Suddenlink will pay all arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration that Suddenlink commences or that You commence seeking damages of $10,000 or less.\nIf You commence an arbitration seeking greater than $10,000 in damages, arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees shall be allocated in accordance with the AAA rules.\nIf You cannot pay Your share of these fees, You may request a fee waiver from the AAA.\nIn addition, Suddenlink will consider reimbursing Your share of these fees if You indicate You cannot afford them and, if appropriate, will pay directly all such fees upon Your written request prior to the commencement of the arbitration.\nYou are responsible for all additional costs and expenses that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys\u2019 or expert witness fees and expenses, unless the arbitrator determines that applicable law requires Suddenlink to pay those costs and expenses.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator concludes that Your claim is frivolous or has been brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the AAA rules shall govern the allocation of arbitration fees, and You agree to reimburse Suddenlink for any amounts Suddenlink may have paid on Your behalf.</p>\n<p>f.\n<u>Governing Law.</u> Because the Service(s) provided to You involves interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes under this arbitration provision.\nAny state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall not be applicable.</p>\n<p>g.\n<u>Waiver of Class and Representative Actions.</u>\n<strong> YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE YOUR DISPUTE AND TO DO SO ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, AND PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATIONS AND ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</strong> You and Suddenlink agree that each party may bring claims against the other only in Your or its individual capacity and may not participate as a class member or serve as a named plaintiff in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding.\nThis arbitration provision does not permit and explicitly prohibits the arbitration of consolidated, class, or representative disputes of any form.\nIn addition, although the arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other Suddenlink account holders, neither You nor Suddenlink may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, non-individualized relief that would affect other account holders.\nFurther, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's claims unless all parties affirmatively agree in writing.</p>\n<p>If any of the prohibitions in the preceding paragraph is held to be unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court.\nIn that instance, or any instance when a claim between You and Suddenlink proceeds to court rather than through arbitration, You and Suddenlink each waive the right to any trial by jury through this Agreement.</p>\n<p>h.\n<u>Severability and Survival.</u> If any other portion of this arbitration provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the remainder of this arbitration provision shall be given full force and effect.\nThe terms of the arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>25.\n<strong>Governing Law.</strong> Subject to Section 24.f above, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York.</p>\n<p>26.\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any term or condition of this Agreement shall be adjudicated or determined as invalid or unenforceable by a court, tribunal or arbitrator with appropriate jurisdiction over the subject matter, the remainder of the Agreement with respect to such claim shall not be affected and shall remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>\n<p>27.\n<strong>No Relationship.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement will create any joint venture, joint employer, franchisee-franchisor, employer-employee or principal-agent relationship between Suddenlink and any content, backbone, network, circuit and other technology or communications providers, software and other licensors, hardware and equipment suppliers or other third party providers of elements of the High Speed Internet Service, nor impose upon any such companies any obligations for any losses, debts or other obligations incurred by the other.</p>\n<p>28.\n<strong>Survival.</strong> All representations, warranties, indemnifications, dispute resolution provisions and limitations of liability contained in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, as well as any other obligations of the parties hereunder which, by their terms, would be expected to survive such termination or which relate to the period prior to termination (including legal conditions, payment, and Suddenlink rights and the rights of others).</p>\n<p>29.\n<strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Suddenlink Parties shall not be liable for any delay or failure of performance or Equipment due to causes beyond its control, including but not limited to: acts of God, fire, flood, explosion or other catastrophes.\nany law, order, regulation, direction,

with national emergencies, acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, wars, unavailability of rights-of-way, material shortages, strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages.</p>\n<p>30.\n<strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement, including the applicable Additional Terms of Service, Privacy Policy and Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\"), the work/service order presented to You at time of installation (\"Service Order\") and the Schedule of Fees constitute the entire agreement between Suddenlink and Customer with respect to the Services.\nNo undertaking, representation or warranty made by an agent or representative of Suddenlink in connection with the sale, installation, maintenance or removal of Suddenlink's Services or Equipment shall be binding on Suddenlink except as expressly included herein.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>31.\n<strong>Amendment.\nNotice</strong>.\nSuddenlink may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time.\nSuddenlink

wireless routers, gateways, managed access points and Altice One devices (with built-in router/gateway) (each, a \"Suddenlink Router/Gateway\") are available to certain Customers and provide wireless access to the High Speed Internet Service within the Customer's residence (\"Home Network\").\nSuddenlink Router/Gateways come programmed with certain default settings and configurations for the Home Network.\nCustomers may modify certain of the default settings and configurations on the Suddenlink Router/Gateway although Suddenlink recommends maintaining the default configuration and settings.\nSuddenlink does not guarantee the security of the Suddenlink Router/Gateway and Customer's connection to the High Speed Internet Service via the Home Network.\nCustomer understands and agrees that Customer is solely responsible for the security of his/her Home Network.\nSuddenlink Router/Gateways are preconfigured to distribute hotspots for additional Suddenlink wireless networks in

Optimum/Suddenlink internet customers, Altice Mobile customers and certain other authorized users.\nThe Home Network is encrypted and has separate security settings from the Suddenlink Network Hotspots.\nCustomer understands that simultaneous connections to both the Home Network and a Suddenlink Network Hotspot may not be available and that after a device is connected to the Home Network, the primary connection for the Customer and any devices using Customer's login credentials, while in the home, will be to the Home Network.\nAny use of bandwidth from such wireless access point by third parties, will not be considered to be use by the Customer for any purpose.\nThe Suddenlink Router/Gateway will collect and maintain certain information regarding access to and use of the Home Network, which information shall include but not be limited to device identifiers, device name, device type, applications and protocols, connections, and traffic flows.\nSuch information will be used by Suddenlink to provide the High Speed Internet Service and support as well as for Altice's internal business analytics regarding the use of the High Speed Internet Service.\nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that Suddenlink shall have access to the password associated with the Suddenlink Router/Gateway in order to provide support and diagnostic services.\nSuddenlink reserves the right to modify the password for the Suddenlink Router/Gateway in order to safeguard Internet security, the security and privacy of Customer information, where required by law, and/or for other good cause to provide, upgrade and maintain the High Speed Internet Service, and protect the network, other users of the Internet, or our Customers.\nSuddenlink shall notify Customer of any such password modifications.\nCustomer acknowledges that the Suddenlink Router/Gateway is Suddenlink Equipment.<br>\n<br>\nIn certain circumstances, a range extender or WiFi extender may be required to be installed and connected to the Suddenlink Router/Gateway in order to connect wirelessly to the High Speed Internet Service throughout Customer\u2019s residence.\nA monthly extender equipment fee may apply.\nCustomer understands and agrees that where the Suddenlink Router/Gateway is a wireless router (as opposed to a gateway or Altice One device), and a range extender is required, the Suddenlink-recommended installation method is through a wired connection directly to the Suddenlink Router/Gateway.\nCustomer understands and agrees that wireless router range extender installations are not recommended by Suddenlink and such wireless installations may not successfully resolve any or all wireless signal strength and/or wireless signal range-related issues (issue list not exhaustive).\nSuddenlink continues to recommend a wired installation to best resolve wireless connectivity issues within your service location.</p>\n<p>21.\n<strong>Enforcement of Policy and AUP.</strong> Customer authorizes Suddenlink and its affiliates to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the investigation or prosecution of criminal violations, and with system administrators

cooperation may include providing certain Customer identifying information to these parties.</p>\n<p>22.\n<strong>Tracking Devices and Viruses.</strong> Customer acknowledges that accessing certain websites through the High Speed Internet Service may result in \"cookies\" and other tracking devices to be entered in Customer's computer equipment and stored on Customer's browser.\nIt is Customer's responsibility to disable the entry of \"cookies\" or other tracking devices following procedures, if available, on Customer's browser.\nCustomer further acknowledges that using the High Speed Internet Service may result in harmful viruses being downloaded and stored on Customer's computer.\nIt is Customer's responsibility to protect Customer's computer and data from harmful viruses by
