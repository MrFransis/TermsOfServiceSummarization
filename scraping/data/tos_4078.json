microphone data, which is used for the purpose\nof taking photos and recording videos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera.\nMicrophone permission is also used for the optional \"Audio control\" options.</p>\n<p>Open Camera requires permission (at least for Android 9 and earlier, or using versions of Open Camera older than 1.48.3) to \"access photos, media and files on your devices\" (storage permission), as this permission is required for Android to save resultant files such as photos and videos to your device.</p>\n<p>Location permission is required for the optional geotagging features (for photos and videos, including stamp and subtitles options).\nWhen relevant option(s) are enabled, your device location will be stored in photo/video/subtitle files.\nLocation permission is also required to connect to Bluetooth remote control devices.</p>\n<p>Bluetooth permission is required for communicating with some supported Bluetooth remote control devices.</p>\n<p>Since Open Camera also uses operating system APIs, you should review relevant privacy policies such as for your device, manufacturer, operating system and/or Google accounts.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The optional voice control option uses the Android speech recognition service.\nWhen enabled, audio data is likely to be sent to remote servers by Android to perform speech recognition.\n</li>\n<li>The \"addresses\" option for photo stamp or video subtitles uses the Android Geocoder API.\nWhen enabled, this requires that your device transmits location data across the Internet to a third party (which may depend on what \"backend services\" are installed on your device).\n</li>\n<li>Apps/services such as cloud services on your device may auto-upload photos and videos that are saved on your device.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although Open Camera is ad-free, the Open Camera website has ads via Google Adsense: Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to\nserve ads based on a user's
