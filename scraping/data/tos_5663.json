providers to collect and store, information that does not identify you personally that is generated automatically as you navigate through the site.\n&nbsp;For example, we and our service providers may collect limited information about the configuration of your computer or other device through which you visit our site, including the type of browser software you use, the operating system you\u2019re running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the Web site that referred you, the type of mobile device you\u2019re using to access our site (for example, iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, Android device, tablet, etc.), and your IP address.\n&nbsp;(Your IP address is a numerical address that is used by computers connected to the Internet to identify your computer so that data \u2013 such as the Web pages you want to view \u2013 can be transmitted to you.\n&nbsp;We also use IP address information for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.) &nbsp;We use this information to make our site as useful as we can for as many users as possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Cookies and Pixel Tags</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use \u201ccookies,\u201d a standard feature found in browser software, to enhance your experience on the site.\n&nbsp;Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.\n&nbsp;We also may use pixel tags (sometimes referred to as \u201cclear GIFs\u201d or \u201cWeb beacons\u201d) to collect non-personally identifying information about how our visitors use our site.\n&nbsp;By showing how and when visitors and registered users use the site, cookies and pixel tags help us deliver more relevant content to users, identify how many unique users visit our site and various pages within our site, and anonymously track user interests, trends and patterns.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may use these technologies to collect aggregate information about the time visitors spend on each page of our site, the number of visits made to each page or section of our site, and the content that visitors select and copy using the standard copy and paste tool provided in standard Web browsers.\n&nbsp;Providers of web analytics services may use cookies and pixel tags to gather this sort of information on our behalf.\n&nbsp;And Advertisers that display ads or other promotional messages (\u201cAds\u201d) on our site (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) may use cookies and pixel tags of their own in connection with Ads displayed on our site, as described below under the heading \u201cData Collected in Connection with Ads.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Providers of email transmission services use pixel tags to record whether an email is opened and whether you click on any of the links in the email, as described below under the heading \u201cData Collected in Connection with Emails.\u201d</p>\n<p>We also may use cookies to record certain preferences that you enter or set while using the site.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you are a registered user and you opt to have the site \u201cremember you,\u201d we\u2019ll use cookies to automatically store your log-in information so that you won\u2019t have to re-enter it the next time you visit.</p>\n<p>The help function on most Web browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting a cookie or to disable cookies entirely.&nbsp.\nHowever, if you don\u2019t accept cookies, you won\u2019t be able to take advantage of various features on our site that are available to other visitors.&nbsp.\nFor example, we won\u2019t be able to store your log-in information, so that you don\u2019t have to log in each time you visit, unless you accept cookies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW WE USE COLLECTED INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Generally</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the site in a variety of ways, including, for example, to process your registration, to provide you with services and communications that you have requested, to send you email updates, newsletters, and other communications which you have elected to receive, to deliver our site content to you, to measure site traffic, to measure user interests and traffic patterns, and to improve the site and the services and features offered via the site.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Your Email Address</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition, we may use your email address to contact you for customer service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our site or the services offered over our site, to send you administrative notices and other information about our site, and to tell you about other products or services offered by TWT, or other companies, that we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp.\nIf you subscribe to any of our newsletters, we\u2019ll use your email address to send the newsletters to you.\n&nbsp;Although we hope you\u2019ll find these communications informative and useful, if you don\u2019t, you can always unsubscribe to either type of message by following the simple instructions included in each email.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Information You Provide When Making a Purchase</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you purchase any product or service on our site, we collect the information necessary to process the requested transaction, such as your name, email address, mailing address, billing address, and credit/debit card or PayPal account information.&nbsp.\nYour credit/debit card information is sent to our third-party credit card processor and is secured during transmission over the Internet using industry-standard secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption.&nbsp.\nOur credit card processor is authorized to use your credit/debit card information only to process your requested transaction, and for no other purpose.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Data Collected in Connection with Ads</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Advertisers that display Ads on our site (and other advertising services) may use cookies and pixel tags of their own to record your Web browser\u2019s interaction with a given Ad.&nbsp.\nThis technique allows the Advertiser (and its providers of ad serving and other advertising services) to track how Ads are displayed, and which are clicked on, and to limit the number of times a given Ad is shown to you.&nbsp.\nThe use of cookies and pixel tags may also enable these Advertisers (and their providers of ad serving and other advertising services) to serve ads to our users based on their perceived interests as gleaned from their visits to this and other Web sites.&nbsp.\nFor example, DoubleClick, a provider of ad serving and other advertising services, may set cookies in connection with Ads displayed on our Web site through our relationship with Google.&nbsp.\nFor a detailed description of Google\u2019s interest-based advertising program, or to opt out of receiving interest-based ads from Google,&nbsp;<strong>click here</strong>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Similarly, LiveRamp, another provider of advertising services, may set cookies in connection with Ads displayed on our Web site, and may use behavioral targeting methods to select which ads to display.\nThese cookies contain no personally identifiable information.\n&nbsp;The cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you voluntarily have submitted to us, e.g., your email address, which we may share with a data provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.\nTo opt-out of these data provider cookies, please go to: http://optout.aboutads.info/.\nAnother provider of advertising services, Nativo, may collect certain information, through the use of cookies, about the Web site and its users.\nTo opt-out of this data collection please go to: https://www.nativo.net/.&nbsp;Another
