and</li>\n<li>Update the limited permission granted to teachers and educators for sharing our Content during COVID-19 to include an expiration date of December 31, 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\nTerms of Service\nLast revised: October 21, 2021\n<p>This website (the \u201cwebsite\u201d) and LitCharts mobile applications (the \"apps\") are operated by LitCharts LLC (\u201cLitCharts\u201d).\nAll of the Terms of Service explained herein that refer to the website or \"Service\" apply equally to the use of our mobile apps.</p>\n<p>The Terms of Service set forth below are binding on all users of this website and of LitCharts mobile apps.\nBy directing your browser to this website or otherwise accessing the pages of this website or any LitCharts apps, you accept these Terms of Service.\nLitCharts may change the Terms of Service, or may modify or discontinue the website or services offered thereon, at any time at its sole discretion.\nLitCharts reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to deny further or continuing access to the website or Service to any visitor, including, without limitation, any user that LitCharts determines has violated any aspect of these Terms of Service.\nLitCharts reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to seek and obtain any other remedies available to it pursuant to any applicable laws and regulations as a result of your breach of these Terms of Service or any other act or omission by you that gives rise to a claim by LitCharts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>PLEASE BE ADVISED: These terms contain provisions that govern how claims that you and LitCharts have against each other can be brought.\nThese provisions will, with limited exception, require that you submit claims you have against LitCharts to binding and final arbitration on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, group or representative action or proceeding.</strong>\n</p>\nUsers Under Age 16\n<p>We do not permit anyone under age 16 to register for a free user account or a \"LitCharts A+\" paid membership subscription account.\nWe do not collect any data or other personally identifiable information from anyone under age 16.\nParents and legal guardians using the website and/or purchasing a subscription on behalf of a child are enitrely responsible for their child\u2019s use of the website, including all fees and legal liability that they incur.</p>\nFree Registered User Accounts\n<p>LitCharts users can create free registered user accounts to access certain features available to logged in free registered users.\nLitCharts free registered user accounts are distinct from paid \"LitCharts A+\" membership subscription accounts, which give users access to paid premium subscribers-only content.</p>\nA+ Membership Subscription and Other Paid Features\n<p>Access to much of LitCharts is free, but if you would like to upgrade to a paid LitCharts A+ membership subscription or any other paid features (the \"Service\"), the following terms apply.</p>\nBilling and Payment\n<p>LitCharts bills you through an online account for use of the Service.\nYou agree to pay LitCharts all charges associated with your paid subscription using this online account.\nYou agree to maintain current, complete, and accurate information for your billing account at any time you have a subscription.\nIn addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for you credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer.\nLitCharts may change the membership subscription price from time to time, such as by offering coupons for promotional purposes, at its sole discretion, but will notify you by email in the event of a price increase before your subscription renews.</p>\nAutomatic Renewal\n<p>(1) Your subscription for the Service will continue indefinitely until you cancel it via your Account Settings page.\nAfter your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period.\nYou agree that your account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature.\nIn the event of a price increase, we will notify you before your subscription automatically renews.\nIf you do not wish for your account to renew automatically you can cancel your account at any time.\nFor step-by-step guidelines on how to cancel, please see our Help Center.</p>\n<p>(2) By subscribing, you authorize LitCharts to charge your credit card, debit card or other payment method when your subscription begins.\nYour payment method will be charged automatically again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period, including any sales or similar taxes imposed on your subscription payments.\nUpon the renewal of your subscription, if LitCharts does not receive payment, you agree that LitCharts may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your payment method provider until payment is received or you cancel your subscription.\nUpon receipt of payment, your account will be reactivated and will continue to be charged automatically for each renewal period until you cancel.</p>\nCancellation Policy\n<p>\n<em>Cancellation by You.</em> You can cancel your LitCharts A+ subscription at any time at least 24 hours before the next subscription renewal date by going to the \u201cSubscription\u201d tab in your Account Settings, as outlined in our Help Center.\nIf you cancel your subscription, we will not bill you again at the end of your current subscription period.\nYou will have continued access to LitCharts A+ until the end of your then-current subscription term and your subscription will not renew thereafter.</p>\n<p>As stated in the Refund Policy below, LitCharts A+ subscription fees are generally not refundable.\nThis means LitCharts will not issue a refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for your then-current subscription period.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Termination by LitCharts.</em> LitCharts is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your LitCharts A+ subscription or your account, for any reason, in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms of Service.\nLitCharts has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of these Terms.\nIf you violate our Terms of Service and we terminate your account, you will no longer have access to your account and you will not be eligible for a refund under any circumstances.</p>\nRefund Policy\n<p>LitCharts A+ subscription fees are generally not refundable.\nWe may choose to offer a refund, on a case-by-case basis, and at our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>LitCharts explicitly does not offer refunds in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a user discovers that LitCharts does not cover the material they need or expected to find on our service.\nSince much of our content is available to preview for free, users must make this judgement for themselves before subscribing.\nIf you are unsure whether or not our subscribers-only content will meet your needs, please download a free sample prior to subscribing.</li>\n<li>If a user has logged in, even if only once, after subscribing to LitCharts A+.\nAs a subscriber, you have access to all of our premium subscribers-only content immediately.\nMuch like a Netflix or Spotify subscription, a LitCharts A+ subscription covers access to our content, regardless of how often or whether you use it.</li>\n<li>If a user forgets to cancel prior to renewal.\nSubscribers have complete control over initiating, cancelling, and reactivating subscriptions.\nThis means that as a subscriber, you can easily:</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Cancel your subscription at any time at least 24 hours before the next subscription renewal date.\nHere\u2019s how to cancel your subscription.</li>\n<li>Resubscribe at any time in the future.\nHere\u2019s how to reactivate your subscription.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>If a user subscribes under any false or fraudulent pretenses.\nLitCharts user accounts are licensed to one user per account.\nFailure to comply with this, or any other clause in our Terms of Service, precludes the user from the possibility of a refund.</li>\n<li>If a user has deleted his or her account.\nWe are unable to offer refunds, under any circumstances, for any accounts which have been deleted.\nSubscribers acknowledge that they are ineligible for refunds for any unused portion of their subscription upon deleting their account.</li>\n</ul>\nFraud\n<p>If you believe your financial information has been used fraudulently, please contact support@litcharts.com for assistance.</p>\nDisputes and Chargebacks\n<p>If you file a dispute for a LitCharts transaction with your financial institution, your account will be immediately closed and you will be banned from subscribing again.\nIf you have a concern about billing, you are encouraged to reach out to support@litcharts.com prior to filing a dispute.\nOnce a dispute has been filed with your financial institution, we are unable to assist with any billing questions or offer you a courtesy refund.\nYour account will immediately be terminated and banned and this action is irreversible.\nNo refunds will be provided for accounts that have filed a chargeback or dispute.</p>\nPrivacy\n<p>All information submitted on the website might potentially be publicly accessible.\nWe are not responsible for protecting, nor are we liable for failing to protect, the privacy of electronic mail or other information transferred through the Internet or any other network that you may utilize.\nPlease refer to our Privacy Policy for more information regarding
