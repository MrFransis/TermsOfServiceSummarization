accept that any reference on the Platform or the Services to \u201cverified\u201d information, or any similar term, means only that a Member has successfully passed the verification procedure existing

truthfulness of all information contained in your Advert, and you undertake to fulfil the Trip under the conditions described in your Advert.</p>\n<p>Providing your Advert complies with the T&amp;Cs, it will be posted on the Platform and therefore visible to Members and all visitors, even non-members, conducting a search on the Platform or on the website of BlaBlaCar\u2019s partners.\nBlaBlaCar reserves the right, at its sole discretion and without notice, to not post or to remove, at any time, any Advert that does not comply with the T&amp;Cs or that it considers as damaging to its image,

booking request.\nThis booking request is either (i) accepted automatically (if the Driver chose this option when posting his Advert), or (ii) accepted manually by the Driver.\nAt the time of the booking, the Passenger makes the online payment of the Cost Contribution and the related Service Fees, where applicable.\nAfter receipt of the payment by BlaBlaCar and validation of the booking request by the Driver, where applicable, the Passenger receives a booking confirmation (the \u201c<strong>Booking Confirmation</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>If you are a Driver and have chosen to handle manually the bookings requests when posting your Advert, you are required to respond to any booking request within the given timeframe.\nOtherwise, the booking request will expire automatically and the Passenger shall be refunded all sums paid at the time of the booking request, if any.</p>\n<p>At the time of the Booking Confirmation, BlaBlaCar will send you the telephone number of the Driver (if you are the Passenger) or of the Passenger (if you are the Driver).\nYou are then solely responsible for executing the contract binding you to the other Member.</p>\n<p>Any use of the Services, in the capacity of Passenger or Driver, relates to a specific name.\nThe Driver and the Passenger must correspond to the identity communicated to BlaBlaCar and the other Members participating in the Trip.</p>\n<p>However, BlaBlaCar allows its Members to book one or more Seats on behalf of a third party.\nIn this case, you undertake to accurately indicate to the Driver, at the time of the booking, the forenames, age and telephone number of the person on whose behalf you are reserving a Seat.\nIt is strictly prohibited to book a Seat for a minor under the age of 13 travelling alone.\nIn the case where you are reserving a seat for a minor over the age of 13 travelling alone, you undertake to request the prior agreement of the Driver and to provide him with duly completed and signed permission of his/her legal representatives.</p>\n<p>In addition, the Platform is intended for the booking of Seats for individuals.\nIt is forbidden to book a Seat for transporting any object, package, animal traveling alone or material items whatsoever.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is prohibited to publish an Advert for a Driver other than you.</p>\n<p>\n</p>4.3.&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\nBooking a bus

review about a Driver (if you are a Passenger) or about a Passenger (if you are a Driver) with whom you have shared a Trip or with whom you were supposed to share a Trip.\nHowever, you are not permitted to leave a review about another Passenger if you were a Passenger, or about a Member with whom you have not travelled or with whom you were not supposed to travel.</p>\n<p>Your review, and the review left by another Member about you, if any,, are only visible and published on the Platform after the shorter of the following periods: (i) immediately after you have both left a review, or (ii) after a period of 14 days following the first review..</p>\n<p>You have the option of responding to a review that another Member has left on your profile in a 14-day delay following the date of the review received.\nThe review and your response, where applicable, will be published on your profile.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.4.2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<strong>Moderation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You

these T&amp;Cs in the case where (i) you have received at least three reviews and (ii) the average review you have received is less than or equal to 3.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Financial conditions<p>\n</p>\n<p>Access to and registration on the Platform, as well as searching, viewing and posting Adverts, are free of charge.\nHowever, the booking is charged under the conditions described below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Cost Contribution when carpooling<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Cost Contribution is determined by you, as Driver, under your sole responsibility.\nIt is strictly prohibited to profit in any way from using our Platform.\nConsequently, you agree to limit the Cost Contribution you ask your Passengers to pay to the costs you actually incur to make the Trip.\nOtherwise, you alone will bear the risks of recharacterization of the transaction completed via the Platform.</p>\n<p>When you post an Advert, BlaBlaCar will suggest an amount of for the Cost Contribution, which notably takes account of the nature of the Trip and the distance travelled.\nThis amount is given purely as a guideline and it is up to you to increase it or reduce it to take account of the costs you actually incur on the Trip.\nTo avoid abuse, BlaBlaCar limits the possibility of adjustment of the Cost Contribution.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Service Fees<p>\n</p>\n<p>At the time of booking of a Trip or a bus ticket, BlaBlaCar may collect service fees (hereinafter referred to as the \u201cService Fees\u201d) calculated on the basis of the Cost Contribution or the price of the bus ticket.\nThe methods of calculation of the Service Fees in force can be found here and are for information purposes only.\nBlaBlaCar reserves the right to change the methods of calculation.\nAny modification does not affect the Service Fees of Trips and bus tickets already booked.</p>\n<p>The Service Fees are collected by BlaBlaCar for each Seat subject of a booking by a Passenger.</p>\n<p>In the case of cross-border journeys, please note that the methods of calculation of the amount of the Service Fees and the applicable VAT vary according to the residence of the Passenger.</p>\n<p>When using the Platform for cross-border trips or out of the United Kingdom, the Service Fees may be charged by an affiliate company of BlaBlaCar operating the local platform.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Rounding<p>\n</p>\n<p>You recognise and accept that BlaBlaCar may, at its full discretion, round up or down the Service Fees and the Cost Contribution.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Methods of payment and repayment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Collection mandate</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In using the Platform as Driver for Trips, you confer on BlaBlaCar a collection mandate for the Cost Contribution in your name and on your behalf.</p>\n<p>Consequently, in the context of a Trip, and after manual or automatic acceptance of the booking, BlaBlaCar shall collect the whole of the sum paid by the Passenger (Service Fees and Cost Contribution).</p>\n<p>The Cost Contributions received by BlaBlaCar are deposited in an account dedicated to payment of the Drivers.</p>\n<p>You recognise and accept that none of the sums received by BlaBlaCar in the name and on behalf of the Driver gives entitlement to interest.\nYou agree to respond diligently to any request of BlaBlaCar, and more generally of any administrative or court authority competent particularly in the prevention or combating of money laundering.\nNotably, you agree to provide, on simple request, any useful evidence of address and/or identity.</p>\n<p>In the absence of response to these requests, BlaBlaCar may take any measure it deems appropriate, notably freezing of the sums paid and/or suspension of your Account and/or termination of these T&amp;Cs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.4.2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<strong>Payment of the Cost Contribution to the Driver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After the Trip, the Passengers shall have a period of 24 hours after the end of the Trip to submit a claim on the Trip to BlaBlaCar.\nIn the absence of claim of the Passengers within this period, BlaBlaCar shall consider the Trip confirmed.</p>\n<p>From the time of this express or tacit confirmation, you shall have, as Driver, a credit payable on your Account.\nThis credit corresponds to the total amount paid by the Passenger at the time of confirmation of the Booking reduced by the Service Fees, i.e.\nthe Cost Contribution paid by the Passenger.</p>\n<p>When the Trip is confirmed by the Passenger, you have the option, as a Driver, of giving instructions to BlaBlaCar to pay the money to your bank account (by entering your bank details in advance in your Account) or your PayPal account (by entering your PayPal email address in advance in your Account).</p>\n<p>The payment order in your name will be sent on the first working day after your request or, if you do not so request, the first working day after&nbsp;the provision of the sums in question to your profile (providing BlaBlaCar has your bank information).</p>\n<p>At the end of the applicable time limitation periods, any sum not claimed from BlaBlaCar shall be deemed to belong to BlaBlaCar.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.5 Price for bus tickets</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The price for a bus ticket is set by the Bus Operator offering the ticket.\nYou will pay the price to the Bus Operator via the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n</p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Non-commercial and non-business purpose of the Services and the Platform<p>\n</p>\n<p>You agree to use the Services and the Platform only to be put into contact, on a non-business and non-commercial basis, with people wishing to share a Trip with you.</p>\n<p>As Driver, you agree not to request a Cost Contribution higher than the costs you actually incur and that may generate a profit, being specified that in the context of a cost sharing, you have to bear as a Driver your own part of the costs induced by the Trip.\nYou are solely responsible for calculating the costs you incur for the Trip and for checking that the amount requested of your Passengers does not exceed the costs you actually incur (excluding your share of the costs).</p>\n<p>BlaBlaCar reserves the right to suspend your Account in the case where you use a chauffeur-driven or other business vehicle or taxi, or a company car, and due to this, generate a profit from the Platform.\nYou agree to provide to BlaBlaCar, on its simple request, a copy of your car registration certificate and/or any other document showing that you are authorised to use this vehicle on the Platform and are not drawing any profit therefrom.</p>\n<p>BlaBlaCar also reserves the right to suspend your Account, limit your access to the Services, or terminate these T&amp;Cs, in the case of activity by you on the Platform which, owing to the nature of the Trips offered, their frequency, the number of Passengers carried and the Cost Contribution requested, entails a situation of profit for you, or for any reason suggesting to BlaBlaCar that you are generating a profit on the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n</p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Cancellation policy<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Canellation of a Trip<p>\n</p>\n<p>Drivers and Passengers may cancel a Trip at any time and BlaBlaCar does not offer any guarantee, of any nature, in

Passenger cancels more than 24 hours before the planned departure time as mentioned in the Advert, the Passenger shall only be refunded the Cost Contribution.\nThe Service Fees are retained by
