App\nInventor to be a valuable tool for classroom learning.\nMIT also\nvalues the privacy of its users as explained in the MIT App Inventor\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nAs many states have now passed laws\nregarding the use of online platforms in the classroom, MIT App\nInventor has been asked to execute certain \u201caddenda\u201d to service\ncontracts in order to continue the use of MIT App Inventor for\nclassroom use.\nMIT App Inventor is unable to execute agreements of\nthese sort as it does not maintain contractual agreements with school\ndistricts as part of this service.\nInstead, MIT App Inventor is a\nfree, online tool available to anyone who registers for an account.\nIf you are seeking to use MIT App Inventor for classroom use, we have\ndeveloped a different version of the platform which does not collect\nor maintain any personally identifiable information (PII).\nThis\nversion is available at\nhttp://code.appinventor.mit.edu and\nmay be more appropriate for your use.\nIf you have any additional\nquestions, please contact us at appinventor@mit.edu.</p>\n<p>Effective Date: July 1, 2020</p> ", "created_at": "2021-06-19 11:40:41.542043",
