should you have any Claims against Buzzery, LLC.\nBy agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the \"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C.\nSections 1-16, as amended.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration.</strong> As an exception to binding arbitration, you and Buzzery, LLC both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis.\nBuzzery, LLC will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court.\nBinding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures.</strong> You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim

reside.\nIt may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Buzzery, LLC agree.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator.</strong> You agree that

subject(s) of the Claim.\nThe arbitrator shall be chosen from JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms of Use and Conditions of Purchase and this arbitration provision.\nThe arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration

and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Award.</strong> The arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law.\nThe arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it.\nAlthough Buzzery, LLC may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Buzzery, LLC agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.\nNothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator's ability to award remedies provided by applicable law.\nAny award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Enforceability.</strong> This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Buzzery, LLC, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer.\nIf the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply.\nIf a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims.\nThis provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Buzzery, LLC and shall not be modified except in writing by Buzzery, LLC.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Amendments.</strong> Buzzery, LLC reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time.\nYour continued use of any Buzzery, LLC Website,
