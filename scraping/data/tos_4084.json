vulnerabilities, such as sub-domain takeovers.\n</li>\n</ul> What to expect <p>After you have submitted your report, we will respond to your report within 5 working days and aim to triage your report within 10 working days.\nWe\u2019ll also aim to keep you informed of our progress.</p>\n<p>Priority for remediation is assessed by looking at the impact, severity and exploit complexity.\nVulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address.\nYou are welcome to enquire on the status but should avoid doing so more than once every 14 days.\nThis allows our teams to focus on the remediation.</p>\n<p>We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.</p>\n<p>Once your vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your report.\nWe\u2019d like to unify our guidance, so please do continue to coordinate public release

indicating that the services do not fully align with \u201cbest practice\u201d, for example missing security headers.\n</li>\n<li> Submit reports detailing TLS configuration weaknesses, for example \u201cweak\u201d cipher suite support or the presence of TLS1.0 support.\n</li>\n<li> Communicate any vulnerabilities or associated details other than by means described in the published security.txt.\n</li>\n<li> Social engineer, \u2018phish\u2019 or physically attack Cypaw's staff or infrastructure.\n</li>\n<li> Demand financial compensation in order to disclose any

redistribute or fail to properly secure data retrieved from the systems or services.\n</li>\n<li>Securely delete all data retrieved during your research as soon as it is no longer required or within 1 month of the vulnerability being resolved, whichever occurs first (or as otherwise required by data protection law).</li>\n</ul> Legalities <p>This policy is designed to be compatible with common
