the other Medium Parties for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, to the greater of $50.00 USD or the amount paid by you to use our Services.</strong>\n</p>Resolving Disputes.\nBinding Arbitration<p>We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case.\nBefore filing a claim against Medium, you agree to contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim by email at legal@medium.com or by certified mail addressed to A Medium Corporation, P.O.\nBox 602, San Francisco, CA 94104.\nThe notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number.\n(b) describe the nature and basis of the claim.\nand (c) set forth the specific relief sought.\nOur notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your online account and will contain the information described above.\nIf we can\u2019t resolve matters within thirty (30) days after any notice is sent, either party may initiate a formal proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Medium and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below.\nNo class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision.\nIn addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) <strong>No Representative Actions.\nYou and Medium agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Medium and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(b) <strong>Arbitration of Disputes.\n</strong>Except for small claims disputes in which you or Medium seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county where you reside or disputes in which you or Medium seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, <strong>you and Medium waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, \u201c<em>Disputes</em>\u201d) resolved in court</strong>.\nAll Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.\nArbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California unless you\u2019re a consumer, in which case you may elect to hold the arbitration in your county of residence.\nFor purposes of this section a \u201c<strong>\n<em>consumer</em>\n</strong>\u201d means a person using the Services for personal, family or household purposes.\nYou and Medium agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201c<strong>\n<em>JAMS Rules</em>\n</strong>\u201d).\nThe most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS website and are incorporated into these Terms by reference.\nYou either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>\n<p>(c) You and Medium agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this section will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1, <em>et seq</em>.\n(the \u201c<strong>\n<em>FAA</em>\n</strong>\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nAs limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.\nThe arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>\n<p>(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute.\nThe arbitrator, Medium, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.\nThe duty of confidentiality doesn\u2019t apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>\n<p>(e) You and Medium agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Medium will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.\nFor any arbitration initiated by Medium, Medium will pay all JAMS fees and costs.\nYou and Medium agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>\n<p>(f) <strong>Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose.\notherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Medium will not have the right to assert the claim.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(g) <strong>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this section by sending an email of your request to </strong>\n<strong>yourfriends@medium.com</strong>.\nIn order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.\nBy opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with the next section regarding \u201cGoverning Law and Venue.\u201d</p>\n<p>(h) If any portion of this section is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.\n(2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this section or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this section.\nand (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.\nFurther, if any part of this section is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this section will be enforceable.</p>\n<strong>Governing Law and Venue</strong>\n<p>These Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Medium will be governed by California law except for its conflict of law principles.\nAny dispute between the parties that\u2019s not subject to arbitration or can\u2019t be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in San Francisco, California.</p>\n<p>Some countries have laws that require agreements to be governed by the local laws of the consumer\u2019s country.\nThis paragraph doesn\u2019t override those laws.</p>Amendments<p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time.\nIf we make changes, we\u2019ll provide you with notice of them by sending an email to the email address associated with your account, offering an in-product notification, or updating the date at the top of these Terms.\nUnless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately, and your continued use of our Services after we provide such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using our Services.</p>Severability<p>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>Miscellaneous<p>Medium\u2019s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\nThese Terms, and the terms and policies listed in the Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You Section, reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, statements and understandings of the parties.\nThe section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nUse of the word \u201cincluding\u201d will be interpreted to mean \u201cincluding without limitation.\u201d Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.\nYou agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.</p>\n<strong>Other Terms and Policies that May Apply to You</strong>\n<p>- Medium Rules<br>- Partner Program Terms<br>-

information with our lawyers and other professional advisors where necessary to obtain advice or otherwise protect and manage our business interests.</li>\n<li>We may share personal information in connection with, or during negotiations concerning, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li>\n<li>Personal information is shared between and among Medium and our current and future parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.</li>\n<li>We share personal information with your consent or at your direction.</li>\n<li>We also share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</li>\n</ul>THIRD-PARTY EMBEDS<p>Medium does not host some of the content displayed on our Services.\nUsers have the ability to post content that is actually hosted by a third party, but is embedded in our pages (an <em>\u201c</em>\n<strong>\n<em>Embed</em>\n</strong>\n<em>\u201d</em>).\nWhen you interact with an Embed, it can send information about your interaction to the hosting third party just as if you were visiting the third party\u2019s site directly.\nFor example, when you load a Medium post page with a YouTube video Embed and watch the video, YouTube receives information about your activity, such as your IP address and how much of the video you watch.\nMedium does not control what information third parties collect through Embeds or what they do with the information.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through Embeds.\nThe privacy policy belonging to the third party hosting the Embed applies to any information the Embed collects, and we recommend you review that policy before interacting with the Embed.</p>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES<p>Medium is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations and service providers in the United States and other countries.\nTherefore, we and our service providers may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction.\nFor example, we transfer personal data to Amazon Web Services, one of our service providers that processes personal information for us in various data center locations across the globe, including those listed here.\nWe will take steps to ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.</p>YOUR CHOICESAccount Information<p>You may access, correct, delete and export your account information at any time by logging into the Services and navigating to the Settings page.\nPlease note that if you choose to delete your account, we may continue to retain certain information about you as required by law or for our legitimate business purposes.</p>Cookies<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.\nIf you prefer, you can usually adjust your browser settings to remove or reject browser cookies.\nPlease note that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p>Communications Preferences<p>You may opt out of receiving certain communications from us, such as digests, newsletters, and activity notifications, by following the instructions in those communications or through your account\u2019s Settings page.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you administrative emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p>Mobile Push Notifications<p>With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device.\nYou can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.</p>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act or

future, and (4) not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.\nYou may make these requests by emailing us at privacy@medium.com or by completing this webform.\nWe will verify a webform request by asking you to provide identifying information.\nWe will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the CCPA.<br>\n<br>If we receive your request from an authorized agent, we may ask for evidence that you have provided such agent with a power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid written authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your

copyright violation using this form.<p>This policy explains how Medium responds to allegations of the unauthorized use of copyrighted images, text, or links to allegedly infringing materials under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d).</p>\n<strong>The DMCA</strong>\n<p>Section 512 of the DMCA outlines the statutory requirements for formally reporting copyright infringement.\nIt also explains how to challenge a notification of claimed infringement by submitting a counter-notice.</p>\n<strong>Do You Have Rights in a Copyrighted Work?</strong>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure whether you own the copyright in a particular work, please consult an attorney before sending a copyright notice to us.\n(Unfortunately, Medium can\u2019t give you legal advice.)</p>\n<strong>How To File a DMCA Notice</strong>\n<p>To submit a notice of claimed copyright infringement, you will need to provide us with the following information:</p>\n<p>1.\nA physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice) of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf;</p>\n<p>2.\nIdentification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (e.g., a copy of or link to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed upon);</p>\n<p>3.\nIdentification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit Medium to locate the material on our website or services (e.g., a link to the infringing post);</p>\n<p>4.\nYour contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;</p>\n<p>5.\nA statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</p>\n<p>6.\nA statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>\n<p>You can report alleged copyright infringement by emailing the above information to copyright@medium.com.</p>\n<p>You can also mail a copyright notice to:</p>\n<p>Designated Copyright Agent<br>A Medium Corporation<br>P.O.\nBox 602<br>San Francisco, CA 94104\u20130602</p>\n<p>Under 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(f), you may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by us or our users, if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity is infringing.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing your rights, you should consult an attorney before sending us a copyright notification.</p>\n<strong>How Medium Processes the Claim</strong>\n<p>We process copyright notices in the order they are received.\nPlease note that submitting duplicate DMCA notifications may cause delayed processing.</p>\n<p>Medium\u2019s response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material.</p>\n<p>If we remove or restrict access to user content in response to a notice of alleged infringement, Medium will make a good-faith effort to contact the affected account holder and provide information concerning the removal or restriction of access, including a copy of the takedown notice, along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>\n<p>We will also forward a copy of the complaint to the Lumen database.</p>\n<p>Where appropriate, Medium may suspend and warn repeat violators, and in more serious cases, permanently terminate user accounts.</p>\n<strong>When You Receive a DMCA Notification</strong>\n<p>If you receive a DMCA notification, it means that the content described in the notice has been removed from Medium or access to the content on Medium has been restricted.\nPlease carefully read our notice to you, which includes information about the notification we received as well as instructions on how to file a counter-notice.</p>\n<strong>Filing a Counter-Notice</strong>\n<p>If you received a DMCA notification about your material and believe that material was misidentified or removed in error, you should file a counter-notice by following the instructions below.</p>\n<p>Re-posting material removed in response to a DMCA notification may result in permanent account suspension.\nIf you believe the content was removed in error, please file a counter-notice instead of re-posting the material.</p>\n<p>To submit a counter-notice, please provide us with the following information:</p>\n<p>1.\nA physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will suffice);</p>\n<p>2.\nIdentification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA notice will suffice);</p>\n<p>3.\nA statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\nand</p>\n<p>4.\nYour name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Medium may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the copyright notification or an agent of such person.</p>\n<p>To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email notification of the removal and include the above information in the body of your reply.</p>\n<strong>After You Submit a Counter-Notice</strong>\n<p>When we receive a valid counter-notice, we will promptly forward a copy to the person who filed the original notification.\nIf we don\u2019t receive notice within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.</p>\n<strong>Think Long and Hard Before Filing a DMCA Notification or Counter-Notice</strong>\n<p>Please think carefully before submitting a claim or counter-notice, especially if you aren\u2019t sure whether you are the actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder\u2019s behalf.\nThere are legal and financial penalties for fraudulent and/or bad-faith claims.\nPlease make sure you are the actual rights holder, or you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed in error, and that you understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.</p>\n<strong>Learn More</strong>\n<p>To learn more about the DMCA and 512, check out the following resources.</p>\n<p>United States Copyright Office</p>\n<p>Lumen</p>\n<p>Electronic Frontier

min read<p>Medium is built for privacy.\nOne key to our approach is that Medium doesn\u2019t make money from ads.\nSo we don\u2019t serve ads to you on Medium and we don\u2019t send your data to third parties for the purpose of targeting ads to you.\nThe tracking we do at Medium is to make our product work.\nMedium doesn\u2019t track you across the Internet.\nWe track only your interactions within the Medium network (Medium.com and custom domains hosted by Medium).</p>\n<p>One concrete way we commit to user privacy is by honoring Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) browser settings.\nThere\u2019s no consensus on how best to do this.\nBut, we have adopted an approach that we believe honors the fundamental pro-privacy aims of the DNT standard.\nTo that end, we follow the recommendation made by the World Wide Web Consortium (\u201cW3C\u201d).</p>\n<p>If you are browsing with DNT enabled, you can read Medium in the logged-out state and our analytics will not receive information about you.\nAlso, embeds within a page (such as a YouTube video) will not load without your actively clicking through a DNT overlay.\nBy doing this, we allow you to choose whether any data is sent to a third-party embed before it is sent.\nIf you click into an embed while browsing DNT, it may cause data to be sent to the third-party hosting the embed.\nAs allowed under the W3C\u2019s specification, we do some first-party tracking in order to make Medium work.\nSpecifically, this ensures you don\u2019t see the same posts every time you look at medium.com, allows our paywall to function, and enables you to read a set number of members-only articles per month without a membership.\nOur first-party tracking allows these kinds of content customizations.\nWe also send data to third-party service providers (as understood in W3C\u2019s specification) \u2014 companies that provide services that make Medium work, like Amazon Web Services.</p>\n<p>If you would like a more customized experience on Medium, you can choose to create an account and sign in to it.\nBut in order to make your account work, we need to log some actions you take, so that we can offer recommendations, build your reading list, and connect you with a network of other readers and writers.\nLike most websites, we use cookies to authenticate your account and organize this information.\nSo, when you use Medium in the logged-in state, we cannot comply with DNT.\nThey are mutually exclusive.</p>\n<p>A few more details about cookies and the mechanics of DNT.\nCookies are unique identifiers that an internet service attaches to your browser or mobile device in order to recognize you.\nIf you enable DNT in your browser, it sends us a header when you fetch a webpage, requesting that we do not track your movements online through cookies or other means.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you browse DNT or not, we do not track you across the Internet.\nAnd we don\u2019t change or disable the DNT setting in your browser.</p>\n<p>Our policy aims to honor DNT requests and help foster the privacy protective Internet the standard envisions, while also providing the personalized experience that is at the core of Medium\u2019s vision.\nWe\u2019re proud to be an early adopter of DNT and will keep working on our implementation of it.</p>\n<p>For more details about the data we collect on users who are logged in or do not have DNT enabled, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>Medium Policy<p>The Fine Print</p>Follow<p>4.8K </p>\n<p>\n</p>18<p>\n</p>\n<p>Thanks to Sarah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.8K&nbsp;claps</p>\n<p>4.8K
