is Lighthouse16\u2019s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information that may be collected while operating the websites and apps, (taken together, the Service).\nThe Service is owned and operated by Lighthouse16.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Service does not ask you for personal information unless the Service truly need it.\nThe Service does not share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop the Service products, or protect the Service rights.\nThe Service does not store personal information on the Service servers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below is the Service's privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>Usage Analytics<p>All apps use Apple Analytics to collect information about the way you use them by default.\nThis data is always anonymised before it is sent to Apple Analytics, and cannot be used to personally identify you.\nThe Service look only for broad patterns in the aggregated usage data, such as whether or not a particular feature is frequently used, or whether users in general prefer one setting over another.\nThis helps the Service make informed decisions about the future development of it's apps.\nTo be clear the Service cannot track an individual user\u2019s behaviour.\nThe Service also cannot receive information from your device\u2019s displays, cameras, or microphones.</p>Crash Logs<p>If one of it's apps crashes while you are using it, data about the crash will be collected and sent to Apple Analytics to help identify the cause of the crash so that the Service can try to fix it in a future update.\nThese \u201ccrash logs\u201d contain information about the state of the app, operating system, and device at the time of the crash.\nNothing in the crash log can be used to personally identify you, and crash logs do not contain any of your private data.</p>Website Visitors<p>When you interact with the Service servers using a web browser, or indirectly by network requests sent on your behalf by it's apps, some metadata about the request may be logged by the Service.\nThis metadata may include parts of your IP address, the name of the resource requested, and the name and version number of the software making the request.</p>\n<p>The Service generally do not look at these logs unless a server appears to be being maliciously used or attacked in some way.\nThe Service may look at the information in aggregate to see statistics such as how many times the Service's apps have been downloaded, or from what sources network traffic is arriving.</p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<p>Certain visitors to the Service products choose to interact with the Service in ways that require the Service to gather personally-identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that the Service gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.</p>\n<p>In each case, the Service collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction with the Service.\nThe Service does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<p>Lighthouse16 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that need to know that information in order to process it on the Service behalf or to provide services available at the Service products.</li>\n<li>that have agreed not to disclose it to others.\nSome of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home country.\nby using the Service products, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.\nThe Service will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.\nOther than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Service discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when the Service believes that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Lighthouse16.</p>\n<p>The Service takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorised access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>Services used<p>In addition to the websites/apps the Service provide directly.\nThe Service also use third party service providers (collectively referred to as \u201cThird Party Services\u201d) who operate their own Privacy Policies.\nThe Third Party Services used by the Service deem important to the Service effective operation.</p>\n<p>So you can find out more about the services the Service use, and in turn those you may use whilst using and interacting with the Service.\nThe Service have compiled a list for your reference.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Services</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apple Analytics, Collection and aggregation of usage analytics and crash logs.\n(if enabled by user)</li>\n<li>Apple iCloud, Storage of your data entered in the Service's apps (if enabled by user)</li>\n<li>Fastmail, when you email to Lighthouse16 your email will be stored on servers from Fastmail.\n(user initiated)</li>\n</ul>Data Storage<p>\n<strong>Application Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All application data (that is the data you create and add to the Service's apps) is only stored locally on your devices and, if enabled, on iCloud.\nThe Service has no way to access application data and therefore cannot read, recover or share data for or on behalf of any person or organisation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data the Service collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Information about you may be transferred to, or accessed by, entities located around the world as described in this Policy.\nSome of these entities may be located in countries that do not provide an equivalent level of protection as your home country.\nBy using the Service, and providing the Service information about you, you consent to the international transfer of information about you to the above parties.</p>Data Protection<p>We take reasonable measures to protect any personal information the Service may hold about you in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\nHowever, despite the Service efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>\n<p>Sensitive information sent between your browser and the Service's website, and your device and Third Party Services, is transferred in encrypted form using Secure Socket Layer (\"SSL\").\nWhen transmitting sensitive information, you should always make sure that your browser can validate the SSL certificate.</p>\n<p>For information on how your device encrypts and secures application data please see

Service.</p>\n<p>Application Data \u2014 If you no longer want to use the Service and would like to delete all associated Application Data then delete the application from your device and any application data stored in iCloud.\nAs the Service do not have access to your application data, the Service cannot do this for you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Access and Correction</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you believe the Service is storing information that you would like access to or information corrected, please contact me.</p>Children<p>The Service are not for use by children under 13 and the Service do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.\nIf the Service learn that the Service have collected personal information of a child under 13, the Service will delete such information.</p>Business Transfers<p>If the Service, or substantially all of its assets, the Service are acquired, or in the unlikely event that the Service goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of the Service may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>Privacy Policy Changes<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, the Service may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in the Service\u2019s sole discretion.\nLighthouse16 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.</p>Questions?<p>Please contact me if you have any questions about the Service's data collection or privacy policies.\nI will be more than happy to discuss them with you.</p>\n<p>Last update: <strong>2021-05-20</strong>\n</p>\u00a9 2016-2022 Lighthouse16All Rights
