13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.\nIf you believe that we might have any personal information from a child under 13, please contact us at: www.tanga.com/support.</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Types of Data We Collect.</b> We collect personal information from users, as described below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(a) Information You Provide to Us.</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect personal information from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail, phone number, username and password when you create an account to log in to our Services (\u201c<b>Account</b>\u201d).</li>\n<li>We will collect payment information necessary to complete transactions, including your name, credit card information, shipping information and billing information.</li>\n<li>We collect your birthdate in order to send you special offers and customized product recommendations on your birthday.</li>\n<li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</li>\n<li>If you sign up for our newsletter we will collect

contest or other promotion on our Services, we may ask you for your e-mail address and/or home number (to notify you if you win or not).\nWe may also ask for first and last name, and sometimes postal address to verify your identity.\nIn some situations, we may need additional information as a part of the entry process, such as a prize selection choice.\nThese sweepstakes and contests are voluntary.\nWe recommend that you read the rules for each sweepstakes and contest that you enter.</li>\n<li>We also collect personal information at other points in our Services that state that personal information is being collected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>(b) Information Collected via Technology.</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Log Files.</u> As is true of most websites and mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.\nThis information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (\u201c<b>ISP</b>\u201d), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nWe use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users\u2019 movements around the Site or Application, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users\u2019 needs.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Mobile Services.</u> We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded any of our Applications.\nFor example, in the event our Applications crash on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Applications.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Cookies.</u> Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.\n\u201c<b>Cookies</b>\u201d are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer\u2019s hard drive while you are viewing the Site.\nWe may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Services.\nThis type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to you, to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs, and to deliver advertising tailored to your interests.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Pixel Tags.</u> In addition, we use \u201c<b>Pixel Tags</b>\u201d (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).\nPixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies that are used to track online movements of Web users.\nIn contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.\nPixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Collection of Data by Advertisers.</u> We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Services.\nCertain third parties may automatically collect information about your access to our Services, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number).\nThey do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies.\nInformation collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Services and the other sites tracked by these third parties.\nThis policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Traffic Analytics.</u> We use a number of third party service providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyze how users use the Services

what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site.\nWe use the information we get from these Analytics Companies to improve our Site, Applications and Services.\nThese Analytics Companies collect the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information.\nWe do not combine the information generated through the use of our Analytics Companies with your personal information.\nAlthough these Analytics Companies may place a persistent Cookie on your web browser or mobile device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Services, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but the Analytics Company that placed the applicable Cookie.\nThis Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for the Cookies
