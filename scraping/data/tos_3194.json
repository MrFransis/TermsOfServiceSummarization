the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nand</li>\n<li>certification of deletion of Personal Data as described in Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided upon Customer\u2019s request;&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Standard Contractual Clauses (or obligations the same as those under the Standard Contractual Clauses) will not apply to the

other written means.&nbsp.\nIf Customer objects to such engagement in a written notice to Qualified within 15 days after being informed of the engagement on reasonable grounds relating to the protection of Personal Data, Customer and Qualified will work together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution to address such objection.\nIf the parties are unable to reach a mutually acceptable resolution within a reasonable timeframe, Customer may, as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate the Agreement and cancel the Service by providing written notice to Qualified.</p>6.\n&nbsp;Miscellaneous<p>The total combined liability of Qualified, whether in contract, tort or any other theory of liability, under or in connection with Agreement, this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Annex 1, Section 4 (Transfers out of the EEA) combined will be limited to limitations on liability or other liability caps agreed to by the parties in the
