Client.\n(b) failures, errors or defects in the facilities, hardware, software or network of Client.\nor (c) circumstances that constitute a force majeure event or that are beyond Podium\u2019s reasonable control, the Services will be available for access via the Website 99.0% of the time during of the applicable Subscription Term.\nClient\u2019s sole remedy and Podium\u2019s sole liability for failure to meet the aforementioned availability shall be support in accordance with Section 6.2.\n</p>\n<p> 6.2.\n<u>Support.</u> Podium makes available web-based support through the Website.\nAdditional support services may be available to Client subject to payment of applicable fees (if any), as specified in any applicable Subscription Documentation.\nAny support services are subject to this Agreement and Podium\u2019s applicable support policies.\nPodium may also provide onboarding, deployment and other services under this Agreement.\nThe scope, pricing and other terms

cooperation and the accuracy and completeness of any information from Client needed to deliver the Services.\n</p>\n<p>7.\n<b>FEES AND PAYMENT.</b>\n</p>\n<p> 7.1.\n<u>Fees.</u> Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Services are provided on an ongoing, per license subscription-basis including automatically recurring payments for periodic charges, according to the terms and conditions referenced in the Subscription Documentation (\"<b>Subscription</b>\").\nClient agrees to pay to Podium the fees for the Subscription to the Services or any Bundle (\"<b>Subscription Fees</b>\") and any additional fees (if applicable), all as set forth in the applicable Subscription Documentation (collectively, the \"<b>Fees</b>\").\nExcept as otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription documentation, unless Client terminates a Free Access Subscription prior to the lapse of the Free Access Subscription term, such Services will convert to a paid Subscription and Client agrees to pay Podium the applicable Subscription Fees according to the terms of this Agreement.\nUnless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, payment for all Fees is due within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.\n</p>\n<p> 7.2.\n<u>Payment of Fees.</u> Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Subscription Documentation, all Subscription Fees will be paid annually in advance, though overage fees (if any) may be charged in arrears, and all references to currency set forth herein will mean U.S.\ndollars, with all payments hereunder to be made in U.S.\ndollars.\nSubscription Fees are non-refundable and non-creditable, except as expressly set forth in Sections 2.3 (Modification of the Services) and 8.3 (Termination for Cause).\nIf the payment method selected on the applicable Subscription Documentation is credit card, ACH, or direct debit, Client authorizes Podium to charge the Subscription Fees automatically, on an auto-renew basis on your Subscription Start Date (as defined below) for each subsequent Subscription Term.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, all additional Subscription Fees for additional Services accessed by Client will be billed when the Service is first accessed by Client and automatically, on an auto-review basis on Client\u2019s existing Subscription Start Date.\nThe Subscription will continue unless and until you or Podium terminate your Subscription in accordance with Section 8.\nYou must cancel your Subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fees to your account.\nIf Client elects to pay by credit card, then you are responsible for both (a) enabling auto-recharge on your account and (b) ensuring that your account has a sufficient positive balance to cover all Fees when due.\nShould Podium be unable to process/receive the Fees when due and owing, payment shall be considered overdue.\nPodium shall have the right to charge interest on all overdue amounts at the annual rate of 12%, compounded monthly, or the maximum lawful amounts, whichever is less.\nAdditionally, after payment becomes overdue, Podium shall have the right to immediately suspend Client\u2019s access to the Services and/or seek to enforce Client\u2019s payment obligations including through the use of third-party services.\n</p>\n<p> 7.3.\n<u>Taxes.</u> Podium\u2019s Fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Client must pay any applicable taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Podium.\nClient will make tax payments to Podium to the extent amounts are included on Podium\u2019s invoices.\n</p>\n<p> 7.4.\n<u>Annual Fee Increase.</u> Podium reserves the right to increase Fees for any Services, upon sixty (60) days\u2019 prior written notice, effective on the start date of your subsequent Subscription Term.\n</p>\n<p>8.\n<b>TERM AND TERMINATION.</b>\n</p>\n<p> 8.1.\n<u>Term.</u> This Agreement is effective until the applicable Subscription Term for the Services has expired or the Subscription is terminated as expressly permitted herein.\nUnless otherwise stated in Client\u2019s Subscription Documentation, the initial term for any Subscription to the Services is twelve (12) months and will automatically renew for subsequent periods of equal duration (the \"<b>Subscription Term</b>\"), unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current Subscription Term.\nClient may give notice of non-renewal by sending an email to support@podium.com.\nIf no Subscription start date is specified on the applicable Subscription Documentation, the Subscription starts when Client first obtains access to the Services (\"<b>Subscription Start Date</b>\").\nBy agreeing to any Subscription Documentation, Client is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Subscription Term.\nClient cannot cancel or terminate a Subscription Term except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause).\n</p>\n<p> 8.2.\n<u>Suspension of Services</u>.\nPodium may suspend Client\u2019s access to the Services if: (a) Client\u2019s account is overdue or (b) Client has exceeded its Scope of Use limits.\nPodium may also suspend Client\u2019s access to the Services, remove Client Data or disable Third-Party Products if it determines that: (i) Client has breached Sections 3 (Use Rights.\nRestrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations).\nor (ii) suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other Clients or third parties or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services.\nPodium will have no liability for taking action as permitted above.\nFor avoidance of doubt, Client will remain responsible for payment of Fees during any suspension period.\nUnless this Agreement has been terminated, Podium will cooperate with Client to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Client has resolved the condition requiring suspension.\n</p>\n<p> 8.3.\n<u>Termination for Cause</u>.\nEither party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Subscription Documentation, if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach.\n(b) ceases operation without a successor.\nor (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).\nIf Client terminates during the Subscription Term for any reason other than the foregoing, Client will be responsible for the Fees due for the entire Subscription Term.\nPodium may also terminate this Agreement or any related Subscription Documentation immediately if Client breaches Sections 3 (Use Rights.\nRestrictions) or 5 (Client Obligations), for repeated violations of other Sections of this Agreement, or if applicable, a breach of the parties\u2019 BAA.\n</p>\n<p> 8.4.\n<u>Effect of Termination</u>.\nUpon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or any Subscription Documentation: (a) Client\u2019s license rights will terminate and it must immediately cease use of the Services (including any related Podium Technology) and delete (or, at Podium\u2019s request, return) any and all copies of any Podium documentation, scripts, passwords or access codes

otherwise precluded by a BAA, Podium may delete any such data in its possession at any time.\nIf Podium terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 8.3 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Subscription Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Client.\nExcept where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this

request, but Podium may participate in any claim through counsel of its own choosing and the parties will reasonably cooperate on any defense.\nIn the event Podium assumes exclusive defense of such claims, Client agrees to cooperate with our defense of any such claims.\nClient must not settle any claim without Podium\u2019s prior written consent if the settlement does not fully release Podium from liability or would require Podium to admit fault, pay any amounts or take or refrain from taking any action.\n</p>\n<p> 12.2.\n<u>Indemnification by Podium.</u> Podium will indemnify and hold
