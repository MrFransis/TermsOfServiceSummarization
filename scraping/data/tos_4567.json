the hCaptcha anti-bot service (hereinafter \"hCaptcha\") on our website.\nThis service is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation (\"IMI\").\nhCaptcha is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program.\nTo do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics.\nThis analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled.</p>\n<p>When using the Revolt App, hCaptcha will only begin analysis when you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Submit a login request.</li>\n<li>Submit a registration request.</li>\n<li>Submit a password reset / email resend request.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the analysis, hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g.\nIP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user).\nThe

protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam.\nIMI acts as a \"data processor\" acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a \"service provider\" for the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nFor more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/ and
