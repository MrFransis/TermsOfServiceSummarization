provide</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are just browsing the Phone2Action website, we do not ask you to enter any personal information about yourself unless you complete a Company form.\nIf you wish to take action in any campaigns powered by our technology, the personal information that you provide can include your name, title, physical address (including zip code), email address, and phone number.\nWe also collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of our Platform, which may include photos, your personal comments and positions on topics, which could include political information and other information of a sensitive nature that you choose to submit.\nWe may also collect your user name, or handle, from Facebook or Twitter when you connect to us from them or wish to connect to them from us.\nWe may also combine information you provide with Personal Data we collect automatically (as further described in Part I, Section B below) and with Data we receive from third-parties.\nWe may also associate information you provide with information we collect about you from different devices, browsers and platforms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>B.\nInformation collected automatically</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Certain information that identifies you may be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers\u2019 server logs, including your Internet Protocol (\u201c<strong>IP</strong>\u201d) address, browser type, operating system and information regarding what website pages you accessed and when.\nAn IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.\nIn some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session.\nbut if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address may vary from session to session.\nWe also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (\u201c<strong>URL</strong>\u201d) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit to our website or access to our Platform through a campaign, and the information for which you searched and viewed.\nThis type of information is collected to make our Services more useful to you and our Clients, and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>Cookies</strong>\u201d are small pieces of information that a website sends to your devices while you are viewing a website.\nWe may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a better experience with our Platform.\nPersistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser directions.\nIf you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of our Services may perform differently, for instance, you will need to re-enter your information each time you return to use the Services.</p>\n<p>We do not offer third-party advertising on our website, therefore we do not respond to \u201cdo not track signals\u201d or other mechanisms that might enable website visitors to opt out of tracking on the Phone2Action site.<br>\n<br>By using our website and agreeing to this policy, <strong>you consent to our use of cookies</strong> in accordance with the terms of this policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>C.\nInformation collected from third-parties</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the information that we collect as described above, we also collect information about you from our third-party integrators and vendors.\nThese parties are used by us to run our Platform and integrate our Services with our Clients, so that you can take action and participate in campaigns through our Platform.\nThe information that we collect through these channels includes your geo location data, derived from the address that you submit, legislative data, such as your legislative or political district, candidate and elected official information, voter registration and polling location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>II.\nHow we collect your information</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect your Personal Data in a number of ways, and this section will describe those methods.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>A.\nYour direct interaction with us</em>\n</strong>: We collect your Personal Data when you interact directly with us by coming to our website to browse or to enter information in a campaign that uses our Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>B.\nFrom our Clients</em>\n</strong>: Another way we collect your Personal Data is from our Clients who contract with us to use Phone2Action services.\nIf you provide your information via a campaign that uses our Platform, we will collect the information you provide on the form such as name, e-mail address and the full content of your message, including attached files, and other information you provide.\nThis method of Personal Data submission to us could occur <strong>(i)</strong>, for instance if you complete a form created by a client but powered by Phone2Action, or <strong>(ii)</strong> where the Client captures the Data you enter and then transmits that Data to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>C.\nFrom Third-Party Technologies and Social Network Sites</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources with which you have interacted, such as through third-party technologies that are integrated into the Services like Alexa, which is owned by Amazon, or through social networks like Facebook or Twitter when you grant us permission to access these technologies to further use Phone2Action Services.\nFurther, we may associate this Personal Data obtained from these sources with the other Personal Data we have collected about you from other sources as described in this Notice.\nWe do not control or supervise how these third-parties process your Personal Data, and any information request that you have regarding the disclosure of your Personal Data from them to us should be made directly to those third-parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>D.\nThird-party analytics</em>: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third-parties who provide us with analytics services for our Platform and Services may collect some of the information described in Section I, including, for example, IP address, access times, browser type and language, device type, device identifiers and Wi-Fi information.\nFor instance, we use Google Analytics and similar services to perform certain analytical tasks about our web user\u2019s activities.\nWe use the User-ID feature of Google Analytics to combine behavioral information across devices and sessions (including authenticated and unauthenticated sessions).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>III.&nbsp;<u>How we use your information and the Legal Basis for sharing it</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use your information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Process information you have submitted on a form either through one of our Client\u2019s campaign forms on a Phone2Action website form.\nvia text message, voice recognition, conversational messaging system, or via phone call.</li>\n<li>Seek your views or comments on the Services we provide;</li>\n<li>Send you marketing materials and information about other Phone2Action products with your consent;</li>\n<li>Carry out our obligations arising from our website\u2019s terms of use, or arising from any contracts entered into by us with our Clients;</li>\n<li>Provide, create and maintain a trusted and safer environment and comply with our legal obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applicable laws require us to have a \u201clegal basis\u201d for using and sharing your information.\nThese legal bases include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your consent \u2013 to fulfill your express requests.</li>\n<li>To carry out our legitimate interests in our Platform.\n\u201cLegitimate interests\u201d is a concept in data protection law which essentially means we have a good and fair reason to use your Personal Data and we do so only if our interests are not overridden by your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nWe sometimes require your Data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that might reasonably be expected as part of running our business and that does not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.</li>\n<li>To fulfill our obligations with you when the processing is necessary to perform a contract with you, like the Terms of Service.</li>\n<li>To measure the adequate performance of our interactions with you, and to comply with applicable laws.</li>\n<li>To promote the safety and security of the Services, our users, and other parties.\nFor example, we may use the information to protect against fraud and abuse, respond to a legal request or claim, conduct audits, and enforce our terms and policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>IV.\nHow we share your information</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\n<em>With</em> y<em>our consent</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where you have provided express and unambiguous consent, we share your Personal Data as described at the time of consent.\nThis form of consent is also given when you take action on a client campaign or when you sign a petition.\nWe do not otherwise share any of your Personal Data that identifies you, except as instructed by you.</p>\n<p>The specific ways in which you consent to share Personal Data that you provide to us is when we enable you to send individual e-mails and related messages to lawmakers, regulatory agencies, and other organizations and leaders that are the target of a campaign through our Platform.\nThese messages may include your full name, e-mail address, mailing address and other contact information you may have provided as part of the submission.\nYou are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you send using our Services.</p>\n<p>For certain campaigns that you completed some of your information may be made public, including without limitation your name, city, and state (\u201cPublic Petition Information\u201d).\nAll other information you have been asked to provide will not be made public.</p>\n<p>Based on our legitimate interest to operate and promote our Platform we may display parts of the Platform (e.g., a campaign web form and your postings on it) on sites operated by our Clients, using technologies such as widgets or via APIs.\nIf your postings are displayed on a Client\u2019s site, information from your posting may also be displayed.</p>\n<p>Information you share publicly through our Platform may be indexed through third party search engines, such as Google or Bing.\nWe do not control the practices of third party search engines, and they may use caches containing your outdated information.\nYou acknowledge that Personal Data that you submit when you take action on our Platform through our website or Services may be available, via the internet, around the world.\nWe cannot prevent the use (or misuse) of such Personal Data by others.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>B.\nThird-Party Sub-Processors</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use third-party Sub-Processors (including contractors and service providers) to provide the Services and to help with our operations, which may require that these Sub-Processors have access to and use your Personal Data.\nFor example, we may use a third-party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or SMS) to provide customer support, to receive additional Data about you, and to perform analytics and other work that we may need to outsource.\nThe Sub-Processors are bound by law and/or contract to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Data, and to only process your Personal Data to provide requested services and only act on our documented instructions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>C.\nThird-Party websites</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide links to other websites, such as social network sites (Facebook, Twitter) and other websites may provide links to our website.\nThird-party websites operate according to their own terms of use and privacy policies.\nPhone2Action has no control over such third-party websites, and <strong>by using our Platform and Services, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of such third-party sites, and do not endorse and are not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that Phone2Action will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>D.&nbsp;De-identified information about you</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information (i.e., information that does not personally identify you directly), or statistical information about you, including statistical data and historical use data, with others for a variety of purposes, including for their own uses, for example, for improving their services for you and others, or for educational purposes.\nYour Personal Data will not be shared on an individual, identifiable basis under these circumstances, nor can you ask us to restrict this type of sharing, since it does not identify you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>E.\nAs required by law or legitimate business interest</em>: </strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition, we may disclose your Personal Data where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.\nLikewise, we may disclose your Personal Data to our professional advisers as reasonably necessary for the purposes of managing risks, obtaining professional advice, or the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure.\nAlso, we may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger or similar transaction involving sale or transfer of some or all of our business or assets.\nIf another company acquires our company or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>V.\nWe disclose your Personal Data internationally</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;A.&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>\n<em>Our

contract with you.\n(iii) to conclude or perform a contract with another person in the furtherance of your or our legal interests (such as with a Client).\n(iv) or to fulfill a compelling legitimate

consistent with your relationship with Phone2Action and the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>B.\nThird-Parties</em>:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While many of our third party Sub-Processors are global companies with operations in the EEA, Some of the third-party Sub-Processors with whom we share Personal Data are located outside of the EEA.\nCertain third countries have

herein.\nWe will do our best to address your concerns and we will attempt to resolve any disputes with you amicably.\nExcept as provided herein, you and the Company agree that we will resolve any

arising between you and the Company relating to the Services or this Agreement (each a \u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of JAMS (\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d).\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall select an alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201c<strong>ADR Provider</strong>\u201d) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration.\nThe arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nFor any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the JAMS (or ADR Provider, as applicable), you and the Company must abide by the following rules:&nbsp;(a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions.\nand (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.\nIf the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS rules (or ADR Provider rules, as applicable), and the parties will attempt to agree on a mutually convenient location for the hearing.\nIf the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing within thirty (30) days of their initial discussion, the hearing will take place in Arlington, Virginia.\nIf you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Company will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator\u2019s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive.\nIn the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies.\nYou and the Company also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court.\nIn addition, you and the Company retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Agreement, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Agreement.\nNeither you nor the Company may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim.\nClaims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis.\nThe arbitrator can decide only your and/or the Company\u2019s individual Claims.\nThe arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.\nIf any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nNo waiver of any provision of this Arbitration Agreement will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement.\nSuch a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with the Company.\n<strong>THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN JAMS RULES OR THE RULES OF THE ADR PROVIDER.</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>30-Day Right to Opt

parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We may, in our discretion and without liability to you, with or without cause, with or without prior notice and at any time: (a) terminate this Agreement or your access
