"text": "\nGeneral Terms and Conditions\nScope and Validity of Contract\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>These conditions apply to all purchases of products and services which are sold through this website by us, the seller, Objective Development Software GmbH, Grosse Schiffgasse 1A/7, 1020 Wien, Austria, to you, the purchaser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>By placing an order on this site you agree to abide by these conditions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The terms and conditions of the buyer are invalid for the legal transaction which is the subject of this contract, as well as for the entirety of our business relations.\nAll offers are subject to change without notice.</li>\n</ol>\nPerformance and Inspection\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The subject of an order can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development of an organizational plan</li>\n<li>Macro- and micro-analyses</li>\n<li>Creation of custom-designed programs</li>\n<li>Delivery of library (standard) programs</li>\n<li>Acquisition of rights to use software products</li>\n<li>Acquisition of exclusive rights to use and to exploit software products</li>\n<li>Support at system start-up / support during system changeover</li>\n<li>Telephone advisory service</li>\n<li>Program maintenance</li>\n<li>Creation of program carriers</li>\n<li>Other services</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Individual organizational plans and programs shall be elaborated in line with the type and scope of the information, documents and accessory aids which have been made available in toto by the buyer.\nIncluded are customary test data as well as the opportunity to test to the necessary extent, which the buyer shall make available on a timely basis, during normal business hours, and at his expense.\nIf the buyer has already been working in real time in an operating system that is being made available for testing, the responsibility for securing the real data lies with the buyer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The basis for creating custom-designed programs shall be the written performance specifications that either are provided by the buyer or that the seller writes up, at charge to the buyer, on the basis of documentation and information provided to him by the buyer.\nThis performance catalogue is to be inspected by the buyer for correctness and completeness and is to be initialed by him as a sign of his assent.\nRequests for modifications which are made thereafter can result in separate deadline and price agreements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For individually created software or program adaptations, it is required that each program be accepted by the buyer at the latest four weeks after delivery by the seller.\nThis acceptance will be confirmed in a record of the transaction by the buyer (inspection for correctness and completeness in line with the performance specifications accepted by the seller on the basis of the test data made available to him, as described in 2.2).\nShould the buyer allow four weeks to pass without accepting the program, the delivered software shall be deemed to have been accepted as at the last day of the stated time period.\nIf the buyer uses the software in real-time operations, the software is thereby deemed to have been accepted by the buyer.\nPossible defects \u2013 deviations from the written performance specifications \u2013 are to be reported to the seller with sufficient supporting documentation.\nThe seller shall make efforts to correct the defects as quickly as possible.\nIf there are serious defects that have been reported in writing, i.e., if real-time operations have not commenced or cannot be continued, a renewed acceptance of the work following correction of the deficiency is required.\nThe buyer does not have the right to refuse software because of immaterial defects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When library (standard) programs have been ordered, the buyer confirms by virtue of the order his knowledge of the scope of performance of the ordered program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Should it prove in the course of the work to be impossible, actually or legally, to complete the order in line with the performance specifications, it is the responsibility of the seller immediately to inform the buyer thereof.\nIf the buyer does not change the performance specifications accordingly or create the conditions to make completion of the order possible, the seller can reject performance of the order.\nIf the impossibility of carrying out the order is due to an omission on the part of the buyer or to a later change by the buyer in the performance specifications, the seller is entitled to withdraw from the order.\nThe buyer is to reimburse the seller\u02bcs costs and fees that have come due for the work as well as any dismantling costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The shipment of program carriers, documentation, and performance specifications shall be at the expense and risk of the buyer.\nShould the buyer wish further training and elucidation, these will be billed separately.\nInsurance will be taken out only at the request of the buyer.</li>\n</ol>\nPrices, Taxes and Fees\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>All prices are in Euro and do not include sales tax.\nThey are valid only for the present order.\nThe quoted prices are ex business domicile or branch office of the seller.\nThe costs of program carriers (e.g., CDs, magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, floppy disks, streamer tapes, magnetic tape cassettes, etc.) as well as any contract fees shall be billed separately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For library (standard) programs the valid prices are the list prices in effect on the day of delivery.\nAll other services (organizational consultancy, programming, training, support during changeover, telephone advisory services) will be charged at the rates in effect on the day the services are performed.\nDeviations from the amount of time calculated as being required for the work (which serves as the basis for the price calculation) and for which the seller is not responsible, shall be charged according to the actual time spent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The costs for travel, per diem, and overnight accommodation costs shall be invoiced separately to the buyer according to the valid respective rates.\nTransit time is to be considered as work time.</li>\n</ol>\nDelivery Dates\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The seller is to endeavor to keep as closely as possible to the agreed dates for completion of the order.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The targeted completion dates can only then be met if 1) the buyer makes available to the seller in full, on the dates established by the seller, all the necessary preliminary work and documents, especially the performance specifications accepted by him in accordance with \u00a72, Item 3, and if 2) the buyer fulfills his obligation to cooperate to the extent required.\nDelays in delivery and cost increases that result from incorrect, incomplete, or subsequently changed data and information or supporting documentation provided to the seller, are not the responsibility of the seller and cannot result in the seller\u02bcs being in default of delivery.\nAdditional costs so arising are to be borne by the buyer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>In the case of orders that encompass a number of units or programs, the seller is entitled to make partial deliveries and to submit partial invoices.</li>\n</ol>\nPayment\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The invoices submitted by the seller, inclusive of sales tax, are payable at the latest 14 days from receipt of the invoice without any deductions and free of charges.\nFor partial invoices, the terms of payment for the entire order obtain analogously.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where orders encompass a number of units (e.g., computer programs and/or training sessions, completion in stages), the seller is entitled to submit an invoice after the delivery of each unit or service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment on the agreed-upon dates is an essential condition for delivery and for fulfillment of the contract by the seller.\nFailure on the part of the buyer to comply with the agreed payment schedule entitles the seller to discontinue current work and to withdraw from the contract.\nAll costs connected therewith as well as loss of profit are to be borne by the buyer.\nIn case of delayed payment, interest on payment in arrears will be charged at customary bank rates.\nIn case two consecutive installments are not paid on time, the seller has the right to enforce non-compliance and to call accepted drafts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The buyer is not entitled to withhold payment because of incomplete total delivery, guarantee or warranty claims, or complaints.</li>\n</ol>\nCopyright and Use\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The seller or his licensors are entitled to all copyrights on the agreed services (programs, documentation, etc.).\nThe buyer obtains only the right to use the software after payment of the agreed remuneration strictly for his own purposes, only with the hardware as specified in the contract, and, in accordance with the number of licenses acquired, simultaneously at different workplaces.\nBy this contract the buyer acquires merely the authorization to use the software.\nFurther distribution of the product by the buyer is not permitted, as per the copyright law.\nThe buyer does not by virtue of participating in the production of the software acquire any rights beyond its use as set forth in this contract.\nAny infringement of the copyrights of the seller will result in the right to claim damages, in which case the seller is entitled to full satisfaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The buyer is permitted to make copies for archival and data backup purposes only on condition that the software does not contain an express prohibition on the part of the licensor or a third party and that all notices of copyright and ownership are transferred unchanged into these copies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Should the disclosure of the interfaces be necessary to produce the interoperability of the software covered by this contract, the seller is to request this of the buyer with remuneration of costs.\nIf the seller does not comply with this stipulation and decompilation follows in accordance with copyright law, the results are to be used exclusively for the production of interoperability.\nMisuse will result in claims for damages.</li>\n</ol>\nRight of Cancellation\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Should the agreed-on date of a delivery be exceeded due solely to the fault or the unlawful conduct of the seller, the buyer is entitled to cancel the contract in question by registered letter if essential parts of the agreed service are not performed within a reasonable grace period and the buyer is in no way at fault.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Force majeure, work conflicts, natural catastrophes, and transportation stoppages, as well as other circumstances that cannot be influenced by the seller relieve the seller of the obligation to deliver or permit him to redetermine the agreed delivery period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Cancellation by the buyer is only possible with the written agreement of the seller.\nIf the seller agrees to the cancellation, he is entitled to charge not only for services rendered and accrued costs, but also a cancellation fee that represents 30% of the value of the total order not yet settled.</li>\n</ol>\nWarranty, Maintenance, Alterations\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Notices of defects are valid only if they concern defects that are reproducible and if they are submitted within 4 weeks after delivery of the agreed service or, in the case of custom-designed software, after acceptance of the program in accordance with \u00a72 Item 4, and documented in writing.\nIn fulfillment of the warranty, rectification of defects takes precedence over price reduction or rescission of the order.\nIf the notice of defects is justified, the defects are to be remedied within an appropriate period of time, and the buyer is to make available to the seller all measures required by the latter to investigate the problem and remedy the defects.\nThe presumption of defectiveness in accordance with \u00a7 924 of the ABGB is ruled out.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Revisions and additions, which, before the agreed work is handed over, prove to be necessary because of organizational deficiencies or technical deficiencies in the program, and for which the seller bears responsibility, are to be carried out free of charge by the seller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The costs for support provided, diagnosis of errors, remedying defects and failures that are the responsibility of the buyer, as well as other corrections, revisions and additions are to be carried out by the seller and the costs charged to the buyer.\nThis is also the case for the remedying of errors when program revisions, additions or other interventions have been carried out by the buyer himself or by a third party.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Furthermore, the seller assumes no warranty for defects, failures or damages that are due to improper use, altered components in the operating system, interfaces and parameters, the use of inappropriate organizational resources and data carriers, insofar as these are stipulated, unusual operating conditions (particularly deviations from the installation and storage provisions) or damage during shipment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For programs that are subsequently altered by programmers of the buyer or by third parties, any existing warranty of the seller\u02bcs is no longer applicable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Insofar as the subject of the order is the revision or supplementation of existing programs, the warranty covers the revision or supplementation.\nThe warranty for the original program does not thereby again come into effect.</li>\n</ol>\nLiability\n<p>The seller is liable for damages insofar as intent or gross negligence can be proven, within the framework of statutory regulations.\nLiability is excluded in case of slight negligence.\nCompensation for consequential damages and financial loss, not realized savings, loss of interest, and damages arising from third-party claims against the seller is in every case, to the extent legally permissible, ruled out.</p>\nProtection of Data Privacy, Nondisclosure\n<p>The seller obligates his employees to observe the provisions of \u00a715 of the Data Privacy Law.</p>\nOther\n<p>Should individual terms of this contract be or become inoperative, this will not affect the remaining terms of this contract.\nThe parties to the contract will work in a spirit of partnership to find an arrangement that approximates as nearly as possible the inoperative terms.</p>\nConcluding Terms\n<p>Insofar as not otherwise agreed, the statutory regulations applicable to registered merchants are exclusively those in force under Austrian law.\nThis is the case also when the order is carried out outside of Austria.\nIn case of conflict, it is agreed that only the responsible local court in the seller\u02bcs place of business has jurisdiction.\nFor sales to consumers within the meaning of the consumer protection law, the above terms are valid only insofar as the consumer protection law does not insist on other conditions.</p>\n<p>Last updated: July 26,

our website\n<p>Every time a page is accessed, our website collects a series of information that is stored in the log files of the server.\nThe following are recorded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the browser types and versions used</li>\n<li>the operating system used by the accessing system</li>\n<li>the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrer)</li>\n<li>the date and time of access</li>\n<li>the Internet address from which access is made</li>\n<li>other similar information used to defend against cyber attacks on our systems</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When using these server log files we do not draw any conclusions about the person concerned.\nRather, this information is needed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to compile anonymous statistics about your visit to our website</li>\n<li>to ensure the long-term operability of our systems and website</li>\n<li>to provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for law enforcement in the event of a cyber attack</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This anonymously collected information is therefore evaluated statistically and with the intent of increasing data protection and data security in our company, which ultimately ensures an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored for three months, separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>\nWhen you buy a license\n<p>As soon as you place a product in the shopping cart, a cookie is set on your web browser.\nThis cookie is necessary for the purchase procedure.\nIt enables us to temporarily store the data you have entered (shopping cart, contact data).\nAfter 24 hours at the latest, the temporarily stored information is deleted.</p>\n<p>If you proceed to checkout, your contact data (name, address, email address, company name, VAT number), the shopping cart, your Internet address and the payment method you have chosen will be stored with us.\nThese data are necessary so that we can issue a proper invoice with the VAT rate applicable for you.</p>\n<p>Depending on the payment method, you will be forwarded to one of our payment service providers (mPAY24 GmbH or PayPal Europe S.\u00e0.r.l.\n&amp.\nCie.\nS.C.A.).</p>\n<p>Sometimes it takes considerable time until the payment processor informs us whether they payment succeeded or failed.\nSince bank transfers or e-check payments can take several weeks, we initially store your data for 30 days.</p>\n<p>If payment is made within 30 days, we will issue a proper invoice and send you the license or gift card codes of the purchased products to the email address provided.\nWe are legally obliged to keep all invoice data and proof of the applicable VAT rate for a certain period of time.\nThis period is 10 years for customers from the EU (except Austria) (\u00a725 para.\n12, Art.\n25a para.\n10 Austrian UStG), or 7 years for all others, counted from the end of the year.</p>\n<p>The name and email address of the license owner, the purchased license keys and the date of purchase are also stored for the term of the license agreement.\nData processing is carried out on the basis of the provisions of the GDPR Art.\n6 para.\n1 lit.\nb (necessity to fulfill the contract) and para.\n1 lit.\nf (affected party is the customer, see recital 47 sentence 2 of the GDPR).</p>\nRedeeming a gift card\n<p>When you redeem a gift card, you become the license owner.\nWe therefore store your name and email address as well as your license key and redemption date for the term of the license agreement.</p>\nDocuments proving residence\n<p>The EU Council Regulation No 967/2012, effective since January 2015, stipulates that for services rendered electronically, the value-added tax applicable at the customer\u2019s place of residence must be charged.\nWe are therefore obliged to prove the location of the customer.</p>\n<p>If this location cannot be sufficiently determined by clues from the purchase process (e.g.\nInternet address), we will request further documents (e.g.\na copy of your ID card).\nThese documents are initially stored for 30 days.\nIf no purchase is made within these 30 days, we will delete the documents.\nIf a purchase is made, we store it for the duration of the legal retention period of 10 years (\u00a725 para.\n12, Art.\n25a para.\n10 Austrian UStG).</p>\nUsing our programs\nSoftware Update Check\n<p>If you have activated \u201cAutomatically check for updates\u201d in the program, it automatically calls up a website at regular intervals.\nThis access is treated in the same way as access via a web browser (see section \u201cVisiting our website\u201d).</p>\nLittle Snitch Research Assistant\n<p>Little Snitch\u2019s Research Assistant can display information about third-party programs on user request.\nFor this purpose, the following information is transmitted at the express request of the user:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name of the program for which information is requested.</li>\n<li>The file path where the program is installed.</li>\n<li>The version number of the program.</li>\n<li>The version number of your operating system.</li>\n<li>If available, the Internet name of the computer the program tries to connect to.</li>\n<li>If available, connection specifications (protocol, port number, inbound/outbound, etc.).</li>\n<li>The language in which the information is requested.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data is never stored on a personal basis, but is immediately combined into anonymous statistics.\nThe statistics are intended to improve and maintain the database.</p>\n<p>Access is via our web server, which stores log files with connection data for three months as described under \u201cVisiting our website\u201d.</p>\nOther forwarding of data\n<p>Under certain circumstances, our software may also pass on data to third parties, e.g.\nif you perform a Google search in LaunchBar, the search term is passed on to Google.\nThis data is not subject to our Privacy Policy because it is not passed on to us or one of our contractors.</p>\n<p>However, we make every effort to make this data transfer as transparent as possible for our products and and even for third party products, that is why we have developed \u201cLittle Snitch\u201d.</p>\n<p>Our programs come with a machine-readable Internet Access Policy (IAP) that lists where the program connects to, why it does so and what happens if you prevent the connection.\nYou can read more about this topic at https://obdev.at/iap</p>\nContact us\n<p>If you contact us via contact form on our website or by email, the data you provide will be stored for the purpose of processing your request and in the event of follow-up questions.\nWe are legally obliged to keep business correspondence for at least seven years (\u00a7\u00a7 190 and 212 Austrian UGB).</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to keep messages which may be relevant in the event of civil law disputes until the respective limitation period.\nThis can be up to 30 years.</p>\nDisclosure to third parties\n<p>Data will not be transmitted to third parties, with the exception of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Payment service provider (see \u201cWhen purchasing a license\u201d above)</li>\n<li>Tax consultant for the fulfilment of our tax obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When purchasing you can choose between the following payment service providers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PayPal Europe S.\u00e0.r.l.\n&amp.\nCie.\nS.C.A.</li>\n<li>mPAY24 GmbH (Austria)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The payment service provider receives your shopping cart and your full name from us.\nFor fraud prevention, PayPal also receives your email address and the country code of your address.\nPayment data (credit card number, PayPal login data, account data or the like) is entered exclusively at the payment service provider\u2019s website and is never transferred to us.</p>\n<p>mPAY24 is a contract processor in the sense of the GDPR.\nPayPal is itself controller in the sense of the GDPR, because you must already have a PayPal account to process the payment and therefore have entered into an agreement with PayPal.</p>\nEvaluation of data\n<p>We only collect anonymous statistics about the use of our services in order to improve the user experience of our website and our software.\nIt should be expressly mentioned here that we do not perform <em>Profiling</em>.</p>\nYour rights\n<p>In principle, you have the rights to information, correction, deletion, restriction, data transferability, revocation and objection.\nIf you believe that the processing of your data violates data protection law or your data protection claims have otherwise been violated in any way, you can complain to the supervisory authority.\nIn Austria, this is the data protection authority:</p>\n<p>\u00d6sterreichische Datenschutzbeh\u00f6rde<br>\nHohenstaufengasse 3<br>\n1010 Vienna</p>\n<p>Phone: +43 1 531
