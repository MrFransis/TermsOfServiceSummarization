and Streamable agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties.\nIf a settlement is not reached within a period of 60 days, then either party may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, California.\nEach party gives up such party\u2019s right to litigate such party\u2019s disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Streamable are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in

will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.\nThe arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties.\nFailure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award.\nConsistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third-Party
