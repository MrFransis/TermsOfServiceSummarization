provides the open source tool called \"Forem,\" available at www.forem.com, that allows our customers to create and operate their own online forums, and also offers hosting services for those forums.\nThis Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand how we as a company collect, use, and share your personal information, and to help you understand and exercise your privacy rights.<br>\n<br>What's with the defined terms?<br>You'll notice that some words appear in quotes in this Privacy Policy.\nThey're called \"defined terms,\" and we use them so that we don't have to repeat the same language again and again.\nThey mean the same thing in every instance, to help us make sure that this Privacy Policy is consistent.\nWe've included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them in context.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>1.\nWHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?<br>2.\n</strong>\n<strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br>3.\n</strong>\n<strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION<br>4.\n</strong>\n<strong>HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION<br>5.\n</strong>\n<strong>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES AND RIGHTS<br>6.\n</strong>\n<strong>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION<br>7.\n</strong>\n<strong>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS<br>8.\n</strong>\n<strong>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>9.\n</strong>\n<strong>SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS<br>10.\n</strong>\n<strong>SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE FOR NEVADA RESIDENTS<br>11.\n</strong>\n<strong>CHILDREN'S INFORMATION<br>12.\n</strong>\n<strong>OTHER PROVISIONS<br>13.\n</strong>\n<strong>CONTACT US<br>\n<br>\u200d</strong>1.\nWHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?<br>This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed by us, including on our websites, mobile applications, and other online or offline offerings \u2014 basically anything we do.\nTo make this Privacy Policy easier to read, our websites, mobile applications (\"app\"), and other offerings are all collectively called the <strong>\"Services.\"<br>\n<br>\u200d</strong>There are two types of people we collect personal information from: our customers, who use our Services to run and host their own forums (we'll call them <strong>\"Forem Operators\"</strong>), and the people who interact with those forums or otherwise use our Services, such as by using our app.\n(we'll call them <strong>\"Users\"</strong>).<br>\n<br>\u200d<strong>An Important Note for Users: </strong>While we collect some of your information on our own behalf, technically we also process some of your information on behalf of our Forem Operators when you interact with their forums.\nThat processing is governed by the contracts that we have in place with each Forem Operator, not this Privacy Policy.\nPut another way: when you share your information on a DEV-hosted forum, we at DEV are basically just the \"pipes\" \u2014 we process the data on behalf of the Forem Operator, but don't do anything with it ourselves beyond what we're required to do under our contract (and by law).\nSimilarly, if you use our mobile application, you may also interact with forums that are hosted by third parties who are not Forem Operators, but rather use Forem's open-source tool to operate their forums \u2014 these third parties do all their hosting themselves.\nRegardless of whether DEV or a third party is doing the hosting, the important thing to remember is this: if you share or make available your information on a forum created with Forem, the Forem Operator's or third-party host's privacy policy applies to that information.\nAny questions or requests relating to the information you post on that forum should be directed to the relevant Forem Operator and/or third-party forum host, not us.(You can still ask us about the information we collect ourselves, though.)<br>\n<br>2.\nPERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br>The categories of personal information we collect depend on whether you're a User or Forem Operator, how you interact with us, our Services, and the requirements of applicable law.\nBreaking it down, we collect three types of information: (1) information that you provide to us directly, (2) information we obtain automatically when you use our Services, and (3) information we get about you from other sources (such as third-party services and organizations).\nMore details are below.<br>\n<br>\n<br>A.\nInformation You Provide to Us Directly<br>We may collect the following personal information that you provide to us.<br>\u200d<strong>\n<br>\u2022 Account Creation (for Forem Operators): </strong>We'll require your name and email address to get started, as well as some details about the Forem you want to run, such as: whether you're running the Forem on your own behalf or as part of an organization, and details about the community you want to support (how big is it, what topics does it cover, where do members currently communicate, how/if the community earns money, whether the community is open, invite-only or paid, any existing social media accounts, etc.) You'll need to tell us a bit about your personal coding background, and you'll have the option to provide your DEV username as well, if you are a member of the DEV.to community.<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Account Creation (for Users): </strong>Forem Operators determine what information is required for User account creation with respect to their individual forums.<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Interactive Features (for Users).\n</strong>Like any other social network, both we and other Users of our Services may collect personal information that you submit or make available through our interactive features (e.g., messaging and chat features, commenting functionalities, forums, blogs, posts, and other social media pages).\nWhile we do have private messages that are only between you and the person you're messaging (as well as us and the Forem Operator), any information you provide using the public sharing features of the Services, such as the information you post to your public profile or the topics you follow is public, including to recruiters and prospective employers, and is not subject to any of the privacy protections we mention in this Privacy Policy except where legally required.\n<strong>Please exercise caution before revealing any information that may identify you in the real world to others.<br>\n<br>\u2022 Purchases.\n</strong>If you buy stuff on our shop site https://shop.dev.to/ (as either a User or Forem Operator), or otherwise if you pay us in connection with your use of the Forem service, we may collect personal information and details associated with your purchases, including payment information.\nAny payments made via our Services are processed by third-party payment processors, such as Stripe, Shopify, and PayPal.\nWe do not directly collect or store any payment card information entered through our Services, but may receive information associated with your payment card information (e.g., your billing details).<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Your Communications with Us (Users and Forem Operators).\n</strong>We may collect personal information, such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter or loyalty program, request customer or technical support, apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>\u2022 Surveys.\n</strong>We may contact you to participate in surveys.\nIf you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include personal information (for example, your home address).<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Sweepstakes or Contests.\n</strong>We may collect personal information you provide for any sweepstakes or contests that we offer.\nIn some jurisdictions, we are required to publicly share information of sweepstakes and contest winners.\n&nbsp.\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>\u2022 Conferences, Trade Shows, and Other Events.\n</strong>We may collect personal information from individuals when we attend conferences, trade shows, and other events.\n&nbsp;<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Business Development and Strategic

after using our Services, information about the links you click, the types of content you interact with, the frequency and duration of your activities, and other information about how you use our Services.\nIn addition, we may collect information that other people provide about you when they use our Services, including information about you when they tag you in their posts.\n<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Other Technologies.\n</strong>We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on our Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (\"Technologies\") to automatically collect information through your use of our Services.\n<strong>&nbsp.\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Cookies.\n</strong>Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers that store preferences and facilitate and enhance your experience.\n&nbsp.\n<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Pixel Tags/Web Beacons.\n</strong>A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in our Services that collects information about engagement on our Services.\nThe use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement.\nWe may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.<strong>\n<br>\n<br>\u200d</strong>Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:<strong> &nbsp.\n<br>\n<br>\u2022 Operationally

analytics partners include Google Analytics.\nFor more information, please visit Google Analytics' Privacy Policy.\nTo learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analytics' use of your information,

organizations.\nFor example, if you access our Services through a third-party application, such as an app store, a third-party login service (e.g., through Twitter, Apple, or GitHub), or a social
