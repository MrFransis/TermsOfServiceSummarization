appreciation for a particular track or album (\u201cProject\u201d) on the Audiomack Service or Platform (as defined in the Audiomack Terms of Service).\nTokens include a badge that you can include on your Audiomack profile, and/or an image of the Project artwork that you can share via your other social media profiles and channels, in each case demonstrating your support for the relevant Project.\nAudiomack intends to share revenue from purchase of Tokens with applicable Artists.</p>\n<p>If you choose to purchase or use Tokens, these Terms apply to you.\nThese Terms may change from time to time.\nWe will notify you of any significant changes by email, but we also recommend you review this page periodically to make sure you\u2019re aware of the latest Terms.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Program is only open to certain Artists on the Audiomack Service and Platform, as determined by us at our discretion.\nFor this reason, you may not always be able to buy Tokens for every Artist or Project that you may wish to support.</li>\n<li>You can purchase Tokens if you are at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), or if you are at least 13 years of age and are acting under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms.</li>\n<li>Using Tokens to support an Artist\u2019s Project does not give you any rights with respect to that Project.</li>\n<li>Audiomack intends to share the revenue generated from the sale of Tokens with applicable Artists and/or their representatives under the terms of agreements that Audiomack has entered into with those Artists and/or their representatives.\nAudiomack may retain a share of this revenue for itself, and may also be required to share revenue with certain third-party platform providers under the terms of agreements with those third-party platform providers.\nFor this reason, Audiomack cannot guarantee that the money you spend on Tokens will be shared exclusively with the specific Artists whose Projects you choose to support using your Tokens.</li>\n<li>We may change or withdraw the Program at any time at our sole discretion, and subject to applicable law, we will not be obligated to refund the value of any Tokens, or otherwise be liable to you in any way, if we do so.\nPlease bear this in mind when deciding whether to purchase Tokens, or how many Tokens you wish to purchase at any given time.\nWe may also introduce or discontinue different types of Token or change the price of Tokens at any time, although this will not affect any Tokens you have already purchased.</li>\n<li>The price of Tokens will be provided at the time of purchase.\nAll charges and payments for Tokens will be made in the currency specified at the time of purchase.\nCurrency exchange settlements, foreign transaction fees and payment channel fees, if any, are based on your agreement with the applicable payment provider.</li>\n<li>All sales of Tokens are final.\nTokens are non-refundable, except as required by applicable law.\nTokens are available to be used as soon as your payment is processed, and by purchasing Tokens, you agree that you will waive any statutory right you may have to change your mind about your purchase, or to cancel your purchase within any applicable cooling off period.</li>\n<li>The associated value of the Tokens that you purchase will be credited to your Audiomack account.\nIf you choose to support a Project using your Token(s), the associated value of the Token(s) will be deducted from your Audiomack account.\nThis deduction is final, and you will not be entitled to reverse or cancel your support, or claim any refund or credit, for example, if you choose to delete any post featuring your Token on any third party platform.</li>\n<li>If any Tokens are subject to sales tax in your jurisdiction and you have not paid the applicable sales tax to us when you purchase your Tokens, then you will be responsible for the payment of the applicable sales tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority.</li>\n<li>Tokens do not constitute property, and have no monetary value.\nTokens are not currency, and do not constitute cash or cash equivalent.\nTokens cannot be exchanged for cash or other goods or services.\nTokens cannot be transferred to or exchanged with other users, and other than any Token designed for social sharing via third party platforms, cannot be used outside of the Audiomack Service or Platform.</li>\n<li>Purchase and use of Tokens requires you to have an Audiomack account.\nIf you delete your account for any reason, if you permanently lose access to your account, or if your account is terminated pursuant to the Audiomack Terms of Service, you will not be able to purchase Tokens and you will lose access to any Tokens you may already have purchased.\nWe will not be liable for any refunds in respect of any unused Tokens in these cases.</li>\n<li>Without limiting any of our other rights, we may prevent you from purchasing or using Tokens if you breach any of these Terms, or breach any provision of the Audiomack Terms of Service.</li>\n<li>These Terms govern your purchase and use of Tokens and are supplemental to the Audiomack Terms of Service and other terms, conditions and policies governing your use of the Audiomack Service or Platform.\nYour purchase of Tokens may also be subject to additional third party terms, for example relating to in-app purchases, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that you read, understand, and comply with applicable third party terms.\nIn the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Audiomack Terms of Service, these Terms will govern solely with respect to the Program, and solely to the extent of that conflict.</li>\n<li>If you have any questions about these Terms or the Program, you can contact us at support@audiomack.com.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This site uses cookies.\nBy using this site, you

your information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4 - How we share your information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5 - How we use cookies and technology</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6 - Accessing and updating your information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7 - Transfer to other countries/territories</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8 - Links</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9 - Children</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10 - Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Since day one, Audiomack has cared deeply about privacy and respecting our users.\nProtecting your data is extremely important to us, and this page will help you understand how and why we collect, store, transmit, protect, and delete your data.</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy is designed to do two things: protect individual user privacy, and support free listening that pays artists, labels, and content creators.</p>\n<p>Listeners deserve a great music service even if they can\u2019t afford a monthly subscription.\nTo make this work on Audiomack, we use digital advertising to pay artists for plays and invest in improving our service.\nThis model is designed to provide access to streaming music without compromising individual privacy.\nOur users are anonymous to advertisers, and can delete their data from our system completely whenever they decide to.</p>\n<p>Before we get into all the details, let\u2019s talk about your rights as an Audiomack user.\nWe\u2019ve put together a User Bill of Rights, written in plain english, that clearly outlines how and when your data is used on our platforms.</p>User Bill of Rights1 - Audiomack will only collect the minimum amount of data necessary.<p>Audiomack will only collect and store <strong>the absolute minimum amount of data possible</strong> to effectively run our platform.\nWe will, for example, store data on what songs you play on our platform to enable better recommendations in the future, let artists know when their music is being listened to, and provide our label partners with aggregate stream counts necessary for accounting.</p>2 - Audiomack does not sell data.<p>Many apps, both ad-supported and subscription based, take their user data and sell it to data brokers, location companies, and other third parties for a lump sum or recurring payment.\n<strong>Audiomack does not sell your personal data to third parties, period.</strong>\n</p>3 - Audiomack does not transmit private or sensitive data to ad providers.<p>We need to run ads to keep our service alive.\nWhen you stream a song on Audiomack, a rightsholder (artist, record label, etc) gets paid out on that stream, meaning we must create some revenue in exchange for your usage of the platform.\nFor users who do not want to subscribe, this means we must run ads.</p>\n<p>Examples of data we may transfer to advertisers are IDFA or Android Advertising ID for app users, non-identifiable browser information for web users (language, browser name, e.g.\nChrome or Safari, etc), genre of a song being listened to, and location to ensure ads reach a user in the correct country and city.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Most importantly, we do not allow ad providers to tie an ad request (when your mobile device or browser \u201crequests\u201d an ad on page load) to your Audiomack profile.</strong> An ad provider does not, for example, receive your name, username, email address, photo, listening history, or phone number as part of the ad request.</p>4 - You may request account and data deletion at any time, for any reason.<p>If you want to delete your account and your personal data, you can contact us by sending an email to privacy@audiomack.com from the email address associated with your account OR by logging into your account and submitting a support ticket requesting that Audiomack erase any and all personal data tied to your account.\nAlternatively, you may delete your account using our user dashboard.</p>5 - Audiomack will take all reasonable steps to protect your account and data.<p>We use best-in-class data storage systems, encryption, and vendors to ensure your data and account on Audiomack stay secure.\n</p>\n<p>In the next sections, we\u2019ll dive into a lot more detail about how data is collected, stored, and protected on our platform.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to support@audiomack.com.</p>1 -
