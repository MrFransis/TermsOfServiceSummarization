information about you such as name, address, phone number.&nbsp.\nE-mails are only used if you register as a member of the forums.\nHowever,\nWordReference.com does obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example) and your IP address.\nThe information collected by WordReference.com is used for the purpose of troubleshooting, targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of advertisers.<br>\n<br>\nIn some cases, we will also collect information on your preferred target language for translations and search history.\nThis is only used for making the site easier to use and possibly ad targeting.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nWordReference uses \"cookies\" to enhance the user experience, such as remembering your favorite dictionary, counting visitors through tracking and tracking by online advertisers.\nIf you wish to use WordReference without cookies, major web browsers like Chrome and Firefox have add-ons that allow you to block them.\nBy not blocking them and continuing to use this site, you are consenting to their use.\nIf that is not good enough for you, then please do not use this website.\nPlease note: all of our competitors use cookies, as well.\nWe suggest that you pay money for a paper dictionary instead of using this free website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Advertising</strong>\n<br>\nMuch like Google and Facebook, WordReference gets its revenue from and would not exist without advertising.\nWe use a number of third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.\nThese companies may use information about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements\non this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to\nknow your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please go to www.networkadvertising.org/choices.\nIf you live in the EU, please see www.youronlinechoices.com.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>\n<br>\nIn the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique \"cookie\" on your browser.\nCookies might also be used by other companies, such as Facebook.com and we use analytics software such as Google Analytics to count our visitors.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Forum user tracking</strong>\n<br>\nSpam and trolls are major problems in the forums.\nTo keep the site enjoyable and safe for all users, we log IP address from registration and posting messages and save old email addresses of registered forum members.\nThis information is invaluable for security of the site and its members.\n<br>We generally do not retain IP logs of unregistered visitors in more than 30 days.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and Opt Out</strong>\nIf you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies.\nPlease search the web to find out how.\n&nbsp.\nIf you wish to opt out of the data collection, please refer to the link above.\nThere are also web browser add-ons that can accomplish this and even keep cookies from WordReference and other sites and advertisers that you choose off of your browser.\nIf you want to hide your IP address, please instead use the Tor Browser to visit WordReference.<br>\n<br>If you have any additional questions about WordReference.com's dedication to consumer privacy, please write the site administrator through the \"Contact Us\" form in the
