arbitration before one or more neutral arbitrators in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.\nYou understand that by this Arbitration Agreement, you are giving up the right to a jury trial and to have your dispute resolved in court.</li>\n<li>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Arbitration Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope, applicability, or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by arbitration.</li>\n<li>Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration shall be conducted via telephone, videoconference, or within the county in which you reside.\nYou have the right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Any arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are not permitted.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp.\nAn arbitrator, however, can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.</li>\n<li>You and we agree that each party will provide written notice to the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to initiating an arbitration or small claims court proceeding, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute informally.\nNotice to us shall be sent to us (or any of us) by certified mail or courier to:</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Foot Locker, Inc.<br>330 West 34<sup>th</sup> Street<br>New York, New York 10001<br>Attention: General

will be sent electronically and/or to the most-recent address we have in our records for you.\nit is your responsibility to keep your address up to date.&nbsp.\nIf you and us cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or us may, as appropriate and in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for above, file a claim in court.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and, where applicable, the JAMS Consumer Arbitration Minimum Standards for consumers.\nThe JAMS rule are

to be approximately equivalent to current Court filing fees), and any counsel that you elect to retain, you will not be responsible for any costs associated with the JAMS proceeding.&nbsp.\nIf you elect to be represented by counsel, you are responsible for any costs and fees associated with that counsel.\n&nbsp;To the extent permitted by law, an arbitrator may award costs and/or fees if the arbitrator finds the party\u2019s claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be frivolous or asserted or conducted for an improper purpose.\n<ul>\n<li>The parties are entitled to seek recovery of costs and attorney\u2019s fees to the same extent they would be entitled to seek such recovery for the same claim in court under controlling law.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written

awarded.\nThe arbitrator shall follow the applicable law.</li>\n<li>This Arbitration Agreement shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nJudgment on an arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>For any Dispute where either the amount alleged to be in controversy at the outset of the Dispute, or the amount recovered by either party in arbitration, exceeds $100,000 or involves a request for public injunctive relief, the Dispute shall be subject to JAMS Optional Appeal Overview.\nThe decision in such an action shall be required to be in the form of a reasoned, written decision and the appeal will be heard by a panel of three JAMS neutrals from the appellate panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The parties shall maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding and the award, including the hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver Of Class Or Consolidated Actions</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>You and we agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.\nYou and we further agree to not participate in any consolidated, class, or representative proceeding (existing or future) brought by any third party arising out of or relating to any dispute with a third party.</li>\n<li>The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).</li>\n<li>This Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions Section (the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d) shall survive any termination of the Services and/or these Terms.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\nIf, however, the Class Action Waiver set forth in section 20.2 hereof is deemed void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be deemed null and void in its entirety.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to Reject Arbitration.</strong> You have the right to opt out of binding
