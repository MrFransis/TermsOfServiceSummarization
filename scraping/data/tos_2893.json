explained to you when we ask for your consent (for example, using your GPS location to provide location-based experiences).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we may process your data as necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>comply with legal obligations which we believe apply to us (including accounting and tax requirements and requirements to provide information to competent authorities upon due request) or</li>\n<li>protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we may process your data for additional purposes which are compatible with any of the purposes listed above.</p>\n<p>We do not use your data to make automated decisions which significantly affect you.\nBy an \u201cautomated decision\u201d, we mean a decision made by an information system without any human intervention.</p>\n3.1&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Advertising\n<p>Advertising funds our Services and enables us to make our Games available free of charge.\nIn our Games, we show our own ads and also ads from third parties.\nWe also advertise outside of our Services on third-party properties such as websites or applications.\nThis section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes.</p>\n<p>Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers.\nAn \u201c<strong>Advertising ID</strong>\u201d is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of a device.\nIt is consistent across applications from different publishers.\nThe Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (\u201c<strong>IDFA</strong>\u201d) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (\u201c<strong>GAID</strong>\u201d) on Android devices.</p>\n<p>Advertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes.\nYou can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes.\nUsing the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID.\nFor example, you can \u201climit ad tracking\u201d on iOS devices or \u201copt out of interest-based ads\u201d on Android devices.\nThese settings are specific to each device, which means that you should set them to your desired state on each of your devices individually.\nIt may take some time for your updated settings to take effect.\nPlease consider that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>For more information on mobile privacy settings, you may refer to third-party resources such as:</p>\n<p>https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When you see ads in our Games</strong>, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners.\nOur advertising partners may also collect information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs).\nIn each case, they may use your data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalize the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID).\nFor more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When you see our ads outside of our Services</strong> (for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Services.\nAd networks may also use your data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>limit the number of times you see our ads,</li>\n<li>inform users who have previously played our Games about new content, updates, or other news related to those Games, or</li>\n<li>refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, ad networks may provide services where they use Advertising IDs or other identifiers to find users who are likely to be interested in our Services because their past activity or interests are similar to those of others known by the ad network to use our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Services</strong>, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad.\nMeasurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads.\nIt is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behavior, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.</p>\n3.2&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Cookies and similar technologies on our Websites\n<p>Like most websites today, our Websites may use cookies or similar technologies (for example, local shared objects or web beacons).</p>\n<p>A \u201c<strong>cookie</strong>\u201d is a small file your browser stores when told to do so by a website.\nCookies can be set by either the website you visit (\u201c<strong>first-party cookies</strong>\u201d) or a third party involved in providing content, functionality, or services such as analytics or advertising for the website you visit (\u201c<strong>third-party cookies</strong>\u201d).\nCookies are typically used to identify or \u201cremember\u201d your device, for example to enable functionality, facilitate audience measurement, improve performance, or store your preferences.</p>\n<p>Using your browser or device settings, you can control the use of cookies, for example by disabling some or all cookies or configuring your browser or device to notify you when cookies are being set.\nHowever, please consider that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.</p>\n4&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;What data do we process?\n<p>We may process the following data relating to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your name, email address, or other contact information if you have

from third-party payment service providers to validate those purchases,</li>\n<li>if you have subscribed to our communications, your content preferences or other information you submit to us when

information explained to you when asking for your consent (for example, your GPS location for location-based experiences).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not expect or intend to collect or otherwise process

orientation, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership, or information about your criminal offences or convictions.\nPlease do not provide this kind of information to us or use the Services to make it available to others.</p>\n5&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Where do we collect your data from?\n<p>We may collect data relating to you from the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>directly from you when you submit it to us (for example, when registering an account with us, subscribing to our communications, sending support enquiries to us, or responding to our surveys),</li>\n<li>directly from you and/or your device by automatic means when you use our Services or interact with our ads outside of our Services (for example, on third-party websites or applications), including through cookies or similar technologies or software development kits (SDKs),</li>\n<li>if you interact with ads in our Games or our ads outside of our Services (for example, on third-party websites or applications), from our advertising partners involved in the delivery and measurement of those ads,</li>\n<li>if you choose to connect a third-party account (for example, a social media account) with our Services, from the third-party account provider,</li>\n<li>if you make purchases in our Services, from the third-party payment service provider involved in those transactions, or</li>\n<li>with your consent, from other sources explained to you when asking for your consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Providing data to us is not mandatory.\nHowever, we are unable to provide the Services, or some parts or features of the Services, without processing your data.\nIf you use our Services, we will collect data relating to you for some or all of the purposes described in this notice, depending on the Services you decide to use and your choices when using them.\nYou have a number of options to limit or control the extent to which your data is processed.\nFor example, you can choose to not connect your third-party accounts with our Games, use your device settings to reset or limit the use of your Advertising ID, or disable some or all cookies from your browser settings.</p>\n6&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Who do we share your data with?\n<p>We may share your data with third parties to achieve the purposes described in this notice.\nThis may include sharing data with the following types of recipients:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>other companies in the Rovio group, for example where they help us develop or operate our Games or other Services,</li>\n<li>persons or companies outside of the Rovio group that provide services to us and process data on our behalf when providing those services (for example, providers of hosting services, analytics services, services that add functionality to the Services, or other services that help us develop and operate our Services),</li>\n<li>other partners we work with while providing the Services (who may process your data independently of us), including advertising partners and others listed here,</li>\n<li>prospective or actual buyers (including their agents or advisors) in the context of a planned or actual acquisition, merger, or other business restructuring,</li>\n<li>competent courts of law or other government authorities where we believe disclosure is necessary as a matter of applicable law or regulation,</li>\n<li>any person or entity where we believe disclosure is necessary to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights or to protect your or another person\u2019s vital interests, or</li>\n<li>with any other person or entity with your consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, please consider that some information you submit or make available through the Services may be visible to other users of our Services.\nThis typically applies to, for example, your public profile information in our Games (such as your in-game alias), your chat messages in our Games, and information used to provide social features such as clans or leaderboards.</p>\n<p>In connection with the processing activities described in this notice, your data may be transferred to and/or processed in countries outside of the European Union (\u201c<strong>EU</strong>\u201d) and the European Economic Area (\u201c<strong>EEA</strong>\u201d).\nFor example, a number of servers we use for hosting data are located in the United States, and some of our group companies or the service providers we use to provide the Services may be located outside of the EU and the EEA.\nThese countries may have data protection laws that differ from the laws of your country.\nIn these cases, we will provide appropriate safeguards to protect your personal data.\nThese safeguards may include compliance with the European Commission\u2019s standard contractual clauses for transfers of personal data or reliance on the EU-US Privacy Shield framework.\nUpon request, we can provide you a copy of the European Commission\u2019s standard contractual clauses and further details on the applicable safeguards.</p>\n7&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;How long do we keep your data?\n<p>We will keep your data for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected, including to provide you with the Services or to comply with any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\nWe may periodically delete or de-identify inactive accounts or other data in our Games or other Services.</p>\n<p>After the applicable retention period, we will either delete or de-identify your data or, if neither deletion or de-identification is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), isolate your data from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible.\nWe may continue to use data that is not identifiable to you (for example, aggregate data).</p>\n8&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;How do we keep your data secure?\n<p>We have adopted measures to provide your data a level of security appropriate for the degree of risk involved with the processing activities described in this notice.\nThese measures are designed to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration as well as unauthorized disclosure or access.\nThe specific measures we employ vary, but typically include, for example, encryption in transit, pseudonymization of identifying data where feasible, controls to limit access to services or systems that contain personal data, and maintaining procedures to handle any suspected security incidents.</p>\n9&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Your rights\n<p>If we are processing your data, you have the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>access, correct, or request the deletion of your data,</li>\n<li>request us to restrict our processing of your data,</li>\n<li>object to our processing of your data to the extent our processing is based on our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, or</li>\n<li>where technically feasible, request a copy of the personal data you have provided to us in machine-readable format.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where our processing of your data is based on your consent, you also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nPlease be aware that we may continue processing your data despite your withdrawal of consent, if we have a lawful basis for doing so.</p>\n<p>To access your data in our Games or to request its deletion, please use the automatic tools provided in our Games.\nThese tools are specific to each of our Games.\nYou will find them in the game settings under \u201cTerms &amp.\nPrivacy\u201d or a similarly named option.\nOn the same page, you can also opt out of our personalized offers, where applicable.\nWe ask you to primarily use these tools to submit requests, because that helps us validate, process, and fulfill your request more quickly and reliably.</p>\n<p>To unsubscribe from our marketing communications, please use the unsubscribe link provided in the messages we send.\nThe unsubscribe link is typically found at the end of the message.</p>\n<p>To exercise any of your rights, you may also contact us at privacy@rovio.com.\nTo fulfill requests submitted by email, we may need to confirm your identity to verify your right to make the request, which may involve requesting additional information from you.\nFor example, we may ask you to provide sufficiently detailed information about the account to which the request relates to enable us to confirm that you are the account holder or acting on their behalf.\nWhile we will usually not do so, we reserve the right to charge you an appropriate fee for the exercise of your rights where permitted by applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Finally, you always have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority regarding our processing of your data.\nFor more information, please contact your local data protection authority (for example, the Office of the Data Protection Ombudsman in Finland).</p>\n10&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Note for California residents\n<p>If you are a California resident, please be aware that under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended (\u201c<strong>CCPA</strong>\u201d), you are entitled to receive specific information on how we process your data.\nYou also have specific rights to your data, including the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.\nTo review this specific information and familiarize yourself with your rights under the CCPA, please review our Supplemental Privacy Disclosure for California Residents.</p>\n11&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Age limit\n<p>Under our Terms of Service, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age.\nHowever, we do not know the specific age of individual users of our Services.\nIf you are under 13 years of age, please do not provide your personal data (including your name, address, telephone number, or email address) to us or use the Services to make your personal data available to others.</p>\n<p>If we discover that we hold personal data relating to a user under 13 years of age, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that we process that data according to the requirements of applicable laws and regulations or promptly delete the data from our records.\nIf you have reason to believe we hold personal data relating to a user under 13 years of age, please contact us.</p>\n12&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;Changes\n<p>We may update this notice from time to time, for example due to changes in our operations or the legal obligations that apply to us.\nUpdates will be made available here.\nWe may also inform you of any changes by other means that are appropriate to the significance of the changes.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-03-29 17:39:37.905545", "updated_at": "2021-03-29 17:39:44.363963"}, {"id": 4487, "name": "Terms of Service", "url": "https://www.rovio.com/terms-of-service/",
