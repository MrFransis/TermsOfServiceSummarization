withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity, then we may pay to you the part of the Creator Earnings which we determine to be unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity.\nHowever, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold

Terms.\n</li>\n<li>\"<strong>Referred Creator</strong>\" means the person who joins OnlyFans as a Creator via the Referring User's unique referral link.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>What is the OnlyFans Referral Program?</strong> OnlyFans offers a referral program by which existing Users can introduce people who are interested in becoming Creators to OnlyFans and receive referral payments from OnlyFans which are calculated and limited as described in these Referral Program Terms.\n</p>\n<p> The OnlyFans Referral Program is operated by Fenix International Limited.\nWe are a limited company registered in England and Wales, with company registration number 10354575 and we have our registered office address at Fourth Floor, Imperial House, 8 Kean Street, London, WC2B 4AS.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>The rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only Users of OnlyFans with a current User account can participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program.\nIf a User's account has been suspended or terminated by us for any reason or deleted by the User, that User will not be eligible to participate in the OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>\n<li>You will need on your User account page to add bank account details of your own bank account in order to receive referral payments under the OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>\n<li>Each User has a unique referral link (which can be accessed via the User's User account) which the User may share with others.\nWhen sharing your unique referral link you must not impersonate OnlyFans or give the impression that your referral link is being shared or promoted by us.\nYou must not use Google Ads or any similar advertising platform or search engine advertising service to share or promote your unique referral link.\nUpon our request, you must disclose the methods by which you share your unique referral link in the Bio/Website field of your OnlyFans account.</li>\n<li>The Referred Creator must click on your unique referral link and then register with OnlyFans using the same browser that they used to click on your unique referral link.\nIf someone registers with OnlyFans other than by using your unique referral link, we will not link that account to your referral and we will not make any referral payment to you.</li>\n<li>The Referred Creator must not have opened a User account with OnlyFans (whether under the same name or another name) before clicking on your unique referral link.\nIf the Referred Creator is currently or has previously been a User of OnlyFans we will not make any referral payment to you for the referral.</li>\n<li>If the Referred Creator sets up more than one User account we will make referral payments to you on the earnings made by the Referred Creator from their first User account only.\nWe will not pay any referral payments to you on any further User accounts set up by the Referred Creator.\n</li>\n<li>We will not pay any referral payments to you on any referral of a Referred Creator which we determine is owned or operated by you, or is in a commercial relationship with you.\nYou will provide any

Creator.</li>\n<li>\n<p>You agree that when promoting OnlyFans in any way as a Referring User:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you will not give a false impression of OnlyFans, the services, programs, and content (including Content) made available through OnlyFans, its Users or the Terms of Service.\nand</li>\n<li>you will not make any statements which suggest to a potential Creator that the potential Creator will make a particular sum of money (or any money) from their use of OnlyFans, or any statements regarding the likely number of Fans.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Referral payments:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>How are referral payments calculated?</strong> Once a Referred Creator has become a registered User of OnlyFans in accordance with the rules of the OnlyFans Referral Program described above, we will pay the Referring User a referral payment equal to five per cent.\n(5%) of Fan Payments generated by the Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, up to a maximum referral payment by OnlyFans to the Referring User of US$50,000 per Referred Creator.\n</p>\n<p> This means that if a Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of US$1 million or more in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User's referral payments in relation to that Referred Creator will be capped at US$50,000 in total.\nHowever, if the Referred Creator generates Fan Payments with a total value of less than US$1 million in the twelve months after the date on which that Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, then the Referring User will be paid five per cent.\n(5%) of the Fan Payments generated by that Referred Creator in the twelve months after the date on which the Referred Creator becomes a registered User of OnlyFans, following which no further referral payments will be made to the Referring User in respect of that Referred Creator.\n</p>\n<p> For all referrals made prior to 1 May 2020, we will make referral payments to the relevant Referring Users until 1 May 2021 or until US$50,000 has been paid out by us to the Referring User on the referral, whichever occurs first.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>VAT:</strong> If you are a Referring User you should know that all referral payments payable to you by us will be inclusive of any VAT (as defined in the Terms of Use for Creators) which is or becomes chargeable on any supplies made by you, except as provided for in the \"Promoting Tax compliance and VAT\" section of the Terms of Use for Creators.</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Warning:</strong> In compliance with regulation 3 of the Trading

for a participant in the OnlyFans Referral Program (including Referring Users and Referred Creators) to persuade anyone to make a payment by promising benefits from getting others to join the OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>\n<li>Do not be misled by claims that high earnings are easily achieved from participation in the OnlyFans Referral Program.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Choosing a payout method to receive referral payments:</strong> In order to be able to receive referral payments you must first choose one of the payout methods provided by OnlyFans in your country of residence.\nThese methods are called \"Payout Options\".</li>\n<li>\n<strong>How frequently are referral payments made?</strong> We will transfer to your OnlyFans account the referral payment due to you on Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in a calendar month on or around the first day of the next calendar month (which means, for example, that referral payments due to you in respect of Fan Payments made to the Referred Creator in February shall be paid to you on or around 1 March).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Who bears the cost of the referral payment?</strong> The cost of the referral payment is borne by us, not the Referred Creator.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Our rights relating to the referral program.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If referral payments have been made incorrectly then we have the right to recover the wrongly paid sums from the User to whom the wrongly paid sums have been paid.</li>\n<li>We may request you or Referred Creators (or both) to provide us with ID and other information reasonably required by us to verify any referral payment to be made and the person to whom any referral payment should be made.\nFailure to provide any information requested by us may lead to you losing your entitlement to referral payments in respect of the relevant Referred Creator.</li>\n<li>We may change any aspect of the OnlyFans Referral Program (including how referral payments are calculated) or discontinue the OnlyFans Referral Program at any time, but no change will deprive any Referring User of referral payments already earned based on Fan Payments made to Referred Creators before the changes came into effect.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Circumstances in which we may withhold referral payments:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We may withhold all or any part of the referral payments due to you but not yet paid out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if we think that you have or may have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service;</li>\n<li>if you attempt or threaten to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User).\nor</li>\n<li>if we suspect that all or any part of the referral payments due to you result from unlawful activity, either by you, by the Fan who made the Fan Payment to the Referred Creator which resulted in the referral payment, or by the Referred Creator to whom the Fan Payment was made which resulted in the referral payment,</li>\n</ul>\n<p> for as long as is necessary to investigate the actual, threatened or suspected breach(es) by you or the suspected unlawful activity (as applicable).\nIf following our investigation, we conclude that (i) you have seriously or repeatedly breached any part of the Terms of Service.\n(ii) you have attempted or threatened to breach any part of the Terms of Service in a way which has or could have serious consequences for us or another User (including actual or possible loss caused to us or another User), and/or (iii) all or any part of referral payments due to you result from unlawful activity, we may notify you that you have forfeited all or any part of your referral payments.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>We shall not have any responsibility to you if we withhold or forfeit any payment due to you under the OnlyFans Referral Program where we have a right to do so under these Referral Program Terms.</li>\n<li>If we are withholding all or any part of the referral payments due to you and we determine that part of the referral payments withheld by us is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity, then we may pay to you the part of the referral payments which is unrelated to breaches by you of the Terms of Service or suspected unlawful activity.\nHowever, you agree that if we consider that your breach(es) of the Terms of Service has or may cause us loss, we may withhold all referral payments due to you but not yet paid and we may set off such amounts against any losses suffered by us.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Last updated: March 2021</strong>\n</p>
