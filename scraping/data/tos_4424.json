each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nIn the event of a Dispute, You agree that such Dispute shall be resolved in the following manner:</p>\n<p>1.\nFirst, by direct negotiation between&nbsp;you and our representative with authority to settle the Dispute.&nbsp;The party claiming that there is a Dispute&nbsp;must notify&nbsp;the other party in writing, giving full details of the claim and the specific relief sought (the \u201cDispute Notice\u201d).\nFollowing receipt of the Dispute Notice,&nbsp;our representative shall attempt to contact you by e-mail&nbsp;or telephone to&nbsp;try to resolve the Dispute in good faith within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Dispute Notice.\nAll offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts and attorneys are confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the negotiation.</p>\n<p>2.\nIf the Dispute is not resolved by the foregoing negotiations within thirty (30) days, then the Dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration as follows: (i) if you are a resident of the United States, Canada or Mexico, in&nbsp;Los Angeles, California, under the auspices of JAMS Endispute and in accordance with the rules of JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of these Conditions, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.\nor (ii) if you are a resident of a Member State of the European Union, in London, England, under the auspices of JAMS International, in accordance with the rules of JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures as those Rules exist on the effective date of these Conditions, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules.\nor (iii) if you are a resident elsewhere, in Wellington, New Zealand, under the auspices of New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre.\nJudgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThis clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the rules of JAMS.</p>\n<p>3.\nThe arbitrator shall be appointed by JAMS or by New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre , as applicable, in accordance with its rules.\nThe arbitrator shall serve as neutral, independent and impartial arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator shall be a retired judge or attorney with at least ten (10) years practice advising clients in the internet or e-commerce industry.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nExcept for the initial filing fee if you file a Dispute, we will pay all other filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Dispute Notice is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in U.S.\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b) or corollary statute under the laws of the European Union and New Zealand, as applicable), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the JAMS or New Zealand Dispute Resolution Centre Rules, as applicable.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by us that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable Rules.\nIn any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrator is not empowered to award punitive or exemplary damages, except where permitted by statute, and the parties waive any right to recover any such damages.\nIn any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms of Use, the arbitrator(s) may not award any incidental, indirect or consequential damages, including damages for lost profits.</p>\n<p>4.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</p>\nEntire Agreement.\nSeverability.\nWaiver\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in any applicable End User License Agreement, these Terms of Use constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Sidhe and you regarding the Sites, Games, Products and Content, and

any third party.\nIf any part of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, our original intentions, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.\nOur failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.</p>\nNotices\n<p>You consent to the use of (i) electronic means to complete these Terms of Use and to deliver any notices or other communications permitted or required hereunder and (ii) electronic records to store information related to these Terms of Use or your use of the Sites, Games, Products or Content.\nAny notices or other communications permitted

\u00a7\u00a722575-22579) which require operators of websites to disclose how they respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d (DNT) signals from browsers used by consumers or other mechanisms that provide consumers a choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about the consumer\u2019s online activities over time and across different websites or online services.\nWhile some newer browsers have incorporated \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features which, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked, a DNT protocol that can be implemented across multiple devices and sites has not yet been widely adopted.\nCurrently, our computer system does not support, and cannot act on DNT signal headers that we may receive.\naccordingly, the choices that we provide you concerning out collection and use of personally identifiable information will continue to operate as described in this policy.</p>\n<p>PikPok complies with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nThis was enacted in 2018 and takes effect on January 1, 2020.\nThis landmark piece of legislation secures new privacy
