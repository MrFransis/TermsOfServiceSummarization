NixNet\n<ul>\n<li>About</li>\n<li>Contact</li>\n<li>Blog</li>\n<li>Privacy</li>\n</ul> Privacy Policy\nWhat's being done with your data? <p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> new policies are being drafted that are specific to each service.\nThe policy below generally applies to everything but check the docs for individual policies.\nThis change was made because I know some people only use this or that service and one general blanket policy doesn\u2019t quite cut it.</p>\nPrivacy Policy\n<p>This will hopefully be the briefest \u201clegal\u201d document you\u2019ve ever read as well as the most readable.\nIf you need additional information let me know and I\u2019ll add it.</p>\nIP Address\n<p>Some applications (Gitea, Mumble, XMPP, and NixNet Mail) collect your IP when you register.\nAt the moment, that information is kept indefinitely.\nHowever, I\u2019m working on either completely disabling it or setting something up that will periodically delete stored IP addresses.\nWhen I do, this document will be updated accordingly.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want me to have that information to begin with, just use Tor Browser.</p>\nEmail Address\n<p>When you register for a service using an email address, that is obviously collected.\nYou can control whether it\u2019s a real one or not.\nEven though I can see them for services like Gitea and Mastodon, I don\u2019t care and won\u2019t send you unsolicited mail.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Note:</strong> whatever address you use for git is visible in commits.</p>\nBrowser Fingerprint\n<p>Your web browser communicates uniquely identifying information to all websites it visits by allowing the site to know details about your operating system, browser information, plugins installed, fonts installed, screen resolution, and much more.\nAs far as I know, nothing collects or uses any of that information.</p>\nUsage and storage of collected information\n<p>Whatever data is collected is stored on servers I have sole control over and it won\u2019t be shared with any third parties whatsoever.</p>\nExceptions\n<p>I do live in the US.\nI have two servers here, one in Finland, and another in Luxembourg.\nIf, for whatever reason, I\u2019m compelled by law enforcement to give up your email, IP address, or any other information, I will even though <em>I don\u2019t want to</em>.\nAs such, I do whatever I can to make sure <em>I don\u2019t have that information</em>.\nIf I don\u2019t have it, I can\u2019t share it.</p>\nRecommendations\n<p>To mitigate invasions of privacy like this, use a throwaway email address for registration, such as one from anonbox if you want a temporary address or cock.li for something a bit more permanent.\nAlso provide a fake name and use the service from behind Tor or a VPN.\nRather than a VPN, however, I <em>strongly</em> recommend using Tor across all devices.\nThey have an Android version now and there\u2019s another browser they recommend for iOS called Onion Browser.\nI don\u2019t use iOS so I can\u2019t say whether or not it\u2019s any good, just that the Tor Project recommends it.</p> *****\nWebsite source available on Gitea Made with \u2764\ufe0f and Jekyll by Amolith All content is
