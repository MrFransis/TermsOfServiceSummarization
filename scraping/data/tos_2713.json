you.</p>\n<p>If you use Trumba Services to process the personal information of end users in the EEA or to support your end users (\u201cEnterprise Clients\u201d) in the EEA, you understand and acknowledge that <strong>you</strong> are responsible for providing lawful notice of your own Privacy Policy or an equivalent notice of your privacy practices, in accordance with applicable law, as well as your terms of service on the client calendar, event promotion, and registration tools.</p> 2.\nDescription of Services <p>Trumba provides and hosts for its clients (\u201cClients\u201d) customizable web calendars (the \u201cClient Calendars\u201d), together with event promotion and registration tools (collectively, the \u201cClient Services\u201d).\nClient Calendars may generally be accessed either through the Site or through the Client\u2019s web sites.\nFor Clients in the EEA, Client Calendars may only be accessed through the Client\u2019s web site.\nOn behalf of Clients, Trumba also makes available to Clients\u2019 end-users who access such Client Calendars (\u201cEnd-Users\u201d), online calendar, scheduling, reminder, event registration, event information and publishing, and email and text messaging services (the \u201cEnd-User Services\u201d).\nTogether, the Client Services and the End-User Services shall be referred to as the \u201cServices.\u201d Clients are responsible for establishing and maintaining their own Client Calendar and event information and for the use of their Client Calendars by any person or entity, including their End Users.\nTrumba may impose limits on various calendar or other functions, as it may determine in its sole discretion.\nTrumba may choose, at its sole option and at any time upon notice to Client, not to have certain Client Calendars accessible through the Site.\nIn such event, the Client Calendar shall only be accessible through the Client's web site and will not be searchable.</p>\n<p>Clients have the option of restricting access to Client Calendars through the use of the available privacy settings.\nIf such settings are not utilized, calendars may be publicly accessible and viewed by anyone.\nYou understand and acknowledge that if calendars are not designated as private, they could be accessed, indexed, archived, linked to and republished by others including without limitation search engines.</p>\n<p>End Users may also subscribe to Client Calendars or request event reminders, request or download event information, or request any other action regarding a Client Calendar (each an \u201cEvent Action\u201d), in which case the End User\u2019s email address and other personal information provided in connection with such Event Action may be provided to the publisher of such Client Calendar.\nTrumba shall not be responsible or liable for any third party including End Users, access to Client Calendars or for your or any third party\u2019s use of any Client Calendars.\nAdditional information regarding the Services may be found on the Site, including in the Help Center and FAQ sections of the Site.\nIn the event of any conflict between the information contained on the Site and in these Terms of Use, these Terms of Use shall govern.</p>\n<p>Additionally, as part of the End User Services, Trumba may facilitate an End User\u2019s payment of event registration fees (\u201cRegistration Fees\u201d) on your behalf if you elect to purchase event registration services from Trumba (\u201cRegistration Payment Services\u201d).\nYou acknowledge that Trumba does not collect payments directly from End Users for such Registration Fees, and in connection with such Registration Payment Services, only directs End Users to our authorized third-party payment processors for such processors to collect and process the payment of Registration Fees directly from the End Users.\nTrumba has no obligation with respect to any billing dispute between you and any End User or arising out of or related to the event Registration Payment Services, Registration Fees or payment processing services, and Trumba shall not be responsible for issuing any refunds to any End Users under any circumstances.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, Trumba may, in its discretion, provide features and functionality in the Services in order to assist Client account administrators in collecting and issuing refunds of Registration Fees from you to your End Users.</p> 3.\nRegistration and Subscriptions <p>The Client Services shall only be available upon your registration for a free trial or subscribing to the Client Services and paying in full the applicable subscription fees (the \u201cSubscription Fees\u201d).\nAbsent any agreement to the contrary, the Subscription Fees shall be $99.95 per month, payable in advance.\nFees for event Registration Payment Services (\u201cRegistration Payment Service Fees\u201d) and other services are as set forth on the price list located at the Site and will be specified in each monthly invoice.</p>\n<p>Unless you arrange to be separately invoiced from Trumba and except for Registration Payment Service Fees, you must provide Trumba with a valid credit card for payment of the Subscription Fees and you hereby authorize Trumba to charge the Subscription Fees in advance each month to such credit card until you have cancelled your subscription.\nOnce you have agreed to a plan, then Trumba is authorized to and will automatically charge your credit card for such Subscription Fees in accordance with such plan, unless you have made other payment arrangements.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how frequently you pay Subscription Fees, Registration Payment Service Fees will be invoiced by Trumba within thirty (30) days following the month in which such fees are assessed.\nAll invoices for Registration Payment Service Fees must be paid by you within thirty (30) days of the date of the applicable invoice.\nYou are solely responsible for paying any sales, use or other taxes (except for taxes based on Trumba\u2019s income) for your use of the Services.\nIn the event that the Subscription Fees or Registration Services Fees (collectively, \u201cFees\u201d) are not paid on a timely basis, including due to an invalid credit card number, or you are otherwise in breach of this Agreement, Trumba may, in addition to any other available remedies, suspend or terminate your account as set forth in Section 4.</p>\n<p>Only one individual may access the Service at the same time using the same username and password.\nIn order to register, you must be 18 years of age or older.\nIf children between the ages of 13 and 18 wish to use the site, they must be registered by their parent or guardian.\nBy registering, you represent and warrant that you are over 18 and that all information you provide in the registration form is complete and accurate.\nTrumba reserves the right to refuse service to anyone at any time, with or without cause in its sole discretion.</p>\n<p>In consideration of your use of the Site or the Services, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current and complete information about you as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Site (\u201cRegistration Data\u201d).\n(b) maintain the security of your password and identification.\n(c) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data, and any other information you provide to Trumba, to keep it accurate, current and complete.\nand (d) immediately notify Trumba of any unauthorized use of your account or password or any other breach of security and accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Registration Data and any other information you provide to Trumba.</p> 4.\nChanges to Services.\nTermination <p>Trumba reserves the right at any time, without notice and in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue the Services or to terminate or suspend your account and your license to use this Site, without any liability to you or any other person.\nYou must agree to be bound by any modifications in order to continue using the Services.\nIf you do not agree to the modifications, you must discontinue your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>If for any reason you are not satisfied with the Client Services during the first thirty (30) days after your initial payment of Subscription Fees, you may terminate the Client Services upon written notice prior to the end of such first thirty (30) days and receive a full refund of all Subscription Fees paid.\nYou may terminate your account and your use of the Services at any time by canceling your account from the \u201cAccount Settings\u201d page on the Site, sending us an email to support@corp.trumba.com, or mailing us at the address set forth
