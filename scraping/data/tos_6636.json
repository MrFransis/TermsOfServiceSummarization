www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>\n<p>(c) <u>Cross-device linking</u>.\nPlease note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI\u2019s and DAA\u2019s online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices.\nYou must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>\n<p>(d) <u>Mobile advertising</u>.\nYou may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting \u201climit

cookies.\nIf you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.\nPlease also note that when you opt out of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on our online services.\nIt means that the online ads that you do see from the DAA and NAI program participants should not be based on your interests.\nWe are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties\u2019 opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.\nIn addition, third parties may still use cookies to collect information about your use of our online services, including for analytics and fraud prevention

Agreement/Severability.</strong> This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Render in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Render concerning the Service.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect

the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>No Waiver.</strong> No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of

provision.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact.</strong> Please contact us at legal@render.com with any questions regarding this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>", "created_at": "2022-05-13
