businesses (our \"Customers\") run engaging marketing campaigns that are promoted to customers (\"Campaign Users\").</p>\n<p>Security &amp.\nPrivacy is an important part of our platform that we take very seriously.\nTherefore, this Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Gleam collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a \"User\") of the https://gleam.io website (\"Site\").\nThis privacy policy applies to the Site and all products or services offered by Gleam.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure confidentiality and lawful processing of its, Visitors, Customers and Campaign Users personal data, Gleam in its capacity of a data controller and of a processor, conducts its activities in strict compliance with the requirements set in the Australia Privacy Act 1988, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of this data (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all Customers, Campaign Users and Visitors of our Site and Services.</p> What Information We Collect and How We Use It <p>We may collect the following types of information about you on our Website</p> Customers and Visitors of our Site <p>We may collect your personal data in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when you visit our Site, register on the Site, subscribe to our newsletter, fill out a form, or in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Registration and Contact Information</b>: As appropriate and depending on the Services you would like to use, Customers and Visitors may be asked to provide us with full name, username, email, address, credit card, phone number or billing information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Payment Information</b>: When you purchase the Services, we will also collect transaction information, which

information in accordance with this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by you.</p> Gleam Campaign Users <p>Companies that use Gleam to run campaigns (\"Campaign\") may require Campaign Users to supply certain information as part of a Campaign.\nGleam processes this data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Gleam is a consent based marketing platform, this means that in order for us to process data on behalf of users they must provide it via explicit consent first.\nThis might be as simple as filling out a form or something more complex like connecting Facebook to their Gleam account.</p>\n<p>Gleam also does not collect retain or share end user information including IP addresses, unique user identifiers, or personally identifiable information gathered on sites or apps not owned by Gleam, except for the limited purpose of determining conversion rates &amp.\ndetecting fraud, in which case all personally identifiable information remains anonymous until you explicitly consent by entering a campaign.</p>\n<p>Gleam does not track or provide any personal information to Companies that run Campaigns until you explicitly provide consent.\nThis means that you do not expose any personal information to either Gleam or Companies until you actively participate in their Campaign (even if you are still logged into Gleam or not).</p>\n<p>\n<b>IP Addresses</b>: IP addresses are collected Anonymously (last octet removed) for reporting and usage purposes.\nWhen you consent to a specific campaign your IP address is linked to the associated record and allows

can choose to fill out.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Social Logins</b>: Gleam also allows Campaign Users to connect social accounts to your profile.\nCompanies that have social logins enabled on their Campaigns will

associated with your social accounts</li>\n<li>If you wish to remove the link between Gleam and any social network, you can either remove the Gleam Competitions app inside that specific social network or unlink it from the Edit tab inside the Campaign</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Persistent Logins</b>: Gleam is a distributed platform, which means that if a Campaign User has previously logged into our widget they will continue to stay logged in via third party Cookies across other Campaigns owned by other Companies until they specifically log out.\nThis is designed to make it easy for users to enter more than one campaign without having to re-enter their details again.</p> Cookies <p>Our Site uses both first and third party Cookies to enhance User experience.\nA User's web browser places a cookie on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them.\nUsers may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert when cookies are being

campaigns</li>\n<li>Tracked users referred by our Referral Program</li>\n</ul> Device Fingerprinting <p>Device fingerprinting is a process by which a fingerprint of a device is captured when visiting a website.</p>\n<p>Gleam uses 3rd party services to gather a number of data points from a Gleam Campaign Users computer, such as operating system version, browser version, screen resolution, plug-ins &amp.\nlanguage.\nThis unique ID is then transmitted when Gleam Campaign Users consent by providing their details when entering a campaign.</p>\n<p>The information collected via Device Fingerprinting is used to identify patterns of fraudulent behaviour by Gleam Campaign Users that violate our Terms of Service.\nThis includes trying to cheat by creating multiple accounts, referring your own devices or accounts into a Campaign or attempting to redeem a Reward that is limited to one per person.</p>\n<p>Gleam does not use this information to track or identify users on sites or apps not owned by Gleam or for any other purpose than to detect fraud &amp.\nprotect the integrity of Campaigns, nor do we use the gleam.io or js.gleam.io domains to fingerprint on 3rd party domains.</p> How We Use

use your data once it leaves Gleam.</p>\n<p>To guarantee the legality of any transfer of personal data of EEA or Swiss citizens to sub-processors located outside the EEA or Switzerland, Gleam applies
