real-time.\nThis includes for example AddOnKey, ClientKey, BaseUrl, anonymised TrackingID, error messages and information about the environment such as browser type, browser version and operating system.\nIt is exclusively used in order to improve our service.</p>\n<p>Errors from JavaScript in our cloud applications are sent to Sentry to alert Adaptavist support.\nThe data sent to Sentry includes organisational data but no individual data.\nSentry is running in browser and will diagnose issues.\nIP address is included, and this in theory can be traced to an individual user (and hence may be considered Personal Data).</p>\n<p>In addition, by seeking product support, you may provide log and other information, voluntarily, to our Support staff for analysis and review.\nIt is possible that this can contain Personal Data depending on how you use and configure your products and systems.\nApplication logs may be sent to sub-processors or stored.</p>\n<p>12.2.1\tLog and supplied

detection and alerting data.\nSentry is running in browser and will diagnose issues.\nIP address is included, and this can at times be resolved to an individual, which means it can be Personal

notifications.\n</p>\n<p>12.2.3\tAggregated Diagnostics and Session Data</p>\n<p>This includes data from each customer's use of products which, such as for example usage statistics of product functionality such as the total number of product functions used per day.\nThis data is anonymised.\nTherefore, we cannot identify the end user this data relates to.\n</p>\n<p>Datadog is used for monitoring Synthesized values and metrics such as those outlined above, or CPU usage and requests per second.</p>\n<p>12.2.4\tMetrics</p>\n<p>Application metrics are sent to Datadog for analysis and

Apps such as ScriptRunner for Jira Cloud and ScriptRunner for Confluence Cloud, as well as queries (encrypted), inside our own infrastructure hosted on AWS and managed and operated by Adaptavist.\nThere may be a few exceptions where, for example, select low-risk ScriptRunner Cloud data is still hosted on Jira Cloud (Atlassian) storage.</p>\n<p>\u2022\tBy design there is normally no Personal Data contained in this data category, though an end user may at their choice configure the products otherwise.</p>\n<p>12.4\tData Types: Administrative data</p>\n<p>If you are using our Hosted Services for Atlassian Cloud products, Adaptavist may have access to data available to an administrator based on the specific applications scopes granted (please see

bespoke content production or alterations we make upon your request.</p>\n<p>In addition, Atlassian will have to retain a copy of your contact details and license key of the Atlassian products for their own records, along with any correspondence you may have with them directly.</p>\n<p>12.5\tData Types: Personal Profile Data</p>\n<p>Integrated Partners such as Atlassian have very specific ways of defining Personal Data.\nFor Atlassian, this includes data held in a specific set of tables and for a narrow purpose of logically identifying users.\nSuch data may also be processed by service providers such as AWS Cognito in order to enable profile related product features for Adaptavist offerings.</p>\n<p>This data does not include information which may still resolve to an individual (i.e.\nbe Personal Data within the definition prescribed by the GDPR) and which may be embedded in content throughout various applications.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure we harmonise in certain instances with our Integrated Partners from a policy standpoint, we recognise this distinctive category of data as Personal Profile Data.\n</p>\n<p>12.6\tOn-premises products versus Hosted Services (including
