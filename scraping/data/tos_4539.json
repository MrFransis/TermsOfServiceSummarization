may access your channel subscribers/members to find our players\u2019 accounts to provide them with some in-game customization or goods.\nAny personal data collected from such sources will be stored

policies.\nWhen you play our Console Games, we collect data (such as email) from the gaming platforms on which you play the Console Games, such as Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony

need to process your Personal Data in order to perform the contract with you.\nAs a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to provide you with the Products you request, i.e., to ;allow your installation of the Games, operate the Products and verify and confirm your payments.\n</li>\n<li>to communicate with you about your Account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our Sites or changes to our policies.\n</li>\n<li>to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications.\n</li>\n<li>to arrange your travel, receipt of gifts and awards, to which you may be entitled as a result of winning an offline competition, etc.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1.\nCOMMUNICATION PURPOSES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests to advertise our Products in accordance with this Policy.\nNamely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you personalized marketing emails, messages, targeted in-game and web offers about Games.\nAlso, if you opt-in, we will send you personalized marketing emails, messages and in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.\nIN-GAME OFFERS</strong>\n<br>\nWe will also use the Game-Related Information to send you in-game offers that we believe are most useful to you.\nTo make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify pools of players following the pattern or particular players who follow the pattern.\nTo those players who actually follow the pattern \u2013 we send the in-game offers, which can be personalized (i.e., we want the in-game offer to reach you or a relatively small number of players specifically) or non-personalized (i.e., we want the in-game offer to reach a large number of players following a pattern).\nWe always make sure that such offers have no significant impact on you or our other players.\nFor example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users.\nYou can unsubscribe from personalized in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3.\nPRODUCTS IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We analyse your information to identify how to improve the Products and our operations to make them more suitable and interesting for our players in general.\nWe also may ask you to respond to our Products-related surveys or questionnaires, and you always have the choice about whether to respond to them and which information you provide.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4.\nFRAUD AND EULA VIOLATIONS DETECTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game Rules and policies only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention.\nIf the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5.\nAUDIENCE MATCHING SERVICES</strong>\n</p>\n<p> We will also use your information for audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have used or visited our Products or are identified in one or more of our databases (\u201c<strong>Matched Ads</strong>\u201c).\nThis is done by us sharing a list of hashed emails.\nFor instance, we use Facebook Custom Audiences to serve ads to our players on Facebook and Facebook Lookalike Audiences to serve ads to users on Facebook similar to our players.</p>\n<p>Vendors and ad partners may act as our processors or in certain contexts, they may act as data controllers and independently decide how to process your information.\nWe encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.\nTo opt-out of us sharing your hashed email address for Matched Ads please contact us at privacy@wargaming.net and specify that you wish to opt out of Matched Ads.\nWe will remove your email address from any subsequent lists shared with ad

only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account here or \u2013 for Console Games \u2013 here.\nThis means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here.\nPlease visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.\nIn some cases, for games developed solely by third parties and published by Wargaming on Wargaming Game Center (see section 7(18) above), you can exercise your rights directly from the third-party developer.\nYou may contact us to assist you on how you can exercise your rights for games developed solely by third parties.</p>\n<p> If you have linked your Account with linked services (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Steam, Twitch etc) you may unlink your accounts at any time through the Account Management settings.\nPlease note that unlinking your accounts will not affect any information previously shared through linking.\nWe are not responsible for the data practices of any other parties, and we recommend that you carefully review their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.1.\nOPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool.\nPlease note that even if you unsubscribe from all our personalized marketing emails, messages, in-game and web- offers, we will still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as \u201ctransactional\u201d), e.g.\nto confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, as well as will show to you non-personalized marketing in-game and web offers.\nWe will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted.\nAlso, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone or to a very broad audience and are not specifically directed to you.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of personalized advertising in mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting \u201climit ad tracking\u201d (Apple iOS) or \u201copt-out of interest-based ads\u201d (Android).\nYou can adjust your mobile push notifications in your Android or iOS device settings menu.</p>\n<p>Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests, you can use your right to object at any time.\nIf you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data are necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2.\nRIGHT OF ACCESS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e.\nthe right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained.\nYou can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the \u201cData Export\u201d tool available in the Account Management tools here and \u2013 for Console Games \u2013 here.\nNormally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request.\nOnce the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources.\nIf the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request.\nWe also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Products regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3.\nRIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You control which nickname, email, phone number, country (only in exceptional circumstances), social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account.\nIf they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly.\nPlease inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.4.\nRIGHT TO ERASURE</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our \u201cAccount Deletion\u201d tool available in the Account Management tools here and \u2013 for Console Games \u2013 here.</p>\n<p>As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Products, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Grace period.</strong> We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account.\nThis functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake.\nDuring the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No payments after Account deletion.</strong> As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose the possibility to make payments in the Premium Shop, including during the grace period.\nShould any payment be made after Account deletion due to a technical error or for any other reason, we will refund the amount paid by you and will not grant you the rights to the respective Additional Features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Complicated Account deletion.</strong> In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated.\nNamely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan.\nIn some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Earlier Personal Data deletion.</strong> We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools.\nHowever, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account.\nFor example, we will delete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 45 (forty-five) days after us sending the award to your address.\n</li>\n<li>the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, at onsite events: within no longer than 45 (forty-five) days after completion of the data analysis, data aggregation and generating of the reports for our Products improvement.\n</li>\n<li> technical logs such as records of communication between Products, access logs, errors logs: normally within 45 (forty-five) days after their creation.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information we retain.</strong> Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all your Personal Data, except for the data which are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g.\ntax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations or to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.\nWe will also retain anonymous or de-identified information after your Account has been deleted.\nInformation you have shared with others (e.g.\nthrough in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you have deleted your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control the data that other members/users copied out of our Products.\nGroups content associated with deleted accounts will show an unknown user as the source.\nYour profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g.\nsearch engine results) until they refresh their cache.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>COMPLAINTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p> If you have any issues with our compliance you may contact our Data Protection Officer as set out in section 2 above.\nYou also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nWE CAN CHANGE THIS

to be reflected.\nIf the changes are material, we may provide you additional notice to your email address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA
