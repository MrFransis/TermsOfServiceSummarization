Agreement or that result from your use of or your inability to use the Service or Software, or any other interactions with UltraVPN, even if UltraVPN or an UltraVPN authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>14.2 Limitation of Damages.</strong> In no event will the total liability of UltraVPN or its affiliates, contractors, employees, agents, or third-party partners, licensors, or suppliers to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Service or the

the jurisdiction where you are located.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>(b) Data Transfer.</strong> If you are accessing the Service from any region with laws or regulations governing personal data

Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and UltraVPN in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and UltraVPN agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>15.2 No class actions or jury trials.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\"FAA\"), and not by state law.\nIf you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.\nOther rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.\nYou and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.\nIF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.\nThe arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>15.3 Notice.\nProcess.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\"<strong>Notice</strong>\").\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"<strong>Demand</strong>\").\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or UltraVPN may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or UltraVPN shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nprovided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, UltraVPN shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, or (ii) the greatest amount offered by UltraVPN in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award, whichever is greater.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>15.4 Procedure Generally.</strong> Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (\"<strong>JAMS</strong>\") pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated.\nYou may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com/.\nIf JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.\nThe arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.\nNo arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding.\nYou and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>15.5 Fees.</strong> In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, UltraVPN will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Herndon, Virginia for United States residents, and at a location to be mutually agreed upon for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the

Pango in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Pango agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.\nYou understand and agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Pango are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.2</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>Notwithstanding Section 15.1, you and Pango agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.3 Arbitrator.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>Any arbitration between you and Pango will be conducted in English by a single arbitrator and will be governed by (i) the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), if you are a resident of the United States, or (ii) the Swiss Rules of International Arbitration of the Swiss Chambers\u2019 Arbitration Institution (\u201cSCAI\u201d) in force on the date on which the Notice is submitted, if you are not a resident of the United States, in each case as modified by this Agreement (in either case, the \u201cRules\u201d), and will be administered by, respectively, the AAA in case (i) and the SCAI in case (ii).\nThe Rules and filing forms are available online at, respectively, www.adr.org or 800-778- 7879 (for the AAA), or www.swissarbitration.org or 41 44 217 40 50 (for the SCAI), or by contacting Pango.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.4 Notice.\nProcess.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for You, by electronic mail (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nFor United States residents, Pango\u2019s address for Notice is: Pango Inc., 541 Jefferson Ave, Suite 100, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA.\nFor all other persons, Pango\u2019s address for Notice is: Pango GmbH, Hansmatt 32, 6370 Stans, Switzerland.\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or Pango may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or Pango shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nprovided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Pango shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, or (ii) the greatest amount offered by Pango in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.5 Fees.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Pango will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California for United States residents, and at a location to be agreed upon in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Pango for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.6 No class actions.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>You and Pango agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\nFurther, unless both you and Pango agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.7 Enforceability.</strong> If Section 15.6 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void.\n</p>\n<strong>16.\nMiscellaneous.</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>16.1 Notice.</strong> Pango may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to this Agreement, by posting the notice through the Service.\nNotice will be deemed given twenty-four hours after posting.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.2 Waiver.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>The failure of Pango to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nAny waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by Pango.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.3 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law except payments disputes filed by customer\u2019s domiciled in the European Community or Switzerland will be treated according to Swiss law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.4 Jurisdiction.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>You agree that in the event of a dispute that is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 15, or if Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating in any way to, this Agreement or Pango will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, and You hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.5 Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.6 Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Pango without restriction.\nAny assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.7 Survival.</strong> Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, the following provisions will survive such termination or expiration: Sections 4.2, 5.3, and 10 through 16.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.8 Headings.</strong> The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of the terms of this Agreement, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.9 Entire Agreement.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Pango relating to the subject matter herein and will not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.10 Time Limit for Claims.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>You and Pango agree that any cause of action arising out of

Arbitration</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>15.1 Generally.\n</strong>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Aura in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Aura agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.2 No class actions or jury trials.\n</strong>This Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\u201cFAA\u201d), and not by state law.\nIf you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.\nOther rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.\nYou and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.\nIF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.\nThe arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.3</strong>\n<strong>Notice.\nProcess.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201d).\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Aura may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Aura shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.4</strong>\n<strong>Procedure Generally.</strong> Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated.\nYou may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com/.\nIf JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.\nThe arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.\nNo arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding.\nYou and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.5 Fees.\n</strong>In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Aura will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Herndon, Virginia for United States residents, and at a location to be mutually agreed upon for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Aura for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.6 Enforceability.\n</strong>If Section 15.2 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void.\nIf any portion of this Arbitration Agreement other than the class action waiver and prohibition against class arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment or default of your obligations under this Agreement, and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law).\nYOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, BUT YOU MUST EXERCISE THIS RIGHT PROMPTLY.\nIf you do not wish to be bound by this agreement to arbitrate, You must notify us in writing within sixty (60) days after the date you agree to this Agreement.\nYou must send your request to: Aura Customer Service, P.O.\nBox 222455, Chantilly, VA 20153-2455.\nThe request must include your full name, address, account number, and the statement \u201cI reject the Arbitration Agreement contained in the Terms of Use for my Aura Service.\u201d If you exercise your right to reject arbitration, the other terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as if you had not rejected arbitration.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong> Miscellaneous.</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>16.1 Assignment.\n</strong>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Aura without restriction.\nAny assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.2 Entire Agreement.\n</strong>This Agreement (including any documents incorporated here by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Aura concerning its subject matter, and it supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms, written or oral.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.3&nbsp.\nForce Majeure.\n</strong>Neither Aura nor you will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, internet disturbance, strikes, riots, pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism, and governmental action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.4 Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the

interpretation of particular provisions.\nThe use of the words \"includes,\" \"including,\" \"such as,\" \"for example,\" and similar terms are deemed not to limit what else might be included.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.6 Jurisdiction.\n</strong>You agree that in the event of a dispute that is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 15, or if Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or Aura will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the Herndon, Virginia, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.7 Notice.</strong> All notices must be in

details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.8 Severability.\n</strong>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.9 Survival.&nbsp.\n</strong>Upon

available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.\nYou and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through

REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.\nThe arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<b>15.3 Notice.\nProcess.</b> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail <b>(\u201cNotice\u201d)</b>.\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought <b>(\u201cDemand\u201d)</b>.\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Aura may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Aura shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>\n<p>\n<b>15.4 Procedure Generally.</b>&nbsp;Arbitrations shall be administered by

fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com/.\nIf JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.\nThe arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.\nNo arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding.\nYou and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not

is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Herndon, Virginia for United States residents, and at a location to be mutually agreed upon for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Aura for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<b>15.6 Enforceability.</b>&nbsp;If Section 15.2 above is found to be

fullest extent permitted by law: <ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, will Aura or the Aura Entities be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages (including without limitation damages arising from any unsuccessful court action or legal dispute, lost business, lost revenues, or loss of anticipated profits or any other pecuniary or non-pecuniary loss or damage of any nature whatsoever) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or that result from your use of or your inability to use the Service or Software, or any other interactions with Aura, even if Aura or an Aura authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limitation of Damages.</strong> In no event will the total liability of Aura or its affiliates, contractors, employees, agents, or third-party partners, licensors, or

Arbitration</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Generally.</strong> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Aura in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Aura agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>No class actions or jury trials.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\u201cFAA\u201d), and not by state law.\nIf you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.\nOther rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.\nYou and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.\nIF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.\nThe arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notice.\nProcess.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (<strong>\u201cNotice\u201d</strong>).\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (<strong>\u201cDemand\u201d</strong>).\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Aura may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Aura shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nprovided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Aura shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, or (ii) the greatest amount offered by Aura in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award, whichever is greater.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Procedure Generally.</strong> Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (\u201cJAMS\u201d) pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated.\nYou may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com/.\nIf JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.\nThe arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.\nNo arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding.\nYou and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fees.</strong> In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Aura will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Herndon, Virginia for United States residents, and at a location to be mutually agreed upon for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Aura for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Enforceability.</strong> If Section 15.2 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong> Miscellaneous</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Assignment.</strong> This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Aura without restriction.\nAny assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement (including any documents incorporated here by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Aura concerning its subject matter, and it supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms, written or oral.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither Aura nor you will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, internet disturbance, strikes, riots, pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism, and governmental action.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, exclusive of its choice of law principles.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interpretation.</strong> This Agreement was prepared and written in English.\nAny non-English translations of this Agreement which may be made available are provided for convenience only and are not valid or legally binding.\nUse of section headings in this Agreement is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions.\nThe use of the words \"includes,\" \"including,\" \"such as,\" \"for example,\" and similar terms are deemed not to limit what else might be included.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Jurisdiction.</strong> You agree that in the event of a dispute that is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 15, or if Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or Aura will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the Herndon, Virginia, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notice.</strong> All notices must be in writing and will be deemed given when: (a) personally delivered, (b) verified by written receipt, if sent by postal mail with verification of receipt service or courier, (c) received, if sent by postal mail without verification of receipt, or (d) verified by automated receipt or electronic logs if sent by email, provided that no bounce or other technical error message was received in response.\nNotices to Aura must be sent to Intersections Inc.\ndba Aura at 2553 Dulles View Drive, Suite 400, Herndon, VA 20171, marked to the attention of the Legal Department, with a copy emailed to legalnotices@aura.com.\nEmail is insufficient for providing non-routine legal notices such as indemnification claims, breach notices, and termination notices (<strong>\u201cNon-Routine Notices\u201d</strong>) to Aura.\nYou may grant approvals, permission, extensions and consents by email.\nNotices to you may be sent to the email address associated with your account for the Service.\nYou consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us in connection with your use of the Service.\nYou agree that any notices or other communications sent to you electronically will satisfy any legal notice requirements.\nYou must keep contact details associated with your account and accurate, and you will notify Aura in writing of any changes to such details.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Survival.</strong> Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, the following provisions will survive such termination or expiration: Sections 4, 5.3, and 10 through 16.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> There are no third party beneficiaries to this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver.</strong> The failure of Aura to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nAny waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by Aura.\nAny cause of action arising out of or related to the Service by you against Aura must commence within 1 year after the cause of action accrues.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Apple App Store Additional License

purposes described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide, maintain, troubleshoot, and support our services.</strong> We use your information for this purpose on the basis that it is required to fulfill our contractual obligations to you.\nExamples: using information about how much bandwidth you use and how long you use our services in order to provide the services in accordance with a plan to which you have subscribed.\nusing threat and device information to determine whether certain items pose a potential security threat.\nand using usage information to\ntroubleshoot a problem you

perform\nbilling administration activities and process payments, which are required to\nfulfill our contractual obligations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To communicate with users and prospective\nusers.\n</strong>We use your information to communicate with you, including by responding to your requests, and sending you information and updates about our services.\nWe may do\nthis in order to fulfill our contract with you, because you consented to the\ncommunication, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with\ninformation about our services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To improve our services.\n</strong>We want to offer you the best services and\nuser experiences we can, so we have a legitimate interest in continually\nimproving and optimizing our services.\nTo do so, we use your information to\nunderstand how users interact with our services.\nExamples: we analyze certain\nusage, device, and diagnostic information to understand aggregated usage trends\nand user engagement with our services (and, for example, invest in technical\ninfrastructure to better serve regions with increasing user demand).\nwe may use\ndevice and threat information to conduct spam, threat, and other scientific\nresearch to improve our threat detection capabilities.\nwe review customer\nfeedback to understand what we could be doing better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To develop new services.</strong> We have a legitimate interest in using\nyour information to plan for and develop new services.\nFor

that our VPN products do not use your VPN browsing activity for these\npurposes and we do not maintain any records that show what you were browsing or\naccessing through a VPN connection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To prevent harm or liability.\n</strong>We may use information for security\npurposes (such as to investigate security issues or to monitor and prevent\nfraud) and to prevent abuse.\nWe may do this to comply with our legal\nobligations, to protect an individual\u2019s vital interests, or because we have a\nlegitimate interest in preventing harm or liability to Aura and our users.\nFor\nexample, we may use account, usage, and device information to determine if an\nentity is engaging in abusive or unauthorized activity in connection with our\nservices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For legal compliance.\n</strong>We internally use your information as\nrequired by applicable law, legal process, or regulation.\nTo learn about our\npractices regarding <i>sharing</i> your\ninformation with third parties for legal compliance purposes, see Section 3.1\nbelow.\nWe also use your information to enforce our legal rights and resolve\ndisputes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3.\nWho do we share your information with and why?</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>3.1.\nIn General</strong>\n<p>\nWe may disclose your information in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>In accordance with your instructions or consent.</strong>\nFor example, some services may allow you to register an account using a third\nparty account (such as a Google or Microsoft account).\nIf you choose to do so,\nwe will share information with the third party account provider.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To your business organization (for our\nbusiness services).</strong> If a business customer is providing you with access to our services\nthrough a business account, others in that organization may be able to see and\nmanage your account and the information associated with it (such as an\nadministrator).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For collaborating with others.\n</strong>Some services may provide ways for\ndifferent users to interact or collaborate with each other.\nYour information\nwill be shared in connection with those activities if you choose to engage in\nthem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Affiliates and third party service providers.\n</strong>To\nhelp us provide some aspects of our services, we work with trusted third\nparties and partners (including affiliated companies in the Aura group).\nTo\nprotect your data, we enter into appropriate confidentiality and data\nprocessing terms with these third parties, review their security practices, and\nlimit information sharing to the scope of what they are helping us with.\nExamples of activities that third parties help us with include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>processing customer payments</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>providing analytics about our services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>providing sales and customer support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>maintaining the infrastructure required to provide our services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>delivering our marketing and advertising content</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For security research purposes.</strong> A sanitized subset of our threat\nintelligence data may be shared with selected reputable members of the\ncybersecurity industry for the purpose of security threat research and\nfacilitating community efforts to improve online security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To a new owner.</strong> If ownership or control of all or part of\nour services, assets, or business changes, we may transfer your information to\nthe new owner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated or de-identified data.</strong> We may use and share aggregated data and\ndata that is de-identified such that it no longer reveals the identity of an\nindividual user for regulatory compliance, research and analysis, our own\nmarketing and advertising activities and other legitimate business purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To comply with legal process and the law.</strong> We are fiercely protective of the privacy\nof our users.\nIf you use our VPN products, we protect your privacy by ensuring\nthat we do not log or record online activities that you conduct over a VPN\nconnection in any way that can be tied back to you, meaning that we do not have\nany data to share with law enforcement and government agencies who make\nrequests for information about what you were doing through a VPN connection.\nSubject to the foregoing, we may share your information if we are required to\ndo so by applicable law.\nto comply with our legal obligations.\nto comply with\nlegal process.\nand to respond to valid law enforcement requests relating to a\ncriminal investigation, or alleged or suspected illegal activity that may\nexpose Aura, you, or any of our other users to legal liability.\nIf we share\nyour information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is\nlegally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are\nunlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To enforce our rights and prevent fraud and abuse.</strong>\nWe may share limited amounts of your information to enforce and administer our\nagreements with customers and users, and to respond to claims asserted against\nAura.\nWe may also share your information in order to protect against fraud and\nabuse against Aura, our affiliates, users and others.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3.2.\nFree Products Only</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Displaying Ads.</strong> We do not display third party ads in our paid products.\nWith respect to our free mobile apps and other free products, we may serve ads to users in certain regions.\nAlthough the money we make from displaying these ads offsets only part of the costs of making these apps and services available for free, we provide free apps because we believe it\u2019s important that everyone has the opportunity, regardless of their situation, to\nhave secure and private access to the internet.</p>\n<p>The ads we display in our services are supplied either by advertisers\nor affiliate networks we have relationships with, or by Google, a third party\nadvertising network (\u201c<strong>Google Ads</strong>\u201d).\nTo display these ads in our apps, we may integrate into them a software development kit (SDK), which consists of software code provided by a third party, such as an ad network.</p>\n<p>We do not provide Google Ads with any personal data about you, except\nfor an approximate city-level latitude and longitude which lets them show ads\nwhich are more relevant for your approximate geographic location.\nHowever,\nGoogle Ads may collect information through their SDKs, such as your mobile\nadvertising identifier, IP address, and device information, for the purpose of\nserving you with \u201cpersonalized\u201d ads (ads that they think are more relevant to\nyou) and measuring your response to those ads.\nIf you are using a VPN\nconnection, your IP address is hidden from ad networks and replaced with the IP\naddress of our VPN servers.\nBecause we do not provide ad networks with personal\ndata about you (apart from city-level location), Google Ads personalizes ads\nbased on information that they collect from you and that they already have\nabout you - not based on information we share with them.</p>\n<p>Google collects this information according to the Google advertising privacy notice.\nWhere an AdChoices logo appears on an ad,\nyou can click it to learn more about the ad network that provided the ad, its\nprivacy policy, and your choices regarding opting out from any personalized\nadvertising.\nIf you opt out from personalized advertising, you may still see\nnon-personalized ads.</p>\n<p>While we request you not to use ad blockers to prevent the display of\nads because that is how we support our free services, our services are able to\ncontinue functioning if you do use ad blockers.</p>\n<strong>4.\nTracking Technologies &amp.\nCookies</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>4.1.\nAbout Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>Aura uses various technologies in

kits are software code provided by our\nbusiness partners that let our software interact with the services those\npartners provide.\nFor example, in our free mobile apps, we may use an SDK to\nenable our app to serve ads from an advertising network.\nSometimes these\ninteractions will involve that business partner collecting some information\nfrom the device on which the software is run.</p>\n<strong>4.2.\nWhy we use Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>We use tracking technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide our services.</strong> Some cookies are essential for the

partners use these technologies for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide our services.</strong> Some business partners who help us to\nprovide our services may use these

audiences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To Serve Ads.</strong> This is relevant to users of our free\nproducts only.\nAd networks and affiliate networks may use these technologies to\ndisplay ads which they think will be more relevant to you.\nFor more\ninformation, please see the \u201cDisplaying Ads\u201d section above.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4.4.\nYour

personal data is an important aspect of protecting privacy.\nAura employs a\nrange of administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards\ndesigned to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or\nmodification.\nWe endeavor to use reasonably available state-of-the-art network\nand information security standards, protocols and technologies, including\nencryption,

Economic Area (EEA) may be\ntransferred and processed outside Switzerland or the EEA for purposes described\nin this policy.\nHowever, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to\nensure that
