Notes use for daily operation?</i> to learn more about the services we use.</p>\n<p>On our guest-facing website only (the site you're reading this on, standardnotes.org), we use a self-hosted, privacy-focused analytics suite known as Matomo, which anonymizes IP addresses.</p>\n<p>When you sign up for a free notes account, an email is required.\nUpon registration, you will receive 1 welcome email from us.\nAt the bottom of that email, you will have the option to permanently unsubscribe from future emails, or decrease your email level.</p>\n<p>You may choose to anonymize your email during registration, however, this is not recommended, as we will not be able to provide you with support on this account.</p>\n<p>You may choose to have your account deleted.\nUpon doing so, all information related to your account is permanently deleted from our production database.\nWe maintain 14 day backups of our databases.\nAfter the 14 day period, no trace of your information will remain on our system.</p>\n<p>When you make a change to a note or other data item using our applications, your data is first encrypted offline on your device using your secure key, then synced to our server.\nOur server cannot read the contents of the note.\nIt can however read the date the item was created and modified, the content type of the item (whether it is a note or tag), and the user agent used to modify the item (which browser and version, etc.\nnon-personally identifiable.\nused for debugging).</p>\n<p>When you access any of our web services (syncing, website, extensions), your network request goes through our AWS-based firewall.\nTo prevent spamming and abuse, the firewall limits requests per IP address to a set amount over a 5-minute period.\nThis means that IP addresses are necessarily remembered by AWS temporarily up to 5 minutes to determine if an IP is abusive, before resetting this information.\nOtherwise, IP addresses are never stored in long-term logs.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n", "created_at": "2020-01-08 20:57:45.11649", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 23:49:02.168575"}, {"id": 2315, "name": "Our Privacy Manifesto", "url": "https://standardnotes.org/privacy", "xpath": "/html/body/div/div/section/div", "text": "\nOur Privacy Manifesto\n<p>\nWe believe the Internet should do a simple thing: Keep your private information private.\nNo one should be able to touch what you think or write and do, but you.\nAnd we are out to prove that far too many companies mismanage your information for no other reason than laziness and greed.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe will never ask you to take our word for protecting your privacy by burying lax standards in user agreements carefully crafted so nobody understands them.\nInstead, we will proudly present peer review and auditable privacy policies that the entire world can see, touch and debate.\n</p>\n<p>Here's how we do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>End to End Privacy:</strong>\nAll your data \u2014 no matter if you\u2019re using a PC, a phone, a tablet or a gaming system \u2014 is encrypted everywhere you\n<i>don't control.</i>\nOn our servers.\nOn our network.\nOn a public network.\nIn the cloud.\nOn mars.\nWhenever your information moves anywhere away from your direct control,\nit will be seriously encrypted with a passcode that no one else in the world knows but you.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Secure connections.</strong>\nWhenever we move your encrypted data over a network, in order to deliver services to you, it is sent over a strictly secure connection to only our private servers.\nBecause this data is encrypted, we can't read it, and we can\u2019t sell it.\nEven if someone forced their way into our data centers,\nyour data would be complete gibberish to them.\nForever.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Open-source:</strong>\nWe've made all our code open-source, so it's clear how your data is being handled every step of the way.\nMany companies promise encryption but don't open up their code for peer-review.\nWe believe the definition of end-to-end encryption\nshould mean that code on both ends is open-sourced.\nWhile trust in a closed system can be convenient at times, nothing is more trustable than mathematical certainty and utter transparency.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>No tracking or intrusive advertising.</strong>\nWe are heavily opposed to industry standard tracking tools like Google Analytics, which gathers and analyzes your browsing history to sell you better advertisements.\nInstead, we use an open-source, privacy-focused, and self-hosted Matomo analytics installation.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Respectful analytics.</strong>\nWe are utterly and completely transparent about reporting exactly what we track, and why.\nWe announce when we update those policies.\nAnd we confirm with you that you are comfortable with those changes.\nTo date, our applications, including web, desktop, and mobile, contain no analytics or tracking software whatsoever.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nIf you have any questions or concerns whatsoever, please don't hesitate to get in
