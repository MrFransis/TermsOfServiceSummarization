to&nbsp;process it.\nYou also have&nbsp;the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have&nbsp;successfully exercised your right to object to&nbsp;processing (see below), where we&nbsp;may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to&nbsp;erase your personal data to comply&nbsp;with local law.\nNote, however, that we may&nbsp;not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal&nbsp;reasons which will be notified&nbsp;to you, if applicable, at the time of your&nbsp;request.<br>\n<br>\nObject to the processing&nbsp;of&nbsp;your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a&nbsp;third party) and there is something about your&nbsp;particular situation which makes&nbsp;you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your&nbsp;fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou&nbsp;also have the right to object where we are&nbsp;processing

need to verify&nbsp;whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.<br>\n<br>\nRequest the transfer&nbsp;of&nbsp;your personal data to you or to a third party.<br>\n<br>\nWithdraw consent at any time&nbsp;where&nbsp;we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not&nbsp;affect the lawfulness of any&nbsp;processing carried out before you withdraw

the other rights).&nbsp;However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded,&nbsp;repetitive or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may&nbsp;refuse to comply with your request&nbsp;in these circumstances.&nbsp;We may need to request specific&nbsp;information from you to help us confirm your identity and&nbsp;ensure your right to&nbsp;access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security&nbsp;measure to ensure that personal data is not&nbsp;disclosed to any person who has no&nbsp;right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information&nbsp;in relation to your request to speed&nbsp;up our response.<br>\n<br>\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.&nbsp;Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly&nbsp;complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you&nbsp;and keep you updated.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>
