"/html/body/main/div/section/div/div", "text": " Codes of Conduct <strong>Updated: April 2, 2021</strong>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Welcome to NaNoWriMo!</strong> This is a unique community that exists to support you through all aspects of the writing process, provide a home for any discussion that comes to mind, and help you find like-minded individuals.\nLike any public place, we need the community\u2019s help to make this a welcoming, diverse, and inclusive space for people, from lurkers to the most involved participant!</p>\n<p>Here are some guidelines to help make your community experience a great one.<br>\n</p>\n<strong>Codes of Conduct</strong>\n<strong>Our Intention</strong>\n<p>Our goal is to foster and steward a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community for writers and the discussions that are important to them.\nOur vision is to create a thoughtful and generous community of people that trust and care about each other, are curious about others and the world around them, and are dedicated to growing as writers.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Building a Diverse and Inclusive Community</strong>\n<p>We celebrate and welcome diversity of all races, genders, sexualities, religions, and countries of origin.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Hate speech is not allowed.</strong> If any post contributes to the marginalization of another writer, whether through racist, sexist, ableist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, ageist, fatphobic, classist, or other bigoted language, we will remove that post and/or poster.\n<strong>Purposeful and/or violent hate speech will result in an immediate ban</strong> from our website and forums.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please remain open to education.</strong> If you accidentally say something hurtful, fighting the instinct to be defensive often helps others respond with constructive feedback.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please respect our affinity groups.</strong> Don\u2019t apply to join a private affinity group if you do not match the criteria for that group.\nIn public affinity forums (like our age-based forums), if you don\u2019t share the identity of that group, please behave as a guest and follow the lead of those who do share that identity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consider adding your pronouns to your user profile.</strong> This will help others know how to correctly address you, and will also make sharing pronouns feel easier for everybody!</p>\n<p>You can view NaNoWriMo\u2019s values and action on diversity, equity, and inclusion here.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Content and Trigger Warnings</strong>\n<p>Use content and trigger warnings thoughtfully.\nIt\u2019s respectful and helpful to include trigger or content warnings when you\u2019re dealing with sensitive topics.\nThis can include (but is not limited to) sexual content of any kind, abuse, torture, murder, violence, self-harm, disordered eating, suicide, and child abuse/neglect.\nWe often write about these things, and that\u2019s okay! What we ask is that you be mindful of those participants who may find these things triggering, traumatic, or simply don\u2019t want to be included in that discussion.</p>\n<p>If someone asks that you include a warning, please do so.\nIt\u2019s not our place to determine what is \u201cvalid\u201d enough to include a warning! Ignoring a request for a warning will result in post removal and a 24-hour mute.\nThose who continue to post sensitive content and ignore requests to include warnings will be removed from the group.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not sure\u2026 err on the side of caution or ask a mod!<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<strong>Abuse and Bullying</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Any interaction or conflict that becomes abusive, mean-spirited, or threatening is unacceptable.</strong> In most circumstances, we\u2019ll send a warning to any member found in violation of these conditions.\nSubsequent violations can result in sanctions on your account without warning.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Violent and Sexually Explicit Content</strong>\n<p>If you are posting potentially triggering or sensitive content in public spaces (regional spaces, event/write-in descriptions and spaces, forums), be respectful and include trigger or content warnings.\nOn the forums, please make sure you are posting to the appropriate forums for your topic.</p>\n<p>If you wish to share a writing excerpt that\u2019s explicit or violent, please link to it elsewhere rather than posting it directly.\nadult content is easier to opt into when it\u2019s a link.</p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure if your contribution counts as explicit, err on the side of caution.\nAsk a moderator if you\u2019re not sure or need clarification about what\u2019s appropriate.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Improve the Discussion</strong>\n<p>Help us make this a great place for discussion by working to improve the discussion in some way, however small.\nIf you are not sure your contribution adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.</p>\n<p>The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too.\nBe respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.</p>\n<p>One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening.\nSpend time browsing the topics/conversation before replying or starting your own, and you\u2019ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.\nRead &amp.\nrespond.\nThe best part of the community is the interaction.\nPlease remember to read on our site as much as you post!<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Conspiracies and Misinformation</strong>\n<p>NaNoWriMo will not provide a platform for any conspiracy theories.\nDiscussion of them is one thing: we\u2019re not pretending they don\u2019t exist and wielding an indiscriminate banhammer.\nWhat we will not tolerate is the promotion of those ideas.\nIf we determine that a statement on our site encourages and promotes a harmful and unfactual theory, we will err on the side of caution and remove it.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Engage with Others in Good Faith</strong>\n<p>Disagreement is often necessary to learn and grow as a community! When engaging in a disagreement with others you believe are acting in good faith, focus on criticizing ideas instead of people.\nPlease avoid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name-calling</li>\n<li>Ad-hominem attacks</li>\n<li>Responding to a post\u2019s tone instead of its actual content</li>\n<li>Knee-jerk contradiction</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you suspect that another person in our community is engaging in bad faith (by trolling, sea-lioning, or otherwise engaging without consideration of other people\u2019s humanity and without the intention to grow themselves or our community), please flag their posts and/or call in moderators or other staff as needed.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Your Participation Counts</strong>\n<p>The conversations we have here set the tone for every new arrival.\nHelp us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make NaNoWriMo an interesting place to be \u2014 and avoiding those that do not.</p>\n<p>In the forums, Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth.\nUse these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else\u2019s, too.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s leave our community better than we found it.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>If You See a Problem, Report It</strong>\n<p>When you see bad behavior, don\u2019t reply.\nIt encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone\u2019s time.\nIf you\u2019re on the forums, just flag it.\nIf enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.\nIf you see bad behavior on our site outside of the forums, take a screenshot and email our staff at tickets@nanowrimo.uservoice.com.</p>\n<p>In order to maintain our community, moderators and staff reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time.\nOur team does not preview new content from users.\nthe moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Strive to Be Generous with Your Fellow Writers</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Do not correct someone\u2019s grammar unless requested to do so.</strong> This may be a writing group, but no one is expected to have perfect grammar all the time.\nMany participants are non-native English speakers, neurodivergent, or disabled.\nIf you aren\u2019t asked to help with grammar, don\u2019t volunteer your services unsolicited.\nEngage with the content of what the person is sharing, rather than the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of their phrasing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Don\u2019t cause harm to each other.</strong> Don\u2019t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.\nPersonal conflicts should not be aired on the forums.\nThe forums are a place for conversations between many different people.\nWe have a private messaging system that is perfectly suited for conversations just between two people.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Respect our discussion.</strong> Don\u2019t post spam or otherwise vandalize our conversation spaces.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Take a break when you need to.</strong> If conversations get heated, consider taking a break before making your next response.\nDon\u2019t feel the need to respond immediately.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Ignore cheaters and trolls.</strong> Every year, we get dozens of posts accusing others of cheating at NaNoWriMo.\nPlease\u2014don\u2019t worry about cheaters.\nNaNoWriMo is an honor-system challenge.\nno one is cheating anyone but themselves if they don\u2019t write the novel they said they wrote.<br>\nIf you see a post that you suspect is a troll (i.e.\nsomeone posting something deliberately inflammatory just to get a rise out of people), please do not engage them.\nJust let it go, they\u2019ll move along without any feedback.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Site and Forum Guidelines</strong>\n<strong>\u2600\ufe0f All-ages Spaces</strong>\n<p>Be aware that all public spaces on the website, including the regional spaces and event/write-in spaces, are all-ages.</p>\n<p>Many of our forums are all-ages forums (these will display a sun icon, and currently include #coffeehouse, #newbies, and all #regions.)</p>\n<p>We have many teenagers who frequent our site, and while we don\u2019t expect you to be perfect angels everywhere, we do ask that you maintain a family-friendly tone (no foul language) in all-ages spaces.\nIf you have questions about what is and isn\u2019t permitted, just ask a moderator, or use the help forums for trickier questions.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Permitted Content</strong>\n<strong>Post Only Your Own Content</strong>\n<p>You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission.\nYou may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone\u2019s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.\nYou may not expose any other person\u2019s personal information.</p>\n<strong>Profanity Guidelines</strong>\n<p>Profanity is not allowed in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nUsernames</li>\n<li>Regional landing pages and their chat spaces</li>\n<li>Event/write-in descriptions and spaces</li>\n<li>Forums subject lines</li>\n<li>Any content posted to an all-ages forum.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Outside of all-ages forums, profanity is permitted provided it isn\u2019t being used abusively.</p>\n<strong>User Avatar Guidelines</strong>\n<p>Only images considered \u201csafe for all ages\u201d are appropriate for your author picture.\nDon\u2019t use nudity, profanity, or violent imagery in user pictures, as they may appear in all-ages friendly places on our website and in the forums (which includes regional landing pages).<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Sharing Your Work</strong>\n<p>You\u2019re free to write whatever you want in your writing projects: any subject, any characters, and any language.\nYou are under no obligation to show it to anyone, including us.\nYou don\u2019t even have to talk about what you\u2019re writing!</p>\n<p>You can post a summary and short excerpt of your writing project on the website.\nYou\u2019re also welcome to post short (1500 words or less) excerpts of your work in the appropriate forums.\nPlease remember that your writing project details are visible to all participants on our website unless you change your privacy settings, or are posting in non-public forums.</p>\n<p>We prohibit posting violent and/or sexually explicit content directly to our website and forums.\nIf you want to share your explicit fiction, we encourage you to post that writing offsite and include a link with appropriate warnings.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Keep the Forums Tidy</strong>\n<p>Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Start topics in the right category.</strong> We will move miscategorized topics and posts, but help us by making sure!
