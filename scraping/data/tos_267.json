Associate.\nAs its standard offering, SpiderOak One and Groups provides a cloud backup and storage system that complies with both the Privacy Rule and Security Rule.\nCrossClave is a file sharing and collaboration tool with real-time chat that complies with both the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule.\nSemaphor is a chat tool for real-time conversations and file-sharing that also complies with both the Privacy Rule and Security Rule.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>SpiderOak supports certain customers that are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations as amended by the regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, Title XIII of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d).\nUnder HIPAA, companies have obligations to meet certain privacy and security standards with regard to Protected Health Information (\u201cPHI\u201d).</p>\n<p>In order to comply with HIPAA, Covered Entities, which are defined in the HIPAA rules to include: (1) health plans, (2) healthcare clearinghouses, and (3) healthcare providers who electronically transmit any health information in connection with transactions for which Health &amp.\nHuman Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) has adopted standards, must act in an effort to ensure that patient information is both private and secure.\nTo guide organizations in fulfilling their HIPAA obligations, HHS has published what are commonly known as the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Security Rule.\nThe \u201cPrivacy Rule,\u201d or Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, establishes national standards for keeping certain health information confidential.\nThe Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information (the \u201cSecurity Rule\u201d) establish a national set of security standards for keeping certain health information secure while it is being held or transferred in electronic form.</p>\n<p>Organizations that act in support of Covered Entities, as defined in HIPAA, are \u201cBusiness Associates.\u201d Cloud storage providers, such as SpiderOak, that support Covered Entities through the storage of PHI are Business Associates.</p>\n<p>The latest update to HIPAA requires, among others, healthcare providers, medical institutions, and cloud storage services supporting those entities where PHI is involved to be compliant with HIPAA rules and regulations.\nIf they are found not to be in compliance, they may have to pay fines up to $1.5 million dollars.\nIn order to comply with HIPAA, cloud service providers have to enforce stringent security policies for protecting the privacy and confidentiality of user data.</p>\n<p>With its No Knowledge privacy approach, the SpiderOak One desktop, CrossClave desktop and mobile, and Semaphor desktop and mobile applications encrypt the data on the user\u2019s device before uploading the data to the cloud or syncing it across other devices.\nThe data remains encrypted until the user requests the data, which is then delivered back to the user\u2019s computer in its encrypted state until the user decrypts it with the password.</p>\n<p>Because the SpiderOak One, CrossClave, and Semaphor desktop applications store user data in encrypted form, it also provides the highest degree of protection against security breaches.\nWhen sensitive information is stored in plaintext form, there is always a risk of data being compromised during cyber attacks, resulting in compliance violations.\nEven if unauthorized personnel are able to access the server, all they can see is encrypted, unintelligible data.</p>\n<p>You can find more information about how to request a SpiderOak Business Associate Agreement here.\nFor any inquiries regarding PHI, HIPAA, security, privacy, please contact compliance@spideroak.com, Attn: HIPAA Compliance.</p>\n<p>To learn more about how to get your team set up on CrossClave for Enterprise, please contact our enterprise sales team at sales@spideroak-inc.com.</p>", "created_at": "2021-06-25

methodologies, the Company does not have plaintext access to any data a user uploads through the SpiderOak application.\nFor account purposes, we do have access to the account details collected upon account creation including name, email address, and username.\nFurther details include account type, date of account creation/deletion, account history, last 4 digits of credit card (if applicable) and billing address (if applicable).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>WHAT PRINCIPLES DOES SPIDEROAK BELIEVE IN UPHOLDING?<p>We at SpiderOak believe that everyone has a right to privacy.\nGiven this benchmark, we ensure any request for information from law enforcement has proper authority and verification.\nWe very much view this level of scrutiny and observance as our responsibility and will follow all measures available to us to ensure proper procedure is being followed.</p>\n<p>SpiderOak provides user information in response to law enforcement requests only in the event that SpiderOak is required to do so by law.\nRegarding non-public user information, SpiderOak requires that law enforcement must provide the proper and correct legal documents required to obtain information (e.g.\na subpoena, court order, or warrant).\nSpiderOak investigates all requests to ensure they comply with the law.</p>\n<p>It is SpiderOak policy to provide notice to a user about any law enforcement request unless prohibited from doing so by law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>HOW DOES SPIDEROAK RESPOND TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST?<p>Requests seeking user information must refer to a specific user account by an email address or username associated with the user\u2019s SpiderOak account.\nSpiderOak will not provide information in response to a request that only references a user\u2019s name or seeks general information about a SpiderOak user.</p>\n<p>To obtain non-public information about a SpiderOak user, law enforcement requests must provide valid legal process for the type of information sought (e.g.\na subpoena, court order, or warrant).\nSpiderOak will not disclose any information unless a valid search warrant has been issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>HOW CAN I CONTACT SPIDEROAK?<p>For emergency requests relating specifically to customer

by signing in and canceling it either online or in the application itself.\nThis means your user account will no longer be active on our service, and your data will be automatically deleted in the normal course of business with no further notice to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Data Security<p>SpiderOak products are designed to have several layers of security.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We encrypt files that you upload to SpiderOak servers using the AES- 256 algorithm.\nYou control your encryption keys, and SpiderOak does not have access to them.</li>\n<li>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create a secure tunnel to protect data in transit between SpiderOak apps and servers.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t store your account passphrase on our servers in any form.\nYour passphrase is only on your device, and we hash and salt it to help protect it against possible compromise.</li>\n<li>We limit the number of SpiderOak employees who have access to user data through policy and technical access controls.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we can\u2019t absolutely guarantee that unauthorized parties won\u2019t be able to

to your original work or clear description of the materials allegedly being infringed);</li>\n<li>Identification of the infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material on our services (e.g., a URL where the allegedly infringing material is located);</li>\n<li>Your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address;</li>\n<li>Date you are sending the notice;</li>\n<li>A statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the material in the manner asserted is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can report alleged copyright infringement by emailing the above information to copyright@spideroak.com.</p>\n<p>You can also mail a copyright notice to: Laura Gowans, SpiderOak, Inc., 8216 Marshall Drive, Lenexa, KS 66214, USA.</p>\n<p>Our response to notices of alleged copyright infringement may include removing or restricting access to allegedly infringing material.\nIf we remove or restrict access to content in response to a copyright notice, we\u2019ll make a good-faith effort to get in touch with the affected account holder to provide information about the situation, including a copy of the takedown notice and instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Copyright Infringement Counter-Notice Procedure</em>.\nIf you get a message from us about a DMCA complaint, it means that the content identified in the notice has been removed from SpiderOak or access to the content has been restricted.</p>\n<p>Please read our message carefully, because it\u2019ll include information about the copyright notice we received and instructions about how to file a counter-notice.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Note</em>\n</strong>: If you re-post material removed in response to a DMCA notification, we may permanently suspend your account.\nIf you believe content was removed in error, please consider filing a counter-notice instead of re-posting the material.</p>\n<p>If you receive a DMCA notification about material you\u2019ve posted and you believe that material was misidentified or removed in error, you can file a counter-notice by following the instructions below.</p>\n<p>To submit a counter-notice, please send us the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature (typing your full name will do);</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the URL at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (the description from the DMCA notice is enough);</li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\nand</li>\n<li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which SpiderOak may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the copyright notification or an agent of such person.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To submit a counter-notice, please respond to our original email letting you know about the removal, and include the above information in the body of your reply.</p>\n<p>When we receive a valid counter-notice, we\u2019ll promptly forward a copy to the person who sent us the copyright notice.\nIf we aren\u2019t told within 10 business days that the original reporter is seeking a court order to prevent further infringement of the material, we may replace or cease disabling access to the material that was removed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Children<p>SpiderOak\u2019s Services are only for users that are either16 years old and older or have attained the age of majority in their jurisdiction.\nIf we learn an account is registered to a user that is under the age of majority , we\u2019ll terminate the minor\u2019s account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>SpiderOak Groups, Enterprise Backups,

out the problem informally, and if you are a resident of or have your principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you and SpiderOak agree to resolve any claim against each other through final and binding arbitration, including claims against SpiderOak affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents, and SpiderOak affiliates\u2019 officers, directors, employees and

rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs all disputes between you and SpiderOak.\nThe arbitrator will decide whether a dispute can be arbitrated.</p>\n<p>If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in the United States or Canada, you agree to resolve any claim you have with SpiderOak exclusively in a state or federal court with jurisdiction over Johnson County, Kansas

from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>YOUR RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION<p>You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate.\nIf you do so, neither you nor SpiderOak can require the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding.\nTo opt out, you must notify SpiderOak within 90 days of the date

consolidated, or representative action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Governing Law and Jurisdiction<p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Kansas, except for its conflict of laws principles.</p>\n<p>For claims that aren\u2019t subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Johnson County, Kansas or in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Entire Agreement<p>These Terms and our Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between you and SpiderOak.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>No Waiver<p>No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of that term.\nSpiderOak\u2019s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>Modification<p>The Terms may be modified from time to time in our sole discretion.\nThe date of the most
