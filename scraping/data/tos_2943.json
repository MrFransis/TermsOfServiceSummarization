Udemy for Business Privacy Statement Instructor Terms Affiliate Terms &amp.\nConditions Credits Program Pricing and Promotions Policy Impressum Kontakt Terms of Use\n<p>\n<i>\nThese Terms of Use (<strong>\"Terms\"</strong>) were last updated on September 16, 2020.\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>\nUdemy\u2019s mission is to improve lives through learning.\nWe enable anyone anywhere to create and share educational courses (instructors) and to enroll in these educational courses to learn (students).\nWe consider our marketplace model the best way to offer valuable educational content to our users.\nWe need rules to keep our platform and services safe for you, us and our student and instructor community.\nThese Terms apply to all your activities on the Udemy website, the Udemy mobile applications, our TV applications, our APIs and other related services (<strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>).\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you publish a course on the Udemy platform, you must also agree to the Instructor Terms.\nWe also provide details regarding our processing of personal data of our students and instructors in our Privacy Policy.\nIf you are using Udemy as part of your employer\u2019s Udemy For Business learning and development program, you can consult our Udemy for Business Privacy Statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\nIf you live in the United States or Canada, by agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve disputes with Udemy through binding arbitration (with very limited exceptions, not in court), and you waive certain rights to participate in class actions, as detailed in the Dispute Resolution section.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nTable of Contents <ul>\n<li>\n1.\nAccounts\n</li>\n<li>\n2.\nCourse Enrollment and Lifetime Access\n</li>\n<li>\n3.\nPayments, Credits, and

<p>\n</p> You need an account for most activities on our platform.\nKeep your password somewhere safe, because you\u2019re responsible for all activity associated with your account.\nIf you suspect someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team.\nYou must have reached the age of consent for online services in your country to use Udemy.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYou need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and enroll in a course or to submit a course for publication.\nWhen setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address.\nYou have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission.\nThis means you need to be careful with your password.\nYou may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else\u2019s account.\nIf you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are the owner of that account.\nIn the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may not share your account login credentials with anyone else.\nYou are responsible for what happens with your account and Udemy will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials.\nYou must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team.\nWe may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.\n</p>\n<p>\nStudents and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Udemy and use the Services.\nIf you are younger than 18 but above the required age for consent to use online services where you live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), you may not set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you enroll in courses that are appropriate for you.\nIf you are below this age of consent to use online services, you may not create a Udemy account.\nIf we discover that you have created an account that violates these rules, we will terminate your account.\nUnder our Instructor Terms, you may be requested to verify your identity before you are authorized to submit a course for publication on Udemy.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can terminate your account at any time by following the steps here.\nCheck our Privacy Policy to see what happens when you terminate your account.\n</p> 2.\nCourse Enrollment and Lifetime Access <p>\n</p> When you enroll in a course, you get a license from us to view it via the Udemy Services and no other use.\nDon\u2019t try to transfer or resell courses in any way.\nWe grant you a lifetime access license, except when we must disable the course because of legal or policy reasons.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUnder our Instructor Terms, when instructors publish a course on Udemy, they grant Udemy a license to offer a license to the course to students.\nThis means that we have the right to sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course.\nAs a student, when you enroll in a course, whether it\u2019s a free or paid course, you are getting a license from Udemy to view the course via the Udemy platform and Services, and Udemy is the licensor of record.\nCourses are licensed, and not sold, to you.\nThis license does not give you any right to resell the course in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).\n</p>\n<p>\nIn legal, more complete terms, Udemy grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with a particular courses or feature of our Services.\nAll other uses are expressly prohibited.\nYou may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any course unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a Udemy authorized representative.\nThis also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course.\nHowever, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine its content violates our Trust &amp.\nSafety Guidelines.\nThe lifetime access is not applicable to add-on features and services associated with a course.\nFor example, translation captions of courses may be disabled by instructors at any time, and instructors may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&amp;A services in association with a course.\nTo be clear, the lifetime access is to the course content but not to the instructor.\n</p>\n<p>\nInstructors may not grant licenses to their courses to students directly, and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.\n</p> 3.\nPayments, Credits, and Refunds <p>\n</p> When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method.\nIf you aren\u2019t happy with your course, Udemy offers a 30-day refund or credit for most course purchases.\n<p>\n</p> 3.1 Pricing <p>\nThe prices of courses on Udemy are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy.\nIn some instances, the price of a course offered on the Udemy website may not be exactly the same as the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due to mobile platform providers\u2019 pricing systems and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe regularly run promotions and sales for our courses and certain courses are only available at discounted prices for a set period of time.\nThe price applicable to a course will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the course (at checkout).\nAny price offered for a particular course may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren\u2019t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location when you created your account.\nIf you are not logged into your account, the price currency is based on the country where you are located.\nWe do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities.\nDepending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.\n</p> 3.2 Payments <p>\nYou agree to pay the fees for courses that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as Boleto, SEPA, direct debit, or mobile wallet) for those fees.\nUdemy works with third party payment processing partners to offer you the most convenient payment methods in your country and to keep your payment information secure.\nCheck out our Privacy Policy for more details.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method.\nIf your payment method fails and you still get access to the course you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (30) days of notification from us.\nWe reserve the right to disable access to any course for which we have not received adequate payment.\n</p> 3.3 Refunds and Refund Credits <p>\nIf the course you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 30 days of your purchase of the course, that Udemy apply a refund to your account.\nWe reserve the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our payment processing partners, the platform from which you purchased your course (website, mobile or TV app), and other factors.\nNo refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed.\nHowever, if a course you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 30-day limit.\nUdemy also reserves the right to refund students beyond the 30-day limit in cases of suspected or confirmed account fraud.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo request a refund, follow the steps here.\nAs detailed in the Instructor Terms, instructors agree that students have the right to receive these refunds.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf we decide to issue refund credits to your account, they will be automatically applied towards your next course purchase on our website, but can\u2019t be used for purchases in our mobile or TV applications.\nRefund credits may expire if not used within the specified period, and have no cash value, in each case unless otherwise required by applicable law.\n</p>\n<p>\nAt our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you\u2019ve consumed a significant portion of a course that you want to refund or if you\u2019ve previously refunded a course, we reserve the right to deny your refund, ban your account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services.\nIf we ban your account or disable your access to a course due to your violation of these Terms or our Trust &amp.\nSafety Guidelines, you will not be eligible to receive a refund.\n</p> 3.4 Gift and Promotional Codes <p>\nUdemy or our partners may offer gift and promotional codes to students.\nCertain codes may be redeemed for gift or promotional credits applied to your Udemy account, which then may be used to purchase eligible courses on our platform, subject to the terms included with your codes.\nOther codes may be directly redeemable for specific courses.\nGift and promotional credits can\u2019t be used for purchases in our mobile or TV applications.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese codes and credits, as well as any promotional value linked to them, may expire if not used within the period specified in your Udemy account.\nGift and promotional codes offered by Udemy may not be refunded for cash, unless otherwise specified in the terms included with your codes or as required by applicable law.\nGift and promotional codes offered by a partner are subject to that partner\u2019s refund policies.\nIf you have multiple saved credit amounts, Udemy may determine which of your credits to apply to your purchase.\nCheck out our Support Page and any terms included with your codes for more details.\n</p> 4.\nContent and Behavior Rules <p>\n</p> You can only use Udemy for lawful purposes.\nYou\u2019re responsible for all the content that you post on our platform.\nYou should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and other content you upload in line with our Trust &amp.\nSafety Guidelines and the law, and respect the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe can ban your account for repeated or major offenses.\nIf you think someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes.\nYour use of the Services and behavior on our platform must comply with applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country.\nYou are solely responsible for the knowledge of and compliance with such laws and regulations that are applicable to you.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may not access our Services if you are from a territory where U.S.\nbusinesses are prohibited from engaging in business (such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria) or if you have been designated a Specially Designated National, Denied Person, or Denied Entity by the U.S.\ngovernment.\nFurther, you agree not to upload any content or technology (including information on encryption) whose export is specially controlled under the Export Administration Regulations or other applicable regulations.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are a student, the Services enable you to ask questions to the instructors of courses you are enrolled in, and to post reviews of courses.\nFor certain courses, the instructor may invite you to submit content as \u201chomework\u201d or tests.\nDon\u2019t post or submit anything that is not yours.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are an instructor, you can submit courses for publication on the platform and you can also communicate with the students who have enrolled in your courses.\nIn both cases, you must abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you cannot post any course, question, answer, review or other content that violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country.\nYou are solely responsible for any courses, content, and actions you post or take via the platform and Services and their consequences.\nMake sure you understand all the copyright restrictions set forth in the Instructor Terms before you submit any course for publication on Udemy.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf we are put on notice that your course or content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behavior violates our Trust &amp.\nSafety Guidelines, or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from our platform.\nUdemy complies with copyright laws.\nCheck out our Intellectual Property Policy for more details.\n</p>\n<p>\nUdemy has discretion in enforcing these Terms and our Trust &amp.\nSafety Guidelines.\nWe may terminate or suspend your permission to use our platform and Services or ban your account at any time, with or without notice, for any or no reason, including for any violation of these Terms, if you fail to pay any fees when due, upon the request of law enforcement or government agencies, for extended periods of inactivity, for unexpected technical issues or problems, or if we suspect that you engage in fraudulent or illegal activities, or for any other reason in our sole discretion.\nUpon any such termination we may delete your account and content, and we may prevent you from further access to the platforms and use of our Services.\nYour content may still be available on the platforms even if your account is terminated or suspended.\nYou agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of your account, removal of your content, or blocking of your access to our platforms and services.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf one of our instructors has published a course that infringes your copyright or trademark rights, please let us know.\nOur Instructor Terms require our instructors to follow the law and respect the intellectual property rights of others.\nFor more details on how to file a copyright or trademark infringement claim with us, see our Intellectual Property Policy.\n</p> 5.\nUdemy\u2019s Rights to Content You Post <p>\n</p> You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your courses.\nWe\u2019re allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising on other websites.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nThe content you post as a student or instructor (including courses) remains yours.\nBy posting courses and other content, you allow Udemy to reuse and share it but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content.\nIf you are an instructor, be sure to understand the course licensing terms that are detailed in the Instructor Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize Udemy to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed).\nThis includes making your content available to other companies, organizations, or individuals who partner with Udemy for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication of content on other media, as well as using your content for marketing purposes.\nYou also waive any rights of privacy, publicity, or other rights of a similar nature applicable to all these uses, to the extent permissible under applicable law.\nYou represent and warrant that you have all the rights, power, and authority necessary to authorize us to use any content that you submit.\nYou also agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.\n</p> 6.\nUsing Udemy at Your Own Risk <p>\n</p> Anyone can use Udemy to create and publish courses and instructors and we enable instructors and students to interact for teaching and learning.\nLike other platforms where people can post content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use Udemy at your own risk.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nOur platform model means we do not review or edit the courses for legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality of course content.\nWe do not exercise any editorial control over the courses that are available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the courses.\nIf you enroll in a course, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable.\nUdemy has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or enrollment in any course, to the extent permissible under applicable law.\nThis also applies to any courses relating to health, wellness, and physical exercise.\nYou acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of courses, and by enrolling in such courses you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death.\nYou assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during, and after your enrollment in a course.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal information that you share.\nWhile we restrict the types of information instructors may request from students, we do not control what students and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform.\nYou should not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe do not hire or employ instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between instructors and students.\nWe are not liable for disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don\u2019t own or control.\nWe are not responsible for the content or any other aspect of these third-party sites, including their collection of information about you.\nYou should also read their terms and conditions and privacy policies.\n</p> 7.\nUdemy\u2019s Rights <p>\n</p> We own the Udemy platform and Services, including the website, present or future apps and services, and things like our logos, API, code, and content created by our employees.\nYou can\u2019t tamper with those or use them without authorization.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nAll right, title, and interest in and to the Udemy platform and Services, including our website, our existing or future applications, our APIs, databases, and the content our employees or partners submit or provide through our Services (but excluding content provided by instructors and students) are and will remain the exclusive property of Udemy and its licensors.\nOur platforms and services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both the United States and foreign countries.\nNothing gives you a right to use the Udemy name or any of the Udemy trademarks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.\nAny feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding Udemy or the Services is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments, or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Udemy platform and Services:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\naccess, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the platform (including content storage), Udemy\u2019s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Udemy\u2019s service providers.\n</li>\n<li>\ndisable, interfere with, or try to circumvent any of the features of the platforms related to security or probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any of our systems.\n</li>\n<li>\ncopy, modify, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any source code of or content on the Udemy platform or Services.\n</li>\n<li>\naccess or search or attempt to access or search our platform by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available search functionalities that are provided via our website, mobile apps, or API (and only pursuant to those API terms and conditions).\nYou may not scrape, spider, use a robot, or use other automated means of any kind to access the Services.\n</li>\n<li>\nin any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information (such as sending email communications falsely appearing as Udemy).\nor interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host, or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing the platforms or services, or in any other manner interfering with or creating an undue burden on the Services.\n</li>\n</ul> 8.\nMiscellaneous Legal Terms <p>\n</p> These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms that protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal relationship between us and you.\n<p>\n</p> 8.1 Binding Agreement <p>\nYou agree that by registering, accessing, or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with Udemy.\nIf you do not agree to these Terms, do not register, access, or otherwise use any of our Services.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\nAny version of these Terms in a language other than English is provided for convenience and you understand and agree that the English language will control if there is any conflict.\n</p>\n<p>\nThese Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute the entire agreement between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor, the Instructor Terms and the Promotions Policy).\n</p>\n<p>\nIf any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue in effect.\n</p>\n<p>\nEven if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in one case, it doesn\u2019t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them in the future.\nIf we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn\u2019t mean we waive our rights generally or in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe following sections shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: Sections 2 (Course Enrollment and Lifetime Access), 5 (Udemy\u2019s Rights to Content You Post), 6 (Using Udemy at Your Own Risk), 7 (Udemy\u2019s Rights), 8 (Miscellaneous Legal Terms), and 9 (Dispute Resolution).\n</p> 8.2 Disclaimers <p>\nIt may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or because something goes down with the site.\nIt may happen that one of our instructors is making misleading statements in their course.\nIt may also happen that we encounter security issues.\nThese are just examples.\nYou accept that you will not have any recourse against us in any of these types of cases where things don\u2019t work out right.\nIn legal, more complete language, <strong>the Services and their content are provided on an \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available\u201d basis.\nWe (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or warranties about the

conflicts of law principles, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts in Delhi, India.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you\u2019re a student located in a geographical region other than

to its choice or conflicts of law principles.\nIn cases where the \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section below doesn\u2019t apply to you, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of federal and state courts in San Francisco, California, USA.\n</p> 8.6 Legal Actions and Notices <p>\nNo action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by either party

entity.\nYou agree that your account is non-transferable and that all rights to your account and other rights under these Terms terminate upon your death.\n</p> 9.\nDispute Resolution <p>\n</p> If there\u2019s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue.\nIf that doesn\u2019t work and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding arbitration.\nyou may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>This Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the United States or Canada.</strong> Most disputes can be resolved, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Support Team.\n</p> 9.1 Small Claims <p>\nEither of us can bring a claim in small claims court in (a) San Francisco, California, (b) the county where you live, or (c) another place we both agree on, as long as it qualifies to be brought in that court.\n</p> 9.2 Going to Arbitration <p>\nIf we can\u2019t resolve our dispute amicably, you and Udemy agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory.\nIf one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration).\nEither of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.\n</p> 9.3 The Arbitration Process <p>\nAny disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.\nA party electing arbitration must initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA).\nThe arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes.\nYou and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief).\n(b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise).\nand (c) any judgment on the arbitrator\u2019s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction.\nDisputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD must be resolved per the AAA\u2019s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.\n</p> 9.4 No Class Actions <p>\nWe both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis.\nThis means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.\n(b) an arbitrator can\u2019t combine multiple people\u2019s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action).\nand (c) an arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can\u2019t be used to decide other users\u2019 disputes.\nIf a court decides that this \u201cNo class actions\u201d clause isn\u2019t enforceable or valid, then this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.\n</p> 9.5 Changes <p>\nNotwithstanding the \u201cUpdating these Terms\u201d section below, if Udemy changes this \"Dispute Resolution\" section after the date you last indicated acceptance to

email address specified in your account or by posting a notice through our Services.\nModifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\nYour continued

certain data about you with instructors, other students, companies performing services for us, Udemy affiliates, our business partners, analytics and data enrichment providers, your social media providers, companies helping us run promotions and surveys, and advertising companies who help us promote our Services.\nWe may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring.\nLastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>With Your Instructors:</u>\nWe share data that we have about you (except your email address) with instructors or teaching assistants for courses you enroll in or request information about, so they can improve their courses for you and other students.\nThis data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to Udemy, and your activities on Udemy.\nIf we collect additional data about you (like age or gender), we may share that too.\nWe will not share your email address with instructors or teaching assistants.\nWe also enable our instructors to implement Google Analytics on their course pages to track sources of traffic to their courses and optimize their course pages.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>With Other Students and Instructors:</u>\nDepending on your settings, your shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors.\nIf you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also be publicly viewable by other users depending on your settings.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:</u>\nWe share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, fraud and abuse prevention, data analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and hosting services, and customer services and support.\nThese service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>With Udemy Affiliates:</u>\nWe may share your data within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control to enable or support us in providing the Services.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>With Business Partners:</u>\nWe have agreements with other websites and platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to Udemy.\nFor example, we work with Benesse in Japan.\nDepending on your location, we may share your data with these partners.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>With Analytics and Data Enrichment Services:</u>\nAs part of our use of third-party analytics tools like Google Analytics and data enrichment services like ZoomInfo, we share certain contact information, Account Data, System Data, Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1), or de-identified data as needed.\nDe-identified data means data where we\u2019ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID.\nThis allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources).\nWe do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>To Power Social Media Features:</u>\nThe social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you\u2019re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company\u2019s privacy policy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>To Administer Promotions and Surveys:</u>\nWe may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>For Advertising:</u>\nIf we decide to use an advertising-supported revenue model in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users.\nWe may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics.\nAdvertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you.\nTo learn more or opt out from participating ad networks\u2019 behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below.\nNote that if you opt out, you\u2019ll continue to be served generic ads.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>For Security and Legal Compliance:</u>\nWe may disclose your data to third parties if we (in our sole discretion) have a good faith belief that the disclosure is:\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nPermitted or required by law.\n</li>\n<li>\nRequested as part of a judicial, governmental, or legal inquiry, order, or proceeding.\n</li>\n<li>\nReasonably necessary as part of a valid subpoena, warrant, or other legally-valid request.\n</li>\n<li>\nReasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other legal agreements.\n</li>\n<li>\nRequired to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, misuse, potential violations of law (or rule or regulation), or security or technical issues.\nor\n</li>\n<li>\nReasonably necessary in our discretion to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of Udemy, our users, employees, members of the public, or our Services.\n</li>\n<li>\nWe may also disclose data about you to our auditors and legal advisors in order to assess our disclosure obligations and rights under this Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<li>\n<u>During a Change in Control:</u>\nIf Udemy undergoes a business transaction like a merger, acquisition, corporate divestiture, or dissolution (including bankruptcy), or a sale of all or some of its assets, we may share, disclose, or transfer all of your data to the successor organization during such transition or in contemplation of a transition (including during due diligence).\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>After Aggregation/De-identification:</u>\nwe may disclose or use aggregated or de-identified data for any purpose.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>With Your Permission:</u>\nwith your consent, we may share data to third parties outside the scope of this Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> 5.\nSecurity <p>\n</p> We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored.\nAs with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it\u2019s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\nUdemy takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store.\nThese measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data.\nUnfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and Udemy, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.\nYour password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it.\nYou should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact our Support Team with any concerns.\n</p> 6.\nYour Rights <p>\n</p> You have certain rights around the use of your data, including the ability to opt out of promotional emails, cookies, and collection of your data by certain third parties.\nYou can update or terminate your account

child should contact us for help deleting that information.\n<p>\n</p> 6.1 Your Choices About the Use of Your Data <p>\nYou can choose not to provide certain data to us, but you may not be able to use

receive or by changing the email preferences in your account.\nNote that regardless of your email preference settings, we will send you transactional and relationship messages regarding the Services, including administrative confirmations, order confirmations, important updates about the Services, and notices about our policies.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf you\u2019re located in the European Economic Area, you may opt out of certain Data Collection Tools by clicking the \u201cCookie settings\u201c link at the bottom of any page.\n</li>\n<li>\nThe browser or device you use may allow you to control cookies and other types of local data storage.\nTo learn more about managing cookies, visit https://cookiepedia.co.uk/how-to-manage-cookies.\nYour wireless device may also allow you to control whether location or other data is collected and shared.\n</li>\n<li>\nTo get information and control cookies used for tailored advertising from participating companies, see the consumer opt-out pages for the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance, or if you\u2019re located in the European Economic Area, visit the Your Online Choices site.\nTo opt out of Google\u2019s display
