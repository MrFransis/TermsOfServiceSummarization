These actions and information are private and we don't share or distribute them to others on the website.\n</p>\n<p>Of course, maintaining your trust is our top concern, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>\n<p>We do not rent, sell, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as described in this policy or as required by law</p>\n<p>We do not share any information you have not chosen to display on your Alignable profile to other parties, unless compelled by law, or as necessary to enforce our User Agreement or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Alignable, its Users, and the public</p>\n<p>All information that you provide will be protected with industry standard protocols and technology.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.\nIf we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by means of a notice on our home page so that you may access and review the changes to this document in advance of your continued use of the service.\nIf you object to any changes, you may close your account.\nBy continuing to use the Alignable service after notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the Alignable website, you are consenting to the changes.</p>\n<p>\nPlease read this policy and send us questions, concerns and suggestions by\ncontacting support.\n</p>\n<p>What Alignable\u2019s Privacy Policy Covers:</p>\n<p>1.\nInformation collected by Alignable.</p>\n<p>2.\nHow Alignable uses your information.</p>\n<p>3.\nYour information choices.</p>\n<p>4.\nYour obligations as a User.</p>\n<p>5.\nImportant information regarding service eligibility and US Department of Commerce Safe Harbor certification.</p>\n<p>6.\nSecurity.</p>\n<p>7.\nHow to contact us.</p>\n<p>1.\nInformation Collected</p>\n<p>The mission of Alignable is to connect the world\u2019s local businesses and organizations to enable them to be more productive and successful.\nTo achieve our Mission, we make services available through our website, mobile applications, and developer platform, premium services, and other information provided as part of the Alignable services (\u201cServices\u201d) to enable you, your connections, and your community to meet, exchange ideas, learn, make deals, or find opportunities, create, share, and distribute information in collaboration with one another, and make decisions in a network of trusted relationships and groups.</p>\n<p>By joining Alignable, you voluntarily and willingly provide Alignable Corporation in Boston MA, USA certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services.\nIf you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the Alignable website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a member of the Alignable community.\nand, if you are already a member, you should close your account.</p>\n<p>We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>\n<p>1.\nRegistration: In order to become a User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, business, address, country, and password.\nWithout this minimal amount of information, you cannot create an Alignable account.\nLike other passwords, you should choose one that is known only by you.\nAlignable requests other information from you during the registration process, (e.g., industry, location, etc.) that Alignable uses to provide better, more customized services such as language-specific profile pages and updates, better ads, and more valuable marketing opportunities.\nYou acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on Alignable.\nyou allow others, including Alignable, to identify you and to allow Alignable to use your information in accordance with our User Agreement.</p>\n<p>2.\nProfile Information: Once you become a User, you may provide additional information to your Alignable Profile describing your interests, business history, background, recommendations from other Alignable Users, group memberships, and networking objectives (among other options).\nProviding additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you, but providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from Alignable and your business network by helping you build your local business identity and leverage your network and facilitating your search for marketing partners, resources, information, and new opportunities.\nAny information you provide at registration or in the Profile section may be used by Alignable as described in the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of allowing marketing opportunities to find you on Alignable, or for serving more relevant advertisements on Alignable.\nLearn more about Alignable\u2019s advertising practices by reading this privacy policy, in particular Sections 1.H, 2.J, and 2.K.\nIf you decide not to share certain information, you may not receive the full benefit of being an Alignable User.</p>\n<p>3.\nContacts Information: In order to connect with others on Alignable, you may use the Services to send invitations either to their Alignable profiles or email addresses of people you know if they have not registered with Alignable.\nThe names and email addresses of people whom you invite will be used to send your invitations and reminders as well as to allow Alignable to help expand your network.\nPlease note that when you send an invitation to connect to another User or to an unregistered person inviting them to join Alignable and connect with you, Alignable automatically sends up to 2 reminders to the recipient of your invitation if your invitation is not accepted and that the recipient of an invitation will have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation.\nYour Alignable connections will also have access to your email address.\nYou may not invite anyone you do not know and trust to connect with you.\nYou may also choose to manually enter or upload data about your contacts to the \u201cContacts\u201d section of your account on Alignable.\nInformation entered into Contacts is only viewable by you.\nBy providing email addresses or other information of non-Users to Alignable, you represent that you have authority to do so.\nAll information that you enter or upload about your contacts is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy and will enable us to provide customized services such as suggesting people to connect with on Alignable.</p>\n<p>4.\nCustomer Service: We collect information when you interact with Alignable\u2019s website in order to accurately categorize and respond to customer inquiries and investigate breaches of our terms.</p>\n<p>5.\nUsing the Alignable Site and Applications: We receive information when you interact with and use the Alignable website, Alignable Applications (e.g.\nAlignable for iPhone, Android, etc.), and Alignable platform technology (such as \u201cShare on Alignable\u201d plugins for publishers).\nFor example, we know when you click on ads, upload content, join groups, participate in polls, install aAlignable mobile application, share content on Alignable, etc.</p>\n<p>\n6.\nUsing Third Party Services and Visiting Third Party Sites: We receive information when you use your Alignable account to log in or authenticate to a third-party website or application.\nAlso, if you are logged into Alignable and visit a third party site that embeds Alignable professional plugins, like \u201cShare on Alignable\u201d for web publishers, Alignable will receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser.\nAlignable will use this information to personalize the Alignable-provided functionality, including providing you insights from your Alignable network, allowing you to share information with your network, enabling you to use Alignable functionality off the Alignable site and serving you more relevant advertising.\nUsers wishing to disable this personalization may\nopt-out\nof this feature.\nAlignable\u2019s retention of this data is addressed in Section 1.K.\n</p>\n<p>7.\nCookies: Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, to customize your experience on Alignable, as well as to deliver Alignable and third-party advertising to Users both on and off the Alignable site.\nA cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the Alignable website using the same computer and web browser.\nYou can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases doing so may impact your ability to use Alignable.\nOne type of cookie, known as a \u201cpersistent\u201d cookie, is set once you\u2019ve logged in to your Alignable account.\nThe next time you visit the Alignable website, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Services.\nIn order to access or change any of your private information (like a credit card number) or to send a message to another User, however, you must log in securely again with your password even if your computer contains your persistent cookie.\nAnother type of cookie, called a \u201csession\u201d cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Alignable website.\nSession cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.\nOther technology like Macromedia\u2019s flash can be used to place the functional equivalent of a cookie on your computer.\nYou can control flash \u201clocal stored objects\u201d or \u201cflash cookies\u201d using the Macromedia Website Privacy Settings Panel at www.macromedia.com.\nAlignable may use cookie-equivalent technology for the limited purpose of enhancing the security of Alignable's services.\nWe do not use flash cookies for advertising purposes.\nIn the course of serving advertisements or optimizing the Services to our Users, we may allow authorized third parties to place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.\nAny information provided to third parties through cookies will not be personally identifiable but may provide general segment information (e.g., your industry or geography, career field, or information about your professional or educational background) for the enhancement of your user experience by providing more relevant advertising.\nMost browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nAlignable does not store unencrypted personally identifiable information in the cookies.</p>\n<p>\n8.\nAdvertising and Web Beacons: To support the Services we provide at no cost to our Users, as well as provide a more relevant and useful experience for our Users, we target and serve our own ads and third-party ads both on and off the site using ad networks.\nAd networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad exchanges, ad technology vendors and research firms.\nWe target ads to Users based on general profile categories (e.g., \u201cproduct managers in Texas\u201d) or on non-personally identifiable information inferred from a User\u2019s profile (e.g., industry, current or former business, years in business, nationality, or other aspects of your life) in addition to a User\u2019s use of Alignable or their clicking on Alignable ad inventory.\nAlignable does not provide personally identifiable information to any third party ad network.\nWe use ad technology such as web beacons, pixels, anonymous ad network tags, and cookies to more effectively serve ads to our Users on and off Alignable through ad networks, as well as to collect anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers.\nBecause your web browser requests advertisements and web beacons directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.\nYou may opt-out of ads served to you off Alignable\nhere,\nby turning off \u201cAdvertising Preferences.\u201d If you opt-out you may lose certain functionality of the Alignable Services, as well as the potential benefit of receiving ads that are targeted to your interests which, in turn, may limit your ability to fully realize the benefits of the Alignable Services to build and leverage your professional network.\n</p>\n<p>9.\nLog files, IP Addresses and information about your computer and mobile device: Due to the communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Alignable website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Alignable.\nAdditionally, advertisers receive the URL of the page you were on when you click on an ad on Alignable.\nAlignable also receives the internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device (including your UDID) and mobile operating system (if you are accessing Alignable using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier.\nAlignable may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have enabled.\nAlso, as described above in Sections 1.E.\nand 1.F., Alignable receives information when you access web pages containing Alignable interactive plugins, such as \u201cShare on Alignable\u201d or \u201cConnect with Alignable\u201d functionality.\nYou can control the collection and use of this information here.\nThe link between your IP address and your personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties without your permission, except as described in Section 2.L (\u201cCompliance with Legal Process\u201d), below.</p>\n<p>\n10.\nRights to Access, Correct and Eliminate Information About You: You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data you supplied to Alignable.\nIf you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information that you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this policy.\nYou may request deletion of your information at any time by\ncontacting Alignable customer service.\nWe will respond to your request within 30 days.\nPlease note, however that information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible even if you request its deletion.\n</p>\n<p>\n11.\nData Retention: Alignable will retain your information for so long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, except in the case of our professional plugin impression data, which we de-identify after 12 months.\nIf you wish to close your account, you may do so\nhere.\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>2.\nUses of personal information</p>\n<p>\n1.\nConsent to Alignable Processing Information About You: The information you provide to Alignable may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, gender, age, and other aspects of your life.\nBy providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your Alignable profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and Alignable\u2019s User Agreement that allow Alignable to process information about you.\nSupplying information to Alignable, including any information deemed \u201csensitive\u201d by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part.\nYou have the right to withdraw your consent to Alignable\u2019s collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, by changing your Settings, or by\nclosing your account,\nbut please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.\n</p>\n<p>\n2.\nAlignable Communications: As described in the User Agreement, we will communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Alignable website, messages to your Alignable inbox, or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages.\nWe may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the Services, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services.\nWe may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information.\nYou can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing your settingsrelated to your email notification choices.\nIf you wish, you can also opt-out of receiving promotional emails by sending a\nrequest to Alignable customer service.\nPlease be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving service messages from Alignable.\nAlso, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges).\n</p>\n<p>3.\nUser Communications: Many communications you initiate through Alignable (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your primary email address and name in the header of the message.\nMessages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you\u2019re directly connected.\nOther communications that you initiate through the Alignable website, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information.\nYour contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.</p>\n<p>4.\nCustomized Content: We use information you provide to us (or to third parties with whom Alignable offers combined services) to customize your experience on our website.\nFor example, when you login to your account, we will display the names of new Users who have recently joined your network or recent status updates from your connections.</p>\n<p>5.\nSharing Information with Third Parties: Alignable takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy.\nWe will also not share other personal information not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Alignable services (Groups, Joins, Company Pages, etc.) without your explicit consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless, disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures.\n(2) enforce this Agreement.\n(3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency.\n(4) respond to customer service inquiries.\nor (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Alignable, our Users or the public.\nAlignable offers a \u201cpublic profile\u201d feature that allows Users to publish portions of their Alignable profile to the public internet.\nThis public profile will be crawled by and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name.\nYou may opt-out of this feature by editing your account settings.\nhowever, Alignable does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.\nContent distributed through Alignable\u2019s sharing features and third party integrations may result in displaying some of your information outside of Alignable.\nFor example, when you post content to aAlignable Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results.\nOr, if you have bound your Alignable account to your Twitter account, you can easily share content into both Alignable as well as to Twitter.\nWe may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on Alignable.</p>\n<p>\n6.\nDevelopers using Alignable Platform Services: We collaborate with and allow third parties to use Alignable\u2019s developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with and outside of Alignable.\nThese third parties are either partners (\u201cAlignable Partners\u201d) with whom we have negotiated an agreement to provide services (\u201cCombined Services\u201d), for example, InApps, or developers (\u201cPlatform Developers\u201d) who have agreed to our developer terms in order to build applications (\u201cPlatform Applications\u201d).\nBoth the negotiated agreements and our API terms and conditions contain restrictions on access, storage and use of your information.\nIf you choose to use Combined Services or a Platform Application, you may be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and/or user agreement of the Alignable Partner or Platform Developer, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by Alignable.\nIt is your choice whether or not to make use of Combined Services or Platform Applications and whether to proceed under any third party terms, and once you do, the third party's terms, and not this policy, will govern how they handle information you provide to them directly or through your Alignable account.\nAlso, despite our agreements and technical steps taken to restrict access to and avoid possible misuse of information, we may not screen or audit all Combined Services or Platform Applications.\nWe also cannot guarantee that any Alignable Partner or Platform Developer will abide by our agreement.\nYou agree that your use of Combined Services or Platform Applications is on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without any warranty.\nIf you use any Combined Service or Platform Application, the Alignable Partner or Platform Developer may access and share certain information about you, such as non-public profile information and information visible only to your connections.\nThis includes information about your connections by virtue of you being connected to others.\nHowever, unless you have used a Combined Service or Platform Application, it can only access the information about you that is otherwise visible to other Alignable Users.\nTo revoke permission granted to a Combined Service or Platform Application at any time, please visit the settings page.\nIf the relevant Platform Developer or Application, or Alignable Partner is not listed under Authorized Applications, go directly to the Application Details page for the Platform Application you wish to uninstall.\nNote, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted a third party, your connections, other members of your network, or other Users of Alignable may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application or Combined Service may still have access to certain information about you, just as those Users do.\nYou may opt-out of providing information to third parties through others connected to you by\ncontacting support.\nTo report any suspected misuse of information, contact Alignable\u2019s customer service.\nAlignable is not responsible for your use of or inability to use any Combined Service or Platform Application, including the content, accuracy, or reliability of applications and the privacy practices or other policies of Alignable Partners or Platform Developers.\n</p>\n<p>7.\nPolls and Surveys: Polls and Surveys may be conducted by Alignable, Alignable Users or third parties.\nAs a User, you may be invited to participate in polls and surveys from the Alignable website.\nYour selection may be random, or it may be based on your non-personally identifiable information, such as job title, geography, company size and/or industry.\nWhether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you.\nAfter you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page.\nSome third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll.\nFurther, Alignable or third parties may follow up with you via Alignable Messaging regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving messages.\nWe may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls.\nIf the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will only be used for the purpose of delivering incentives and/or verifying your contact information.\nIt is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive.\nWe will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third parties in connection with the conduct of any polls or surveys.\nYour consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.</p>\n<p>8.\nSearch: We offer search services to help find information and learn more about other Users (for example, you can search for Users with particular interests or marketing experience, or that you may know from your community or profession), as well as marketing opportunities.\nAlignable search also allows Users to find marketing opportunities, companies, and contributions to the community aspects of the Alignable Services, such as Groups and Answers that will help Users more effectively use Alignable and expand their network.\nWe use information from User profiles and contributions to Groups, Company Pages, and Answers to inform and refine our search service.</p>\n<p>9.\nAnswers, Groups, and other Services: If you post on the Answers section of Alignable, participate in Alignable Groups, or import a blog, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be read, collected, or used by other Users of these forums, as well as Platform Developers and other third parties, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.\nAlignable is not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums.\nAlso, some content in Alignable Groups may be public and searchable on the internet if the Group owner has opened the group for public discussions.\nYou can delete your posts to Answers and Alignable Groups at any time.\nHowever, please note that ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Users, and Alignable cannot guarantee that other Users have not made copies of or use the ideas and information that you share with others on Alignable.</p>\n<p>10.\nTestimonials and Advertisements Placed through Alignable Ads Service: If you provide any testimonials about the Alignable Services or place advertisements through the Alignable Ads, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties.\nTestimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided.</p>\n<p>\n11.\nAdvertising and Endorsements on Alignable: In order to deliver relevant and valuable ads to you and your network, Alignable may use your name and profile photo in connection with social advertising based on content shared on Alignable.\nThis advertising may include the fact that you have recommended or endorsed a product or service on Alignable, connected with a company, joined Groups or conversations, established or added content to your profile, etc., and will only be displayed to your Alignable network.\nYou can opt-out of allowing your name and/or profile photo to be used in social ads\nhere.\n</p>\n<p>12.\nCompliance with Legal Process: It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information and/or information about your activities as an Alignable User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if Alignable has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies.\n(b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site.\nand/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Alignable, our Users, employees, or others.</p>\n<p>13.\nDisclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of Alignable Corporation: We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a sale of the assets of Alignable Corporation, a subsidiary or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company.\nAny third party to which Alignable transfers or sells Alignable\u2019s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.</p>\n<p>3.\nYour Information Choices</p>\n<p>\n1.\nAccessing and Changing Your Account Information: You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your Alignable account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to\nyour account\non the Alignable website.\nPlease be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, Alignable may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.\n</p>\n<p>\n2.\nDefault Settings: Because the mission of Alignable is to connect the world\u2019s local businesses to enable them to become more productive and successful, we have established what we believe to be reasonable default settings that we have found most professionals desire.\nBecause Users may use and interact with Alignable in a variety of ways, and because those uses may change over time, we designed our settings to provide our users granular control over the information they share.\nWe encourage our Users to review their account settings and adjust them in accordance with their preferences.\nAlignable accounts are also defaulted to allow Users to be contacted to participate in polls, surveys and partner advertising.\nContact support to change these settings.\n</p>\n<p>3.\nClosing Your Account: You can close your account through the Alignable customer service site.\nIf you close your Alignable account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database.\nIf you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability.\nHowever, we may retain certain data contributed by you if Alignable believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law.\nAlignable may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users.\nFor example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person\u2019s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails or Alignable Messages you send on Alignable to other Users, as well as your contributions to Alignable Answers or Groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account.\nSimilarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible.\nAlignable disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the
