others about your brand affiliation.\nCopyright Images uploaded to CounterSocial servers may be automatically water-marked with the server address, however all rights including the legal copyright of any user uploaded image and or content remain solely and wholly with the owner of the image and or content.\nWe will respond to clear and complete notices of alleged copyright infringement.\nGraphic

fraudulently abuse the verification badge for the purposes of impersonating other users or company brands by name.\nPRO users may request for their own verified user status to be removed if they so wish.\nmisuse of countersocial badges You may not use CounterSocial badges, unless provided by CounterSocial.\nAccounts using unauthorized badges as part of their profile photos, header photos,

are inactive for more than six months.\nabusive behavior We believe in freedom of expression and open dialogue, but that means little as an underlying philosophy if voices are silenced because people are afraid to speak up.\nIn order to ensure that people feel safe expressing diverse opinions and beliefs, we prohibit behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another user\u2019s voice.\nContext matters when evaluating for abusive behavior and determining appropriate enforcement actions.\nFactors we may take into

health partners.\nchild sexual exploitation You may not promote child sexual exploitation of ANY kind.\nCounterSocial is committed to providing no safe haven for abusers and exploiters of

Media Exploitation Center (NMEC) databases of known Child Sex Abuse Material (CSAM) hashes.\nThis happens at our infrastructure edge - BEFORE any image lands on CounterSocials' at-rest encrypted storage systems.\nIf a positive hash-match is discovered CounterSocial administrators will be alerted, in realtime, and neccessary actions will be taken to lock the offending account, preserve evidence, and notify the appropriate law enforcement agencies.\nNo ifs.\nNo buts.\nNo exceptions, no mercy.\nPRIVACY NOTE to users: At NO TIME are your images being 'viewed' or 'looked' at.\nThey are simply being 'hashed' and that hash then compared to NMEC CSAM hash databases.\nabuse and hateful conduct You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone, or incite other people to do so.\nWe
