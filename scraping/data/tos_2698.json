<strong>&nbsp;</strong> (2) <strong>Qualtrics</strong>.\n&nbsp.\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>BACKGROUND</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Purpose and Application.</strong> This document is incorporated into the Agreement and forms part of a written (including in electronic form) contract between Qualtrics and Customer.\nThis DPA applies to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics and its Subprocessors in connection with its provision of the Cloud Service.\nThis DPA does not apply to non-production environments of the Cloud Service if such environments are made available by Qualtrics, and Customer shall not store Personal Data in such environments.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Structure.</strong> Appendices 1 and 2 are incorporated into and form part of this DPA.\nThey set out the agreed subject-matter, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of Personal Data, categories of data subjects and the applicable technical and organizational measures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>GDPR.</strong> Qualtrics and Customer agree that it is each party\u2019s responsibility to review and adopt requirements imposed on Controllers and Processors by the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (<strong>\u201cGDPR\u201d</strong>), in particular with regards to Articles 28 and 32 to 36 of the GDPR, if and to the extent applicable to Personal Data of Customer/Controllers that is processed under the DPA.\nFor illustration purposes, Appendix 3 lists the relevant GDPR requirements and the corresponding sections in this DPA.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Governance.</strong> Qualtrics acts as a Processor and Customer and those entities that it permits to use the Cloud Service act as Controllers under the DPA.\nCustomer acts as a single point of contact and is solely responsible for obtaining any relevant authorizations, consents and permissions for the processing of Personal Data in accordance with this DPA, including, where applicable approval by Controllers to use Qualtrics as a Processor.\nWhere authorizations, consent, instructions or permissions are provided by Customer these are provided not only on behalf of the Customer but also on behalf of any other Controller using the Cloud Service.\nWhere Qualtrics informs or gives notice to Customer, such information or notice is deemed received by those Controllers permitted by Customer to use the Cloud Service and it is Customer\u2019s responsibility to forward such information and notices to the relevant Controllers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SECURITY OF PROCESSING</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Appropriate Technical and Organizational Measures.</strong> Qualtrics has implemented and will apply the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2.\nCustomer has reviewed such measures and agrees that as to the Cloud Service selected by Customer in the Order Form the measures are appropriate taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of Personal Data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Changes.</strong> Qualtrics applies the technical and organizational measures set forth in Appendix 2 to Qualtrics\u2019 entire customer base hosted out of the same Data Center and receiving the same Cloud Service.\nQualtrics may change the measures set out in Appendix 2 at any time without notice so long as it maintains a comparable or better level of security.\nIndividual measures may be replaced by new measures that serve the same purpose without diminishing the security level protecting Personal Data.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>QUALTRICS OBLIGATIONS</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Instructions from Customer.</strong> Qualtrics will process Personal Data only in accordance with documented instructions from Customer.\nThe Agreement (including this DPA) constitutes such documented initial instructions and each use of the Cloud Service then constitutes further instructions.\nQualtrics will use reasonable efforts to follow any other Customer instructions, as long as they are required by Data Protection Law, technically feasible and do not require changes to the Cloud Service.\nIf any of the before-mentioned exceptions apply, or Qualtrics otherwise cannot comply with an instruction or is of the opinion that an instruction infringes Data Protection Law, Qualtrics will immediately notify Customer (email permitted).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Processing on Legal Requirement.</strong> Qualtrics may also process Personal Data where required to do so by applicable law.\nIn such a case, Qualtrics shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personnel.</strong> To process Personal Data, Qualtrics and its Subprocessors shall only grant access to authorized personnel who have committed themselves to confidentiality.\nQualtrics and its Subprocessors will regularly train personnel having access to Personal Data in applicable data security and data privacy measures.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cooperation.</strong> At Customer\u2019s request, Qualtrics will reasonably cooperate with Customer and Controllers in dealing with requests from Data Subjects or regulatory authorities regarding Qualtrics\u2019 processing of Personal Data or any Personal Data Breach.\nQualtrics shall notify the Customer as soon as reasonably practical about any request it has received from a Data Subject in relation to the Personal Data processing, without itself responding to such request without Customer\u2019s further instructions, if applicable.\nQualtrics shall provide functionality that supports Customer\u2019s ability to correct or remove Personal Data from the Cloud Service, or restrict its processing in line with Data Protection Law.\nWhere such functionality is not provided, Qualtrics will correct or remove any Personal Data, or restrict its processing, in accordance with the Customer\u2019s instruction and Data Protection Law.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Data Breach Notification.</strong> Qualtrics will notify Customer without undue delay after becoming aware of any Personal Data Breach and provide reasonable information in its possession to assist Customer to meet Customer\u2019s obligations to report a Personal Data Breach as required under Data Protection Law.\nQualtrics may provide such information in phases as it becomes available.\nSuch notification shall not be interpreted or construed as an admission of fault or liability by Qualtrics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Protection Impact Assessment.</strong> If, pursuant to Data Protection Law, Customer (or its Controllers) are required to perform a data protection impact assessment or prior consultation with a regulator, at Customer\u2019s request, Qualtrics will provide such documents as are generally available for the Cloud Service (for example, this DPA, the Agreement, audit reports or certifications).\nAny additional assistance shall be mutually agreed between the Parties.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>DATA EXPORT AND DELETION</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Export and Retrieval by Customer.</strong> During the Subscription Term and subject to the Agreement, Customer can access its Personal Data at any time.\nCustomer may export and retrieve its Personal Data in a standard format.\nExport and retrieval may be subject to technical limitations, in which case Qualtrics and Customer will find a reasonable method to allow Customer access to Personal Data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deletion.</strong> Before the Subscription Term expires, Customer may use Qualtrics\u2019 self-service export tools (as available) to perform a final export of Personal Data from the Cloud Service (which shall constitute a \u201creturn\u201d of Personal Data).\nAt the end of the Subscription Term, Customer hereby instructs Qualtrics to delete the Personal Data remaining on servers hosting the Cloud Service within a reasonable time period in line with Data Protection Law (not to exceed six months) unless applicable law requires retention.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>CERTIFICATIONS AND AUDITS</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer Audit.</strong> Customer or its independent third party auditor reasonably acceptable to Qualtrics (which shall not include any third party auditors who are either a competitor of Qualtrics or not suitably qualified or independent) may audit Qualtrics\u2019 control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics only if:\n<ol>\n<li>Qualtrics has not provided sufficient evidence of its compliance with the technical and organizational measures that protect the production systems of the Cloud Service through providing either: (i) a certification as to compliance with ISO 27001 or other standards (scope as defined in the certificate).\nor (ii) a valid ISAE3402 and/or ISAE3000 or other SOC1-3 attestation report.\nUpon Customer\u2019s request audit reports or ISO certifications are available through the third party auditor or Qualtrics;</li>\n<li>A Personal Data Breach has occurred;</li>\n<li>An audit is formally requested by Customer\u2019s data protection authority.\nor</li>\n<li>Mandatory Data Protection Law provides Customer with a direct audit right and provided that Customer shall only audit once in any twelve month period unless mandatory Data Protection Law requires more frequent audits.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other Controller Audit.</strong> Any other Controller may audit Qualtrics\u2019 control environment and security practices relevant to Personal Data processed by Qualtrics in line with Section 5.1 only if any of the cases set out in Section 5.1 applies to such other Controller.\nSuch audit must be undertaken through and by Customer as set out in Section 5.1 unless the audit must be undertaken by the other Controller itself under Data Protection Law.\nIf several Controllers whose Personal Data is processed by Qualtrics on the basis of the Agreement require an audit, Customer shall use all reasonable means to combine the audits and to avoid multiple audits.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Scope of Audit.</strong> Customer shall provide at least sixty days advance notice of any audit unless mandatory Data Protection Law or a competent data protection authority requires shorter notice.\nThe frequency and scope of any audits shall be mutually agreed between the parties acting reasonably and in good faith.\nCustomer audits shall be limited in time to a maximum of three business days.\nBeyond such restrictions, the parties will use current certifications or other audit reports to avoid or minimize repetitive audits.\nCustomer shall provide the results of any audit to Qualtrics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cost of Audits.</strong> Customer shall bear the costs of any audit unless such audit reveals a material breach by Qualtrics of this DPA, then Qualtrics shall bear its own expenses of an audit.\nIf an audit determines that Qualtrics has breached its obligations under the DPA, Qualtrics will promptly remedy the breach at its own cost.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>SUBPROCESSORS</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Permitted Use.</strong> Qualtrics is granted a general authorization to subcontract the processing of Personal Data to Subprocessors, provided that:\n<ol>\n<li>Qualtrics shall engage Subprocessors under a written (including in electronic form) contract consistent with the terms of this DPA in relation to the Subprocessor\u2019s processing of Personal Data.\nQualtrics shall be liable for any breaches by the Subprocessor in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;</li>\n<li>Qualtrics will evaluate the security, privacy and confidentiality practices of a Subprocessor prior to selection to establish that it is capable of providing the level of protection of Personal Data required by this DPA.\nand</li>\n<li>Qualtrics\u2019 list of Subprocessors in place on the effective date of the Agreement is published by Qualtrics or Qualtrics will make it available to Customer, upon request including the name, address and role of each Subprocessor Qualtrics uses to provide the Cloud Service.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>New Subprocessors.</strong> Qualtrics\u2019 use of Subprocessors is at its discretion, provided that:\n<ol>\n<li>Qualtrics will inform Customer in advance (by email or by posting within the Cloud Service) of any intended additions or replacements to the list of Subprocessors including name, address and role of the new Subprocessor.\nand</li>\n<li>Customer may object to such changes as set out in Section 6.3</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Objections to New Subprocessors.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>If Customer has a legitimate reason under Data Protection Law to object to the new Subprocessors\u2019 processing of Personal Data, Customer may terminate the Agreement (limited to the Cloud Service for which the new Subprocessor is intended to be used) on written notice to Qualtrics.\nSuch termination shall take effect at the time determined by the Customer which shall be no later than thirty days from the date of Qualtrics\u2019 notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor.\nIf Customer does not terminate within this thirty day period, Customer is deemed to have accepted the new Subprocessor.</li>\n<li>Within the thirty day period from the date of Qualtrics\u2019 notice to Customer informing Customer of the new Subprocessor, Customer may request that the parties come together in good faith to discuss a resolution to the objection.\nSuch discussions shall not extend the period for termination and do not affect Qualtrics\u2019 right to use the new Subprocessor(s) after the thirty day period.</li>\n<li>Any termination under this Section 6.3 shall be deemed to be without fault by either party and shall be subject to the terms of the Agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Emergency Replacement.</strong> Qualtrics may replace a Subprocessor without advance notice where the reason for the change is outside of Qualtrics\u2019 reasonable control and prompt replacement is required for security or other urgent reasons.\nIn this case, Qualtrics will inform Customer of the replacement Subprocessor as soon as possible following its appointment.\nSection 6.3 applies accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>INTERNATIONAL

clauses by sending a request to privacy@qualtrics.com.\nYou can also obtain more information from the European Commission on the international dimension of data protection here.</p>\n<p>While Qualtrics is certified under the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, Qualtrics no longer relies on Privacy Shield for transfers of Data to the US.\nFor more details about the

the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, respectively, including the onward transfer liability provisions.\nQualtrics has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.</p>\n<p>The key goals of Privacy Shield are to inform both EU and Swiss individuals about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the right of individuals to access their personal data</li>\n<li>the choices and means an organization offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal data</li>\n<li>the requirement for an organization to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Qualtrics\u2019 Privacy Shield self-certification does not cover human resources data.</p>\n<p>Privacy Shield may provide individuals the right to (i) access the data that we hold about them, (ii) request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield, or (iii) limit the use and disclosure of their personal information.\nIn compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Qualtrics commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of personal information.\nEU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Qualtrics at: privacy@qualtrics.com.</p>\n<p>Qualtrics has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the American Arbitration Association (AAA), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf an individual does not receive timely acknowledgment of its complaint from us, or if we have not addressed an individual\u2019s complaint satisfactorily, such individual should contact the AAA for more information or to file a complaint (contact details below).\nThe services of the AAA are provided at no cost.</p>\n<p>Because adequate protection is provided by Privacy Shield participants, contracts with Privacy Shield participants for mere processing do not require prior authorization (or such authorization will be granted automatically by the EU Member States), as would be required for contracts with recipients not participating in the Privacy Shield or otherwise not providing adequate protection.</p>\n<p>Qualtrics self-certifies with Privacy Shield.\nA self-assessment is signed by a company officer or other authorized representative of the organization at least once a year and made available upon request by individuals or in the context of an investigation or a complaint about non-compliance.\nQualtrics is required to respond promptly to EU or Swiss individual inquiries, and other requests for information from the Department of Commerce relating to its adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>Under Privacy Shield, an individual has the right, under certain conditions, to invoke binding arbitration for complaints regarding Privacy Shield compliance not resolved by any of the other Privacy Shield mechanisms.\nUnder

(iv) in case you object to the processing of your Personal Data by Qualtrics based on Qualtrics legitimate interest (as further set out below), subject to the time required for Qualtrics to determine whether it has a prevailing interest or legal obligation in processing your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>For individuals within the State of California, you instead have the right:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to request from Qualtrics access to your Personal Data that Qualtrics collects, uses, discloses, or sells (if applicable) about you;</li>\n<li>to request that Qualtrics deletes Personal Data about you;</li>\n<li>to opt-out of the sale of Personal Data, if applicable;</li>\n<li>to non-discriminatory treatment for exercise of any of your data protection rights;</li>\n<li>in case of request from Qualtrics for access to your Personal Data, for such information to be portable, if possible, in a readily usable format that allows you to transmit this information to another recipient without hindrance.</li>\n</ul>\nHow can you exercise your data protection rights?\n<p>Please direct any requests to exercise your rights to privacy@qualtrics.com, or, if you are located in the State of California, you can also call toll-free using the numbers provided here.\nYou can also designate another person to submit requests to exercise your data protection rights to Qualtrics.\nYou can give authorization to such person by granting them a limited power of attorney to exercise your data protection rights on your behalf.</p>\nHow will Qualtrics verify requests to exercise data protection rights?\n<p>Qualtrics will take sets to ensure that it verifies your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty before it will process the data protection right you want to exercise.\nWhen feasible, Qualtrics will match Personal Data provided by you in submitting a request to exercise your rights with information already maintained by Qualtrics.\nThis could include matching two or more data points that are already maintained by us.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the verification process set forth in the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), Qualtrics will require a more stringent verification process for deletion requests, or for Personal Data that is considered sensitive or valuable, to minimize the harm that might be posed to you by unauthorized access or deletion of your Personal Data.\nIf Qualtrics must request additional information from you outside of information that is already maintained by Qualtrics, Qualtrics will only use it for the purposes of verifying your identity so you can exercise your data protection rights, or for security and fraud-prevention purposes.</p>\n<p>Qualtrics will decline to process requests that are manifestly unfounded, excessive, fraudulent, or are not otherwise required by local law.</p>\n<p>If you take the view that Qualtrics is not processing your Personal Data in accordance with the requirements in this Privacy Statement or under applicable EEA data protection laws, you can at any time lodge a complaint with the data protection<br>\nauthority of the EEA country where you live.</p>\nB.\nProcessing based on a statutory permission\nWhy does Qualtrics need to use my Personal Data and on what legal basis is Qualtrics using it?\n<p>\n<b>Providing the requested services</b>.\nQualtrics requires your Personal Data to deliver services you order under a contract Qualtrics has with you, to establish a contract for goods or services between you and Qualtrics, and to send you invoices for ordered services.\nQualtrics processes Personal Data to fulfill contractual obligations pursuant to Article 6(1), Subparagraph 1(b) GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Ensuring compliance</b>.\nQualtrics and its products, technologies, and services are subject to the export laws, trade sanctions, and embargoes (\u201cExport Laws\u201d) of various countries including, without limitation, those of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), Germany and of the United States of America.\nTherefore, You acknowledge that, pursuant to the applicable Export Laws issued by these countries, Qualtrics is required to:</p>\n<p>(a) take measures to prevent persons, entities and organizations listed on government-issued sanctioned party lists from accessing certain products, technologies, and services through Qualtrics\u2019s websites or other delivery channels controlled by Qualtrics.\nThis may include (i) automated checks of any user registration data as set out herein and other information a user provides about his or her identity against applicable sanctioned-party lists.\n(ii) regular repetition of such checks whenever a sanctioned-party list is updated or when a user updates his or her information.\n(iii) blocking of access to Qualtrics\u2019s services and systems in case of a potential match.\nand (iv) contacting a user to confirm his or her identity in case of a potential match.\nand</p>\n<p>(b) ensure that no individuals from embargoed countries access its services.\nTherefore, when an existing user logs into a website, app or cloud service of Qualtrics from an embargoed country, the user\u2019s registration data and IP address may be used by Qualtrics to block the user\u2019s access and to log access attempts from embargoed countries.</p>\n<p>Any such usage of registration data and IP addresses by Qualtrics is necessary for Qualtrics\u2019 compliance with applicable EU Export Laws (Article 6 para.\n1 (c) GDPR) and Qualtrics\u2019s legitimate interest to comply with non-EU Export Laws (Article 6 para.\n1 (f) GDPR).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Qualtrics legitimate interest</b>.\nQualtrics can use your Personal Data based on its legitimate interest

activities such as fraud and to assert or defend against legal claims.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Questionnaires and surveys</b>.\nQualtrics could invite you to participate in questionnaires and surveys.\nThese questionnaires and surveys will be generally designed in a way that they can be answered without any data that can be used to identify you.\nIf you nonetheless enter such data in a questionnaire or survey, Qualtrics will use this personal data to improve its products and services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Contract performance</b>.\nIf you purchase or intend to purchase goods or services from Qualtrics on behalf of a corporate customer or otherwise be the nominated contact person for the business relationship between a corporate customer (a \u201cCustomer Contact\u201d) and Qualtrics, Qualtrics will use your Personal Data for this purpose.\nThis includes, for the avoidance of doubt, such steps which are required for establishing the relevant business relationship.\nIn case that an existing Customer Contact informs Qualtrics that you are his replacement, Qualtrics will, from the point in time of such notification, consider you to be the relevant Customer Contact for the respective customer until you object as further set out below.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Creation of anonymized data sets</b>.\nQualtrics will anonymize Personal Data provided under this Privacy Statement to create anonymized data sets, which will then be used to improve its and its affiliates\u2019 products and services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Personalized Newsletter</b>.\nIf you opt-in to receive marketing communications such as newsletters from Qualtrics, Qualtrics will collect and store details of how you interact with the newsletters to help create, develop, operate, deliver and improve our

quality improvement purposes</b>.\nIn case of telephone calls or chat sessions, Qualtrics will record such calls (after informing you accordingly during that call and before the recording starts or where you have opted in to have the call recorded via the Qualtrics Support Portal) or chat sessions in order to improve the quality of Qualtrics services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>To keep you up-to-date or request feedback</b>.\nWithin an existing business relationship between you and Qualtrics, Qualtrics might inform you, where permitted in accordance with local laws, about its products or services (including webinars, seminars or events) which are similar or relate to such products and services you have already purchased or used from Qualtrics.\nFurthermore, where you have attended a webinar, seminar or event of Qualtrics or purchased products or services from Qualtrics, Qualtrics might contact you for feedback regarding the improvement of the relevant webinar, seminar, event, product or service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can at any time object to Qualtrics\u2019 use of your Personal Data as set forth in this section by sending an email to privacy@qualtrics.com.\nIn this case, Qualtrics will carefully review your objection and cease further use of the relevant information, subject to Qualtrics\u2019 compelling legitimate grounds for continued use of the information, which override your interest in objecting, or if Qualtrics requires the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Processing under applicable national laws</b>.\nIf the applicable national law allows Qualtrics to do so, Qualtrics will use information about you for a business purpose, some of which is Personal Data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To plan and host events</li>\n<li>To

technological development and demonstration</li>\n<li>Undertaking activities to verify or maintain the quality or safety of a service or device that is owned, manufactured, manufactured for, or controlled by Qualtrics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In accordance with the disclosure requirements under the CCPA, Qualtrics is exempt from providing a notice to opt-out because it does not and will not sell
