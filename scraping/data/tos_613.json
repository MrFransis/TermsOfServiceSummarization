Policy <p>This privacy policy was last updated on July 28th, 2020.</p>\n<p>At Doodle, we\u2019re serious about the security of the data on our servers and the protection of the privacy of our users.\n&nbsp;We employ several security professionals that work exclusively on technical and organizational security during operations and further development of the product.\nYou can meet them on our team page.\nWe continually take steps to protect your information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, manipulation, or destruction.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a basic principle, the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FADP) applies to the processing of your personal data.\nIn certain circumstances, for example if you access our offers from a Member State of the European Union, the European Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) may also apply.\nIf you access our services from the State of California, USA, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) may also apply.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the data is handled at Doodle.\nPlease also consult our general data processing terms and your rights and disclosures required by the CCPA.</p>\nYour data at Doodle\n<p>When you use Doodle, you send pieces of data to Doodle.\nthis can be a name, an e-mail address, or information relating to your appointment.\nOther data is generated implicitly by your use of Doodle, e.g.\nlog data.\nWe use this information for internal analytical purposes to improve the product for you.\nFurthermore we employ other companies to perform tasks on our behalf and may need to share this information with them to provide services to you.\nWe do not sell your data to third parties.</p>\nLog data\n<p>Doodle records certain requests and transactions in log files.\nThis log data is used for troubleshooting, statistics, analytics, quality assurance, and to monitor system security and can be analyzed to that end.\nDoodle can publish anonymous statistics under the condition that no personally identifiable information can be derived from such statistics.</p>\n<p>Doodle also uses Google Analytics and Google Firebase Analytics (for iOS and Android apps) to compile usage statistics.\nThese services are provided by Space Pencil, Inc.\nand by Google, Inc., respectively.\nTheir privacy policies can be found at http://www.google.com/privacy and https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics.\nDoodle anonymizes IP addresses before they are sent to Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>Doodle also employs NET-Metrix and AGOF to certify its traffic statistics in Switzerland and Germany.\nDetailed information (in German) on how this certification works and what information is collected can be found here: NET-Metrix and AGOF.\nAn appendix at the end of the German version of this policy also provides further information on how information is collected for web traffic that originates from Germany.</p>\n<p>Doodle works with Crashlytics, Inc (\u201cCrashlytics\u201d) and Bit Stadium GmbH (\u201cHockeyApp\u201d) to report any bug affecting our iOS and Android Apps.\nHockeyApp\u2019s software is built into our iOS App and Crashlytics\u2019 software is built into our Android App.\nIf either app crashes during normal use, the app will send certain information about the incident to Crashlytics or HockeyApp as applicable.\nThis information consists of the device type, OS version and certain hardware information about your mobile device, and the time of the crash, the state of the application at the time of the crash, and stack traces.\nThe information does not include your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you or your mobile device individually, and does not include any other information from your mobile device.\nClick here to review Crashlytics\u2019 privacy policy, and here for HockeyApp\u2019s privacy policy.</p>\nCookies\n<p>When you use Doodle, the service can store cookies on your computer.\nCookies are little pieces of information that can help identify your browser and that can store information for future visits, e.g.\nyour language preferences.\nDoodle uses cookies to track usage, to improve ease-of-use and the overall user experience, and to manage advertising inventories.</p>\n<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.\nYou may however configure your browser at any time in such a manner that no cookies are saved on your computer or that an indication always appears when you receive a new cookie.</p>\n<p>Doodle\u2019s services may in principle be used without accepting cookies, although individual functions may thereby be limited.</p>\n<p>You can choose to disable cookies but this may limit your ability to use Doodle\u2019s service.</p>\nAdvertising\n<p>Advertising is one of Doodle\u2019s revenue streams.\nTherefore, Doodle displays advertisements on some of the services, e.g.\non certain web pages or in e-mails.\nThese advertisements can be targeted based on the information that is available to Doodle, e.g.\nlanguage, IP address, poll content, etc.\nThis targeting is always an automated process.\nnone of the information used for targeting is analyzed manually or made available to advertising customers.\nIn some cases, Doodle displays advertisements from Google\u2019s AdSense or AdExchange network.\nThese advertisements can be targeted based on the poll content.\nGoogle does not disclose that information and only uses it for the intended purpose.\nYou can review Google\u2019s Ads Privacy Policy here: http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/.\nFurthermore, you can use Google\u2019s Ads Preferences Manager to configure the right ads settings for you.\nWe also use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>\n<p>Doodle\u2019s paid services (Premium Doodle) are ad-free.</p>\nSocial Login\n<p>Doodle employs third party tools to provide you with the convenience you are used to from elsewhere on the internet to sign in to Doodle with one click (so called \u201csocial login\u201d).\nSome of these tools can track your actions when you interact with them.\nAt Doodle you can sign in with Google, Microsoft, Facebook or your email/password.\nPlease refer to the terms of the respective providers for further guidance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google https://policies.google.com/privacy</li>\n<li>Microsoft https://privacy.microsoft.com</li>\n<li>Facebook https://www.facebook.com/policy.php</li>\n</ul>\nOutdated and completed polls\n<p>You can delete outdated or completed (or, in fact, any) polls manually at any time using the admin link.\nWhen deleting a poll, that poll\u2019s information will be deleted from the Doodle application databases but may be archived in some other form for internal analytical purposes to improve the product for you.\nLog data will not be deleted.\nFurthermore, outdated polls are automatically deleted from time to time, but no earlier than 30 days after the last date in the poll, or 30 days after the last access to a poll without dates.\nPolls created with premium accounts will not be deleted automatically as long as the subscription remains active.\nShould the subscription expire, the deletion rules mentioned above apply to all polls associated to the account after 30 days of expiry.</p>\nInactive accounts\n<p>Doodle can delete user-accounts if they remain inactive (i.e.\nnot accessed) for 1 year or longer.</p>\nUnauthorized access\n<p>Doodle implements several mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to polls, accounts, or other data.</p>\n<p>To access a poll, you use the unique link which Doodle provides and which contains a random access code.\nThis link is an important element to prevent unauthorized access to a poll.\nYou should send this link only to authorized people, i.e., the people you wish to participate in your poll.</p>\n<p>User-accounts are protected by passwords.\nYou should choose a secure password and ensure its confidentiality to prevent unauthorized access to your account.</p>\nInviting from Doodle\n<p>As an option, you can contact and invite people to participate in a poll from Doodle.\nIn this case, Doodle needs to know the e-mail addresses of the people to be contacted.\nYou can enter these e-mail addresses in the corresponding form.\nDoodle stores these e-mail addresses in your user-account for your convenience.\nDoodle will be able to offer you the same contacts again next time you use the service.\nYou can have Doodle delete all stored e-mail addresses any time using the corresponding function in your user-account.</p>\n<p>General remark: Like all other personal information, Doodle will not share participants\u2019 e-mail addresses with third parties.\nDoodle will not send any e-mail communication to participants\u2019 e-mail addresses without a without a lawful ground.</p>\nContacts integration\n<p>As an alternative (or complement) to the Doodle contacts, you can use your existing Google contacts to gain access to the e-mail addresses of the people to be contacted.\nIn this case, you authorize Doodle to access your Google contacts.\nYour Google contacts will still be stored at Google.\nPlease note also: The process of accessing your Google contacts is set up (thanks to OAuth) to make sure that Doodle at no time has access to your Google password.</p>\nCalendar integration\n<p>You can connect Doodle with your calendar to make the scheduling process even easier and more efficient.\nThere are two types of calendars: online and offline.</p>\n<p>Online calendars like Google calendar are constantly accessible via their respective interfaces.\nDoodle can store certain calendar data to improve performance (caching) and to personalise scheduling.</p>\n<p>In either case, calendar data on Doodle can be deleted at any time.</p>\nCommunication between you and Doodle\n<p>If you send Doodle a message, this message can be stored to process it, to compile statistical information, to improve our services and support, or to get in touch with you.</p>\nFor user surveys and market research\n<p>We use the data you provide exclusively to improve the user experience and to further develop our products.\nThe results consist solely of aggregated and anonymous data.\nIf you have given your consent, you may also be contacted by other companies of the TX Group for example to participate in other user surveys.</p>\nPayment processing\n<p>Doodle supports the leading payment processing provider, PayPal.\nYou can find their privacy policies here: PayPal.\nTo make payments as easy and user-friendly as possible, Doodle sends your name and e-mail address to Paypal during a payment process.\nAll this information would be requested by the provider anyway.\nDoodle furthermore employs Stripe for credit card payments.\nYou can find the privacy policy here.</p>\nLocation of data\n<p>The Doodle databases are located on cloud servers in Ireland and Frankfurt.</p>\nTransfer of Personal Data abroad\n<p>We are entitled to transfer your Personal Data abroad, including to third party companies (designated service providers) insofar as this is expedient for the Data Processing described in this Privacy Statement.\nThe recipients will be obliged to protect Your Data to the same extent as ourselves.\nIf the level of data protection in a particular country is lower than that applicable in Switzerland, we will ensure under contract that the level of protection for your Personal Data is equivalent to that applicable in Switzerland.\nWe shall ensure this through one or more of the following measures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by concluding EU Model Clauses with the appointed service providers, cf.\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_de</li>\n<li>through

cf.\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/binding-corporate-rules_en</li>\n</ul>\nSharing personal information\n<p>Doodle uses personal information

your consent.\n(ii) Doodle has good faith that there is a legal obligation to share the data.\n(iii) Doodle needs to access or share the data to protect the security of the service or of others users\u2019 data.\n(iv) Doodle needs to access or share the data to protect Doodle\u2019s rights and property or to enforce the Terms of Service.</p>\nData retention\n<p>We shall only retain Your Data for as long as is legally necessary or in accordance with the purpose for which they were Processed.\nIf we carry out analyses, we shall store Your Data until the analysis has been concluded.\nIf we store Your Data on the basis of a contractual relationship with you, these data will remain stored for at least the duration of the contractual relationship and at most for the duration of the limitation periods within which any claims may be brought by or against us, or for the duration of statutory or contractual duties of retention.</p>\nLegal basis\n<p>We shall only process your Personal Data in accordance with principles of data protection and if there is a legal basis to do so.\nIf in furtherance of the establishment or implementation of our contract, it shall serve as the legal basis.\nOtherwise, we have an interest in continuously improving our Offers, adjusting our Offers in line with your needs and showing you advertising that may be of interest to you.\nThis is necessary in order to develop our Offers further, as well as to be able to finance and guarantee the security of our Offers.\nWe act on the presumption that our interests are predominant.\nIf you have consented to data Processing, this consent will apply.</p>\nRight of erasure\n<p>In accordance with applicable European legislation you can delete your account and the events you own from the system in the account section of Sites.\nIt is however possible that another user invites, or informs, you about an event again in the future.\nIf you don\u2019t want this either we can block your email address.</p>\nYour rights\n<p>You have the right to exercise Your Data protection rights at any time and to request information as to whether and which Personal Data relating to you has been processed
