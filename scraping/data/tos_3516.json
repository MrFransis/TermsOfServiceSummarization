the third party payment provider or the app store directly.</b>\n</li>\n</ul>\n4.\nCan I transfer Virtual Items between app and website accounts?\nGenerally, no.\nThe app and website accounts are not always linked, but in some cases, such as for 8 Ball Pool, the Coin wallets are linked.\nHowever, for some games there is no link, and if you purchase Virtual Items through one platform account, they will not appear in other platform accounts you may have with us.<br>\n<br>\n5.\nHow do I use my Virtual Items?\nYou can spend your Coins in order to acquire other Virtual Items within the game within

in any manner that is contrary to the general purpose of a game.\nIt is strictly prohibited to give, sell or otherwise transfer an account or any Virtual Items to any person.<br>\n<br> We may from

and for different periods of time (the \"Subscription Period\") as specified in the Services at the point of purchase.\nThese Subscription Terms and Conditions apply to all such purchases of Subscriptions.<br>\n<br>\n2.\nWhat legal terms do I need to be aware of for Subscriptions?\nSubscriptions are automatic regular payments that continue for the Subscription Period until cancelled.<br>\n<br> Subscription fees are charged automatically on or before the beginning of each Subscription Period.\nApple's App Store, Google's Google Play or Amazon platform may place a temporary \"authorisation hold\" or \"pending charge\" on your payment card before any payment is due (including during a free trial period).\nPlease see the section below \"Why has my payment card been charged before payment is due?\" for further details.<br>\n<br>\n<b>A Subscription is automatically renewed at the end of each Subscription Period unless you cancel it at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period.</b> If you do not cancel the Subscription at least 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period, the Subscription fees for the next Subscription Period will be taken during the 24 hours before the expiry of the current Subscription Period.<br>\n<br> If a Subscription fee cannot be taken due to the absence of monetary funds, invalidity of credit card or for any other reasons, the Subscription will not automatically end.\nThe Subscription will automatically restart as soon as valid payment details are provided.\nCancellation of a Subscription can only be done at your manual request.\nPlease see the section below \"How can I cancel a Subscription\" for further details.<br>\n<br>\n3.\nWhat is a trial period?\nSome of our Subscriptions offer a trial period which is free of charge for a certain period of time that is specified in the Services.\nAt the end of such trial period, the Subscription will automatically convert into a paid Subscription for the fees and for the Subscription Period set out in the Services at the time of activation of the trial period.\nIf you do not cancel the Subscription within the trial period therefore, the first Subscription fee will be immediately and automatically charged when the trial period expires.<br>\n<br> Please note that any paid Subscription begins immediately from the activation of such paid Subscription and not after the expiry of any trial period.\nAny unused trial period will therefore be forfeited if a Subscription is activated prior to the expiry of such trial period.<br>\n<br> Unless otherwise stated, each trial period offer may only be used once on an account.\nWe are entitled to temporarily or permanently ban any account that abuse free trial periods (including, without limitation, any user activating multiple trial periods on the same account).<br>\n<br>\n4.\nCan I cancel my order once I have bought a Subscription?\nYou cannot cancel your Subscription for the current Subscription Period as that is activated as soon as you purchase a Subscription.\nHowever, you may cancel your Subscription for the next Subscription Period following the steps set out below.<br>\n<br>\n5.\nHow can I cancel a Subscription?\nYou can manage and cancel your subscriptions at any time in the Account Settings of your device.\nFor iOS subscriptions, please see Apple's support page here.\nFor Google Play subscriptions, please see Google Play's support page here.\nFor Amazon subscriptions, please see Amazon's support page here.<br>\n<br>\n6.\nWhat happens when my Subscription ends?\nYou will immediately stop receiving any benefits such as \"VIP access\" that your Subscription provided including any regular free Virtual Items.\nYou will also lose access to any Virtual Items that is only available for Subscribers.<br>\n<br>\n7.\nAre Subscription fees refundable?\nNo.\nExcept where required by law or at our sole discretion, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.<br>\n<br>\n8.\nCan Subscription fees change?\nWe may modify the Subscription fee at our sole discretion and at any time.\nAny Subscription Fee change will become effective at the end of the current Subscription period.\nYou will be provided reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fee.\nIf you disagree with the change in Subscription fee, you may cancel your Subscription for the next Subscription Period following the steps set out in the section \"How can I cancel a Subscription?\".<br>\n<br>\n9.\nCan Subscription content change?\nYes, we may modify the rewards and perks of each Subscription in our Services at our sole discretion.<br>\n<br>\n10.\nWhy do I still see advertising when I purchase a \"remove ads\" Subscription?\nWe use different types of advertising in our Services.\nWhen you purchase a Subscription that states that advertising is removed from a particular Service, it will not remove advertising that you choose to display.\nThis includes rewarded video advertising which is only shown when you select the option to display it.<br>\n<br>\n11.\nWhy has my payment card been charged before payment is due?\nAll payment, billing and transaction processes are handled by the relevant third party distributor or platform such as Apple's App Store or Google's Google Play.\nHowever, we understand that these platforms may place a temporary \"authorisation hold\" or \"pending charge\" on your payment card before any payment is due (including during a free trial period).\nThis is an action outside of Miniclip's control for the purposes of preventing credit card fraud but we understand no payment is actually taken from you until the 24 period prior to the commencement of a paid subscription period.<br>\n<br>\n12.\nI have an issue with my Subscription.\nWho do I contact?\nAll payment, billing and transaction processes are handled by the relevant third party distributor or platform such as Apple's App Store, Google's Google Play or Amazon.\nIf you have any payment related issues, then you need to contact such distributors directly.\nFor any other issues, please contact
