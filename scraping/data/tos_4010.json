before one arbitrator.\nArbitration proceedings will be held in King County, Washington or may be conducted telephonically or via video conference for disputes alleging damages less than S10,000, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cJAMS Rules\u201d).\nThe most recent version of the JAMS Rules is available on the JAMS website and is hereby incorporated

should not apply for any reason.\n</p>\n<p>You and Sugar Mountain agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 13 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1, et seq.\n(the \u201cFAA\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nAs limited by the FAA, these Terms and the

including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.\nThe arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.\n</p>\n<p>The arbitrator, Sugar Mountain, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.\nThe duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.\n</p>\n<p>You and Sugar Mountain agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Sugar Mountain will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.\nFor any arbitration initiated by Sugar Mountain, Sugar Mountain will pay all JAMS fees and costs.\nYou and Sugar Mountain

arbitration award.\n</p>\n<p>Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sites or a Product must be filed within one year after such claim arose.\notherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Sugar Mountain will not have the right to assert the claim.\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 13 by sending a written opt-out notice to Sugar Mountain by email at customerlove@beecherscheese.com with \u201cArbitration Opt-out\u201d in the subject line.\nIn order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.\nBy opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 14.\n</p>\n<p>If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.\n(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 13 or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 13.\nand (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.\nFurther, if any part of this Section 13 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforceable.\n</p>\n<p>14.\nGoverning Law and Venue</p>\n<p>Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Sites or a Product will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Washington, except to the extent preempted by U.S.\nfederal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of Washington or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\nAny dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of Washington and the United States, respectively, sitting in King County, Washington.\n</p>\n<p>15.\nModifying and Terminating the Sites</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to modify the Sites or to suspend or stop providing all or portions of the Sites at any time.\nYou also have the right to stop using the Sites at any time.\nWe are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use the Sites.\n</p>\n<p>16.\nInterpretation</p>\n<p>In these terms, the terms \u201cincluding\u201d and \u201cinclude\u201d will mean \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d and references to a \u201cSection\u201d will mean a section of these Terms, unless otherwise expressly stated.\nAll section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\n</p>\n<p>17.\nSeverability</p>\n<p>If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\n</p>\n<p>18.\nMiscellaneous</p>\n<p>The failure of Sugar Mountain to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nExcept as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.\nYou agree that communications and transactions between us may be conducted electronically.\nUnder California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California consumers are entitled to the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of
