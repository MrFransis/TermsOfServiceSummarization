outside the EU, that is your data may be transferred outside of the country from which it was originally collected.\nPlease be aware that countries which are outside the EU/EEA may not offer the same level of data protection as the EU/EEA, although our collection, storage and use of your personal information will continue to be governed by this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>When transferring personal data outside the EU/EEA, we will ensure that the country in which your personal data will be handled has been deemed \u201cadequate\u201d by the EU Commission under Article 45 of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201c<strong>GDPR</strong>\u201d) or if your personal data will be transferred to a country which the EU Commission does not consider to have an adequate level of protection for personal data, we will take all necessary steps required under applicable law in order for such transfer of information across borders to be compliant with applicable law.\nWe will only transfer your personal data to a country outside the EU/EEA where.\n(i) the transfer is being safeguarded by the use of EU model clauses (under Article 46.2 in the GDPR) or (ii) where the recipient is certified under the US-EU Privacy Shield Framework (under Article 45 in the GDPR).</p>\n<p>By installing or using the App, you consent to those transfers of information to other countries and to

Service and our Website contain links and pages to other websites operated by third parties.\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the personal data that we collect through the Service and our Website and we cannot be responsible for personal data that third parties may collect, store and use through their website when you are directed to such other websites.\nThe privacy policy of each such third party website will govern the information collected from you on that third party website.\ntherefore, you should always read the privacy policy of each such website you visit carefully.</p>SECURITY<p>We take all reasonable technical and organisational measures in order to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access and any other unlawful forms of processing.</p>\n<p>Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data that you provide to us, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed secure.\nConsequently, please note that we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us.</p>NOTICE OF CHANGES<p>If we make changes to this Privacy Policy we will notify you by publication on our webpage.\nIf the changes are material, we will provide you additional, prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances and, where required under applicable law, ask for your consent.</p>YOUR RIGHTS<p>You have the right to, at any time, receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you and information about the processing.</p>\n<p>You have the right to, without undue delay, have incorrect or irrelevant personal data about you corrected and taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data about you completed.</p>\n<p>You have the right to have your personal data deleted without undue delay and we are obliged to delete your personal data without undue delay if, for example one of the following grounds applies: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which they were collected or otherwise processed, or if you withdraw consent on which the processing is based and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.\nPlease note that we are not obliged to delete the personal data if we can show that the processing is necessary, for example, for compliance with a legal obligation to which Instabridge is subject, such as book-keeping rules or the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim, or when there are other legitimate grounds to keep the data.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, you have the right to request that Instabridge restricts the processing of your personal data under certain conditions, for example if you contest the accuracy of the personal data, the processing may be restricted for a period enabling Instabridge to verify the accuracy of the personal data or if Instabridge no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing but you require the personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>\n<p>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to Instabridge\u2019s processing of your personal data if the processing is based on, for example, legitimate interests, including marketing and/or profiling based on a legitimate interest.\nIf you object to such processing, Instabridge will no longer be entitled to process your personal data based on such legal basis, unless Instabridge can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights and freedom or if it is conducted for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.</p>\n<p>You have, under certain conditions, the right to receive the personal data concerning you and which you have provided to Instabridge, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit such personal data to another data controller without Instabridge trying to prevent this, where Instabridge\u2019s processing of your personal data is based on your consent or on a contract and the processing is carried out by automated means.\nYou have in such case the right to request that the personal data from Instabridge shall be transmitted directly to another data controller, where technically feasible.</p>\n<p>You also have the right to, at any time, withdraw your consent given to Instabridge for the processing of your personal data e.g.\nfor marketing purposes.\nIf you withdraw your consent, please note that this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal and that Instabridge may, under certain circumstances, have another legal ground for the processing and therefore may be entitled to continue the processing.</p>\n<p>If you are unhappy with our processing of your personal data and/or consider it to be in contrary to applicable legislation you may lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory data protection authority (\u201cDPA\u201d) (such as with the DPA in your country of residence, the DPA in the country of your place of work or the DPA in the country where the alleged infringement has occurred).</p>\n<p>To exercise the aforementioned rights please contact us at the following address:&nbsp;support@degoo.com&nbsp;or Degoo Backup AB, Vasagatan 16, 111 20 Stockholm.\nIn order to ensure that you receive a swift response, please state in your letter your full name and, if applicable, your address, user name and the email address used for registration.\nWe may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.</p>LANGUAGE<p>This Privacy Policy was written in English.\nIf you are reading a translation and it
