Statement</b>\u201d) explains rights that California consumers may have under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201c<b>CCPA</b>\u201d).</p>\n<p>When we use the term \u201c<b>personal

information does <u>not</u> include publicly available, deidentified, or aggregate consumer information (which are all defined in CCPA).\nNotably, the definition of \u201c<b>personal

our Services for you, business owners, directors, officers, medical staff, or contractors.</p>\nCategories of personal information we collect, the sources of that information, purposes for why we

process your personal information), we may be required to disclose additional information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, the sources where we obtain that information, the purposes for why we collect that information, who we share that information with, as well as whether we sell that personal information \u2013 all of which depends on the specific Service.\nAccordingly, we\u2019ve provided additional Service-specific information for subject Services on our website located at tr.com/privacy-information.</p>\nYour privacy rights<br>\n<p>If you

request additional information to complete the verification process, such as, for example, a copy of your driver\u2019s license and/or a recent utility or credit card bill.\nYou can designate an agent to make a request on your behalf by either: (1) having your agent send us a letter, signed by you, certifying that the agent is acting on your behalf and showing proof that they are registered with

products or services, which may be supplemented by third parties as discussed below.\nWe deliver interest-based advertising on Thomson Reuters\u2019s owned and operated sites, on unaffiliated sites, and through our Services.</p>\n<p>Like other online advertising networks, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to enable us to learn about what ads you are served, what ads you click,

been shown ads, your Ad Stats, and/or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p>\n<p>Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites or Services directly to your browser.\nThey automatically receive your IP address and/or information from

advertising identifier that gives companies the ability to serve targeted ads to a specific mobile device.\nDepending on your specific device, you may be able to limit advertising or reset the advertising identifier within your mobile device privacy settings.\nAnother tool you can use to control advertising on your mobile device is the AppChoices App:
