information you provide.\nThis information may be available to anyone with access to the servers.\n</p>\nPrivate logging\n<p>Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server.\nMost web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.\nIt is not the intention of ShoutWiki to use this information to keep track of legitimate users.\n</p>\n<p>These logs are used to produce the site statistics pages.\nthe raw log data is not made public, and is normally discarded after about three weeks.\n</p>\n<p>Here's a sample of what's logged for one page view:\n</p>\n192.168.2.3 - -

(KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5\" <p>Log data may be examined by server administrators in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site.\nIP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the wiki, including the suspected use of malicious \"sockpuppets\" (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruption of the wiki.\n</p>\nE-mail and IRC\n<p>E-mail: You may provide your e-mail address in your Preferences and enable other logged-in users to send email to you through the wiki.\nYour address will not be revealed to them unless you respond, or possibly if the email bounces.\n</p>\n<p>If you do not provide an email address, you will not be able to reset your password if you forget it.\nHowever, you may contact one of ShoutWiki staff members to enter a new mail address in your preferences.\n</p>\n<p>You can remove your email address from your preferences at any time to prevent it being used.\n</p>\n<p>IRC channels are not officially part of ShoutWiki proper.\nBy participating in an IRC channel, your IP address may be exposed to other participants.\nDifferent channels have different policies on whether logs may be published.\n</p>\n<p>Data on users, such as the times at which they edited and the number of edits they have made are publicly available via \"user contributions\" lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users.\n</p>\nUse of the ShoutWiki sites\n<p>Use of websites hosted by ShoutWiki is at your own risk.\n</p>\n<p>Users of this service may not act in a way on ShoutWiki which would be harmful to minors.\nUsers of this service may not impersonate any other person or entity without good reason.\n</p>\n<p>Users may not harass other users or collect or publish personal information about them without their permission.\n</p>\n<p>ShoutWiki may terminate your use of the site, and administrators within each wiki may terminate your ability to edit the

to the service without approval.\n</p>\nDisclaimer of warranties\n<p>Except in those jurisdictions which do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, ShoutWiki expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind and shall not be liable for any damages or losses whether directly or indirectly related to your use of this site or its content.\n</p>\nLegal action\n<p>You agree to indemnify ShoutWiki,
