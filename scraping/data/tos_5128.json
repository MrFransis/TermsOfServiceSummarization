categories of personal data.\nA category includes several personal<br>\ndata, which are usually processed together for the purposes.</p>\n<p>Personal data is information that can identify you or even make you<br>\nidentifiable.</p>\n<p>We generally process the following categories of personal data for the<br>\nfollowing reasons:</p>\nContact Information:\n<p>Name, address, telephone number, email address, your ID from any social<br>\nmedia (if applicable).<br>\nReason:<br>\nIf you contact us, we collect this data because we need to know who we are<br>\ntalking to and what we have been talking about so that we can help you with<br>\nyour reason for contacting us.\nThis also applies if you leave comments on<br>\nsocial media on our fan pages.\nWe do not combine this data with your profile<br>\ndata on our platform, but we can still identify you by your social media ID.</p>\nLocation data:\n<p>Address, Postcode, City, Country, Longitude, Latitude<br>\nReason:<br>\nWe need these data to be able to deliver your orders.\nWe create the<br>\nlongitude and latitude automatically in order to be able to process your<br>\ndelivery address in our other linked systems, such as our Rider app, and to<br>\ndisplay your address to our riders or riders of restaurants or shops.</p>\nProfile data (master data):\n<p>Name, email address, password, telephone number, delivery addresses,<br>\ninterests, demographic data (age, delivery address)<br>\nReason:<br>\nThis data is your master data, which we absolutely need for our services.<br>\nWithout an email address / telephone number and a password, you cannot<br>\ncreate a profile.\nTogether with your name, this is your master data.\nWe need<br>\nyour age to ensure that you are not a minor.</p>\nDevice information and access data:\n<p>Device ID, device identification, operating system and corresponding<br>\nversion, time of access, configuration settings, information on Internet<br>\nconnection (IP address)<br>\nReason:<br>\nWith each access this information is stored by us for technical reasons.\nWe<br>\nalso use parts of this information to detect suspicious behavior at an early<br>\nstage and to avert damage.</p>\nOrder information:\n<p>Order history, selected restaurants or shops, invoices, order ID, comments<br>\non orders, information on payment method, delivery address, successful<br>\norders and cancelled orders<br>\nReason:<br>\nEach time you place an order, this information will be added to your<br>\nprofile.\nYou can view all this information in your profile at any time.\nThe<br>\ninformation should give you an overview of your own interests and previous<br>\norders.\nWe will also use the same information to improve our services.\nIn<br>\naddition, we will anonymize this information when you request a deletion or<br>\nwhen your profile becomes inactive in order to continue to use this<br>\ninformation in an anonymized form to optimize our services.</p>\nCommunication data\n<p>Name, email address, telephone number, device ID<br>\nReason:<br>\nIf you would like to receive a newsletter, an SMS or an in-app push<br>\nnotification from us, we need certain information to send you the messages.<br>\nInstead of addressing you with \u201cHey You\u201d, we find it more customer<br>\nfriendly to address you with your name.\nThis category of personal<br>\ninformation is also used by us to contact you, for example, if a product<br>\ncannot be delivered and we want to offer you an alternative instead.<br>\nSimilarly, to make the online ads you may see from us more relevant, we may<br>\nuse this data.</p>\nPayment information:\n<p>Payment method, pseudonymized credit card information<br>\nReason:<br>\nWe need this information to track your payments and assign them to the<br>\norders you have placed.</p>\nDelivery information:\n<p>Name, delivery address, phone number, order ID<br>\nReason:<br>\nIn accordance with the principle of data minimization, we only provide our<br>\nriders and partners with the information that they need from you to prepare<br>\nand deliver your order.</p>\nFOR WHICH PURPOSES WE PROCESS DATA\n<p>We

consent.</p>\nAccount creation, SSO registration, administration of your profile\n<p>In order to be able to offer you our services, the processing of your<br>\npersonal data is essential.\nMuch of this data you transmit to us and other<br>\nparts of the data we collect automatically when using our platforms.<br>\nNevertheless, we endeavor to keep the amount of data as small as possible.<br>\nYou can help us by only sharing necessary data with us that we need to<br>\nfulfill our contractual obligations.</p>\nAccount creation\n<p>When creating a customer account, you will be asked to enter your master<br>\ndata.\nThis is absolutely necessary, as we cannot create a customer profile<br>\nwithout this data.\nYour email address and telephone number are particularly<br>\nimportant, as we can use this information to identify you in our system the<br>\nnext time you want to log in again.\nFurthermore, we would like to ask you to<br>\nchoose your password carefully.\nDo not use the same password on multiple<br>\nwebsites.\nYour password should also be at least 12 characters long, at least<br>\none lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one

understand the types of actions people take on their<br>\npages (\u201cPage Insights\u201d).</p>\n<p>When you visit or interact with a Page or its content, information such as<br>\nthe following may be collected and used to create Page Insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Viewing a Page, or a post or video from a Page</li>\n<li>Following or unfollowing a Page</li>\n<li>Liking or unliking a Page or

your data mainly within the European Union (EU) and the European<br>\nEconomic Area (EEA).\nHowever, some of our service providers mentioned above<br>\nare based outside the EU and the EEA.\nThe GDPR has high requirements for the<br>\ntransfer of personal data to third countries.\nAll our data receivers have to<br>\nmeasure up to these requirements.\nBefore we transfer your data to a service<br>\nprovider in third countries, every service provider is first assessed with<br>\nregard to its data protection level.\nOnly if they can demonstrate an<br>\nadequate level of data protection will they be shortlisted for service<br>\nproviders.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether our service providers are located within the EU/EEA or<br>\nin third countries, each service provider must sign a data processing<br>\nagreement with us.\nService providers outside the EU/EEA must meet additional<br>\nrequirements.\nAccording to Art.\n44 ff.\nGDPR personal data may be transferred<br>\nto service providers that meet at least one of the following requirements:</p>\n<p>a.\nCommission has decided that the third country ensures an adequate level<br>\nof protection (e.g.\nIsrael and Canada).</p>\n<p>b.\nStandard data protection clauses have been accepted.Contractual clauses<br>\nwhich cannot be modified by the contracting parties and in which they<br>\nundertake to ensure an adequate level of data protection are recognized by<br>\nthe GDPR as a suitable transfer mechanism.</p>\n<p>c.\nFurther appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art.\n46 GDPR have been<br>\nimplemented.: The GDPR also permits data transfers in other situations, e.g.<br>\nwhere a recipient has accepted the terms of binding corporate rules or<br>\napproved certification mechanisms, or where a data subject has granted their<br>\nconsent.</p>\n<p>We will only transfer your data to service providers who meet at least one<br>\nof these requirements.\nIf we transfer data to third countries, these are<br>\nmainly companies based in the USA or Israel.</p>\nHOW LONG WE STORE YOUR DATA\n<p>We generally delete your data after the purpose has been fulfilled.\nThe<br>\nexact deletion rules are defined in our regional deletion concepts.<br>\nDifferent deletion rules apply depending on the purpose of the processing.<br>\nWithin our deletion concepts we have defined various data classes and<br>\nassigned rule deletion periods to them.\nThe data collected is marked with a<br>\ndeletion rule.\nWhen the retention period is met, the stored data will be<br>\ndeleted accordingly.</p>\n<p>We will delete your personal data either if you wish and let us know or if<br>\nyour account is inactive for three years, we will also delete your account.<br>\nBefore this happens, you will receive a separate notification from us to the<br>\nemail address registered in your user account.</p>\n<p>In addition to the deletion rules defined by us, there are other legal<br>\nretention periods which we must also observe.\nFor example, tax data must be<br>\nkept for a period of between six and ten years or even longer in some cases.<br>\nThese special retention periods vary according to local legal requirements.</p>\n<p>Therefore, despite your request for deletion of your data, we may still have<br>\nto store some of the stored data due to legal regulations.\nIn this case,<br>\nhowever, we will restrict data from further processing.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we will continue to store your data if we have a right to do so<br>\nin accordance with Art.\n17 Para.\n3 GDPR.\nThis applies in particular if we<br>\nneed your personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal<br>\nclaims.</p>\nCOOKIES AND WEB-TRACKING POLICY\n<p>In
