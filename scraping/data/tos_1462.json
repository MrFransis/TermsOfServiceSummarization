We hope you have a great time playing games and doing other cool things via GOG.COM and GOG GALAXY Application.\nWe've put a lot of work into building GOG.COM and GOG GALAXY Application and as a result we need to have some rules about how you can access and use GOG services.\nSo, we've put this Agreement together as simply as we legally can, with some short summaries to help you understand what it means.\nHowever, please be aware that the full text wording is what is important/binding legally.</p>\n&nbsp.\nLEGALLY BINDING VERSION \"ENGLISH\" VERSION\" 1.\nABOUT THIS AGREEMENT <p>1.1 This Agreement is a contract between you and GOG sp.\nz o.o., ul.\nJagiello\u0144ska 74, 03-301 Warsaw, Poland (we will further call ourselves \u201cGOG\u201d) and applies to www.GOG.COM, your GOG user account, GOG GALAXY Application (including GOG GALAXY Store), any games or videos or other content or services which you purchase or access via us, the GOG web forums, GOG customer and technical support and other services we provide to you (we'll just call all this \u201cGOG services\u201d for short).</p>\n<p>This agreement explains how you can access and use GOG services, like GOG.COM, GOG GALAXY Application or GOG games and video content.</p>\n<p>1.2.\nAdditional terms may apply to GOG services and in such a case we will post them for your acceptance.\nFor example, if you would like to use the GOG GALAXY Application or play GWENT: The Witcher Card Game, the relevant terms will be posted for your acceptance before you start using these services.</p>\n<p>1.3 Also, when we're talking about games, in-game content, virtual items or currency or GOG videos or other content or services which you can purchase or access via GOG services, we\u2019ll just call them \u201cGOG games\u201d or \u201cGOG videos\u201d respectively and when we talk about them all together they are \u201cGOG content\u201d.\nSimple, eh? Oh, and one more thing \u2013 what we say in this Agreement covers our Privacy Policy too (you can read it here), so the Privacy Policy is part of this Agreement.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>1.4.\nGOG works with trusted partners, including our related company CD PROJEKT S.A., developers and publishers, payment providers, customer service software providers and others (\u201cPartners\u201d) \u2013 more on them later in this Agreement.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>1.5 If you're over 18, then welcome! If you're between 16 and 18, before we extend an equally warm welcome, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve this Agreement on your behalf (because in some countries people under a certain age cannot legally enter into contracts like this Agreement).\nIf you\u2019re not 16 yet you cannot have a GOG account or use the GOG services because legally we cannot handle personal data of children without a special parental or guardian\u2019s permission (but your parents/guardians are welcome to sign up themselves).</p>\n<p>If you are not yet 18 years old you need parental/ guardian approval to use GOG services.\nWe know it sounds kind of silly \u2013 no, no \u2013 it is not our invention, but actually a legal requirement</p> 2.\nUSING GOG SERVICES AND GOG CONTENT <p>2.1 We give you and other GOG users the personal right (known legally as a 'licence') to use GOG services and to download, access and/or stream (depending on the content) and use GOG content.\nThis licence is for your personal use.\nWe can stop or suspend this licence in some situations, which are explained later on</p>\n<p>You have the personal right to use GOG content and services.\nThis right can be suspended or stopped by us in some situations.</p>\n<p>2.2 When you buy, access or install GOG games, you might have to agree to additional contract terms with the developer/publisher of the game (e.g.\nthey might ask you to agree to a game specific End User Licence Agreement).\nIf there is any inconsistency or dispute between those \u2018EULAs\u2019 and this Agreement, then this Agreement wins.</p>\n<p>GOG games might have extra EULAs (End User Licensing Agreement) for you to accept.</p>\n<p>2.3 With GOG videos, you can also stream purchased video content or download it to watch the way you want.</p>\n<p>As for the video content, stream or download it and watch the way you want.</p>\n<p>2.4 Using certain third-party scripts is recommended for your full use of GOG functionality and, although that usage is optional, we cannot promise full service performance without them.</p>\n<p>You can (optionally) use certain third-party scripts to improve website performance \u2013 don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t mean anything fiendish here! Just regular website scripts.</p>\n<p>2.5 A quick word about GOG GALAXY Application, which is our (optional) online service which not only allows you to buy and access GOG content but also provides cool features like unified game library, and one friends list across platforms, online multiplayer, achievements, cross-platform chat, game-time tracking, cloud-saves and game overlay.\nGOG GALAXY Application includes GOG GALAXY Store that allows you to purchase selected games from different platforms and to access such games directly on a partner gaming platform without the need to redeem any code (we will call it: Keyless Access).\nYou can learn more about it here</p>\n<p>You can use GOG GALAXY Application, which is optional and contains cool features like bringing all your games and friends in one place, online multiplayer and much more!</p> 3.\nGOG ACCOUNT <p>3.1 To buy GOG content from GOG services, and in some cases to play/use GOG content where our partners require use of a GOG account, you will need to set up a GOG account.\nThis will involve creating a password (which is encrypted so we can\u2019t access it) and a username, plus giving us (for identification purposes) your email address.\nPlease make sure your login credentials are kept secure and your account is used properly.\nIn your GOG account settings you can also optionally set your country of residence, birthday and avatar.\nOur Privacy Policy gives more detail about the information we collect from you and how we use it and protect it.\nIt's here.</p>\n<p>To buy GOG content you will need to set up a GOG account.\nMake sure to keep your password safe! Check out our Privacy Policy too (link opposite).</p>\n<p>3.2 You can use your GOG account to set up a public profile accessible by other people.\nYou can also use your GOG account to connect with other GOG users.\nPlease act sensibly and remember you are responsible for your own actions.</p>\n<p>Your GOG account will have a public profile and you can communicate with other GOG users.\nBe sensible and careful!</p>\n<p>3.3 Your GOG account and GOG content are personal to you and cannot be shared with, sold, gifted or transferred to anyone else.\nYour access to and use of them is subject to GOG\u2019s rules which are set out here, as updated or amended when necessary</p>\n<p>Your GOG account and content are for you only \u2013 there are rules about how to use them (see opposite).</p>\n<p>3.4.\nAccess to and use of the games purchased with Keyless Access via our cool feature - GOG GALAXY Store (including minimum system requirements) is governed by respective third-party platform policies and (as applicable) additional contract terms with the developer/publisher of the game (e.g.\nthey might ask you to agree to a game specific End User Licence Agreement).\nIt may require having a third-party platform account.\nThese platforms may roll out patches or updates for your purchased games.</p>\n<p>If you purchase games with Keyless Access to a partner gaming platform you may be required to have a third-party platform account.\nOther requirements may apply (see opposite).</p> 4.\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS <p>4.1 Because GOG gives you access to many different services and games created at different times and via different platforms, we cannot give you one set of system requirements for all GOG services or GOG content.</p>\n<p>Please make sure your computer and Internet connection are good enough to use GOG services and play GOG games and videos.</p>\n<p>4.2 What we can tell you is that using any GOG game will require a computer, equipped with a mouse and keyboard (touchscreen controls are not supported), with an appropriate operating system (please refer to the relevant GOG product page) with all service packs and important updates installed on it.\nAll GOG games should be natively installed on a computer that meets or exceeds the minimum hardware and software specifications shown on the GOG product page.\nGOG games are not tested on virtual machine software and therefore we do not support playing through them.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>4.3 For GOG videos, please make sure your video player supports the videos\u2019 format specified in the GOG product page..</p> &nbsp.\n<p>4.4 If you have questions about system requirements, please contact us here.\nJust so we're clear, you are responsible for making sure you have sufficient Internet access to download purchased GOG games or GOG videos from us or to stream GOG videos and that your system can play GOG games and watch GOG videos.</p> &nbsp.\n5.\nBETAS <p>5.1 As GOG develops, we may offer you optional access to 'beta' versions of GOG software or services (e.g.\nnew versions of the GOG GALAXY Application made available prior to its general release) or GOG content (more on that later)</p>\n<p>Here are the rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) We (or any applicable publisher/partner) will set the conditions and requirements for your beta access.\nProviding and maintaining a beta, and who can use a beta, is at our discretion.</li>\n<li>b) You may be required to go through a registration process or other requirements to access the beta (and this may include you meeting eligibility criteria).</li>\n<li>c) Betas will be time-limited and there may be extra contract requirements.</li>\n<li>d) The beta may involve temporary or permanent server/progress/content wipes, resets or amendments.</li>\n<li>e) The beta may be subject to confidentiality restrictions (which will be notified to you in advance if so).</li>\n<li>f) You may be invited to participate in a feedback process regarding the beta \u2013 this is totally optional but would be really valued.</li>\n<li>g) The beta is for your use and enjoyment, so you must not sell, loan or otherwise transfer it to anyone else.</li>\n<li>h) The point of you getting beta access is to allow you to try something new, but we would expect you to recognise that it will not be complete yet.\nTherefore betas will be provided 'as is' without any additional promises from us or any liability on us if it is not complete or does not work fully or causes issues.\nBetas may not be totally feature-complete and there may be feature changes, modifications or removals during the beta.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may provide access to GOG content in beta/pre-release form.\nFor example, a publisher/partner may decide to release a game or a part of it in beta, or may join our \u2018Games in Development\u2019 program (see section 7.6-7.8.\nbelow).\nAny such GOG content will also be governed by these rules unless the relevant publisher specifies its own rules (which will prevail over these rules).</p>\n<p>We may offer beta access to new releases of GOG software or services.\nBeta versions aren't complete and we're not responsible for what happens while you're using them.\nFear not, they should not blow up your computer!</p> &nbsp.\n6.\nPAYING FOR GOG CONTENT AND GETTING REFUNDS <p>\n<strong>Paying for GOG content</strong>\n</p> &nbsp.\n<p>6.1 Surprise surprise, after you decide that you like a GOG game, GOG video or other GOG content, you usually will need to pay for it before you can access it (though we do have some free content too!).\nYou can pay in different ways: (i) using a valid debit or credit card.\nor (ii) using PayPal or any other authorised payment providers.\nKeep your payment details secure.</p>\n<p>You can use a debit/credit card, PayPal or different local payment methods, to make purchases.\nKeep your payment details secure.</p>\n<p>6.2 When you use a payment method to buy GOG content, we're relying on your promise that you're able to use that method.\nYou are responsible for any purchases made using your GOG account or payment method and you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to them, as notified to you at the time of purchase.\nAll payments are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in this Agreement.\nKids \u2013 your parent or guardian needs to approve any purchase you make.</p>\n<p>You're responsible for your purchases.\nKids \u2013 do not forget to get parental approval first.</p>\n<p>6.3 You can always pay for GOG content in US Dollars.\nHowever if you happen to live in countries where your local currency is supported (see our Support section here for details), you will be able to pay in your local currency.\nYou might have to pay a currency conversion charge if you are not paying in your home currency and some banks might also add other kinds of transaction fees.</p>\n<p>You can pay in US Dollars and, depending on where you live, in your local currency (see opposite)</p>\n<p>6.4.\nAll prices are visible in the product catalogue page.\nThey\u2019re inclusive of legally applicable sales taxes/VAT.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GOG Wallet</strong>\n</p> &nbsp.\n<p>6.5 GOG offers users a digital account balance called the \u201cGOG Wallet\u201d in connection with your user account, which you can use to make purchases of GOG content on dedicated GOG services.\nFunds can be added to it in two ways: (i) using your chosen payment method.\nor (ii) by us as part of our \u2018Voluntary Refund Policy\u2019 (see link here) in which case we may offer refunds to GOG Wallet that you can use to get a replacement GOG game or other GOG content.\nThe GOG Wallet is made available subject to rules which are set out on our GOG Wallet page here.</p>\n<p>We offer you a \u2018GOG Wallet\u2019 which you can use to make purchases.\nIn some cases we can add funds to your GOG Wallet in connection with our Voluntary Refund Policy (see opposite sections).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GOG Bonus Codes</strong>\n</p> &nbsp.\n<p>6.6.\nWe may also issue time-limited bonus codes which give you free or reduced price access to GOG content (we\u2019ll call them \u201cBonus Codes\u201d).\nIf you receive Bonus Codes when you buy GOG content but later decide to return that GOG content, then we think it\u2019s fair for you to return the Bonus Codes too.\nTherefore, we will terminate it or, if it has been redeemed for a GOG game, that game will be removed from your account.</p>\n<p>If you decide to return or exchange GOG content which came with Bonus Codes, we think it\u2019s fair to ask you to give them back too.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Direct to Account Distribution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>6.7 We have a direct to account distribution feature (we\u2019ll call it \u2018GOG Direct to Account) where distribution platforms who partner with us would be able to sell games or other content to you, where you could choose for that game/content to be automatically activated within your GOG account, without the need to redeem any codes.\nJust to be clear, the whole purchase process is handled by the other platform, so in case of any issues with the purchase process please speak with them directly.\nFor this particular matter therefore, we cannot offer you Our Voluntary Refund Policy (because GOG didn\u2019t sell the game/content).\nOf course, anything connected to our platform\u2019s services is still our responsibility.</p>\n<p>Thanks to our GOG Direct to Account feature, we can activate a game/content that you purchase from applicable distribution platforms directly on your GOG account \u2013 cool!</p> 7.\nREFUNDS AND RETURNS <p>\n<strong>Statutory refund rights</strong>\n</p> &nbsp.\n<p>7.1.\nIf you are a resident of the European Union or other applicable jurisdictions (excluding the USA), then you have the statutory right to withdraw from a purchase of GOG content within 14 days of your purchase, without giving a reason.\nHowever, this does not apply where you have expressly consented to the performance of the GOG content (which is digital content) beginning immediately upon conclusion of the purchase process and have acknowledged the loss of your withdrawal rights.</p>\n<p>If you are EU resident, we are obligated to inform you about a statutory withdrawal right, but still our voluntary policy is better.</p>\n<p>7.2.\nNeither this nor any other part of this User Agreement affects your statutory rights.\nIn particular:<br>a) For Australian Users: Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.\nYou are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage.\nYou are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure.\nDetails here<br>b) For New Zealand Users: Neither this nor any other part of this User Agreement excludes, restricts or modifies the application of any right or remedy that cannot be so excluded, restricted or modified including those conferred by the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993.\nUnder this Act are guarantees which include that goods and services are of acceptable quality.\nIf this guarantee is not met there are entitlements to have the software remedied (which may include repair, replacement or refund).\nIf a remedy cannot be provided or the failure is of a substantial character, the act provides for a refund.</p>\n<p>In some jurisdictions, you may have statutory rights with regards to your purchase e.g.\nin Australia or New Zealand (see opposite)</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Voluntary Refund Policy</strong>\n</p> &nbsp.\n<p>7.3.\nWe understand that sometimes a purchase doesn't turn out how you expected and we want to be fair to GOG users.\nThis is why on top of your statutory refund rights (described in section 7.1.-7.2.\nabove) we\u2019re may offering you a Voluntary Refund Policy described here.\nIn some rare cases if we have reasonable doubts regarding your refund request we may not apply the Voluntary Refund Policy.\nIn no case this will deprive you of any applicable statutory refund rights.\nA sale is considered final once your refund rights expire (unless we agree otherwise on a case by case basis).</p>\n<p>We're happy to offer you our assistance according to our Voluntary Refund Policy on top of your statutory refund rights (see details opposite).</p> 8.\nVIRTUAL ITEMS AND VIRTUAL CURRENCY <p>8.1 With certain GOG content you may be able to purchase or acquire virtual items and/or virtual currency (we\u2019ll call them \u201cVirtual Goods\u201d for short).\nVirtual Goods are subject to this Agreement and in particular the following default rules, unless there are specific rules for that GOG content (which will prevail over these rules).</p>\n<p>With some GOG content you can buy virtual items/currency.\nOpposite are the default rules (unless specific rules apply for specific virtual items/currency).</p>\n<p>8.2 Virtual Goods are digital items only with no cash-value or real world existence and cannot be \u2018bought\u2019, \u2018sold\u2019, gifted, transferred or redeemed, whether or not for other Virtual Goods, \u2018real world\u2019 money, goods, services or items of monetary value.\nTrading Virtual Goods is prohibited (unless you are specifically permitted to do so).\nYour right to use any Virtual Goods is limited to a limited, nonexclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable licence to use them solely for your personal entertainment and non-commercial use in the applicable GOG content.\nYou have no property interest or right or title in any Virtual Goods, which remains the appropriate publisher\u2019s property.\nVirtual Goods may be changed, amended or reversed if necessary, including to enforce this Agreement.\nIf necessary, limits may be placed on the use of Virtual Goods (including transaction limits and balance amounts).</p> &nbsp.\n<p>8.3 The existence of a particular offer for Virtual Goods is not a commitment by us to maintain or continue to make the Virtual Goods or that offer available in the future.\nThe scope, variety and type of Virtual Goods that you may obtain can change and we have the right to manage, modify and remove Virtual Goods if we consider necessary for the ongoing operation of GOG or GOG content or for other legitimate reasons, in which case we will have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights.\nWe will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change and to explain the reason for such change.</p> &nbsp.\n9.\nPATCHES, UPDATES AND CHANGES <p>9.1 Occasionally we may need to patch or update GOG services or GOG content (for example to add or remove features or to resolve software bugs).\nWe need these rights in order to keep GOG.COM running efficiently.\nOur Partners may use GOG services to roll out patches or updates for applicable GOG content.</p>\n<p>From time to time we may need to patch or update how GOG services or content work.</p> 10.\nOWNERSHIP OF GOG SERVICES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS <p>10.1 GOG services including (but not limited to) their graphics, computer code, user interface, look and feel, audio, video, text, layout, databases, data and all other content, and all legal and exploitation rights regarding them are either owned by us or we license them from third parties.\nGOG content is owned by its developers/publishers and licensed by us.\nAll rights are reserved except as we have explained in this Agreement.\nYou may not use or exploit any part of the GOG services or GOG content except as explained in this Agreement.</p>\n<p>We spent years building GOG.COM and the GOG services, it\u2019s our little baby.\nIt\u2019s the same for the games/videos and their respective creators/publishers.\nEnjoy it all, but please behave and do not cause trouble.</p>\n<p>10.2.\nGOG respects the intellectual property rights of others.\nPlease read more here.</p> 11.\nRULES FOR USING GOG SERVICES <p>11.1 Please follow these rules regarding the GOG services and GOG content.\nPlease read these rules carefully since failure to follow them (particularly those in relation to cheating) will be considered a material breach of this Agreement, which could lead to suspension or cancellation of your access to GOG services.\nHere are the rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) Only use GOG services or GOG content for your personal enjoyment (for example, don't use them to make money or for political purposes).</li>\n<li>(b) Regarding GOG content, what you can do practically (which includes to modify, merge, distribute, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of it) depends on what the GOG content rights holder allows you to do (GOG can\u2019t grant such rights), so please check this with the rights holder directly (the first thing you should do though is to check if they have a EULA and if so what it says).\nWe also ask that you make only genuine attempts to improve the GOG content.</li>\n<li>(c) Regarding GOG services (which includes GOG software), unless you have prior GOG permission please don\u2019t modify, merge, distribute, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of them \u2013 unless you\u2019re allowed in this Agreement or by the law in your country.\nWe\u2019d like to emphasise that you are free to contact us for permission to do these things and we will review and respond to those requests in good faith.\nMore generally, at some point in the future we want to open client protocols to make it easier for users to work with GOG data/software without any need for reverse engineering or similar techniques.</li>\n<li>(d) Don't hack, harm, grief, interrupt or misuse GOG services or GOG content, GOG users or GOG personnel or use them for any similar purpose.</li>\n<li>(e) Do not create, use, make available and/or distribute cheats, exploits, automation software, robots, bots, mods, hacks, spiders, spyware, cheats, scripts, trainers, extraction tools or other software that interact with or affect GOG services or GOG content in any way (including, without limitation, any unauthorised third party programs that intercept, emulate, or redirect any communication between GOG or its partners and GOG services and/or any unauthorised third party programs that collect information about GOG Services).</li>\n<li>(f) Don't interfere with the GOG or third party network software or other software including via tunnelling, code injection, modifying or changing GOG software, using any other similar software together with GOG services or GOG content, through protocol emulation, or through creation or use of private servers regarding GOG services or GOG content.\nDo not access or attempt to access areas of GOG.COM, GOG GALAXY Application or GOG servers that have not been made available to the public.</li>\n<li>(g) Don't do or say anything which is or may be considered racist, xenophobic, sexist, defamatory or otherwise offensive or illegal.\nBe nice to each other please!</li>\n<li>(h) Don\u2019t share, \u2018buy\u2019, \u2018sell\u2019, transfer, gift, lend, steal, misappropriate or misuse GOG accounts.\nGOG keys/codes can only be gifted or transferred or used in the ways permitted by GOG.\nIf you have any questions or problems, contact customer support.</li>\n<li>(i) We ask you to follow any applicable geographic or regional, language or location-based restrictions, requirements or rules regarding GOG.</li>\n<li>(j) We ask you not to do anything in connection with GOG that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, privacy, publicity, or other right of others, such as images, photographs, sound files, text files, graphics files, and any other material or information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>GOG service and content are here for your personal enjoyment and please use them for this purpose only.\nFor example, don't interfere with or hack GOG services.\nDon't do or say things which are offensive or illegal.</p> 12.\nUSER GENERATED CONTENT <p>12.1 This section is about content (e.g.\ntext, photos or links) which you make available either to us or to other GOG users via GOG services (for example through your profile picture or through messages to other GOG users).\nWe'll call this \"User Generated Content\".</p>\n<p>You own your user generated content used in GOG services.\nPlease make sure it doesn\u2019t breach any third party rights.</p>\n<p>12.2 As far as we and you are concerned, you own any User Generated Content but we need you to give us some limited rights over it so that we can actually transmit it through GOG services.\nSo, we ask you to give us a nonexclusive, irrevocable licence to use, modify, reproduce, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, communicate and publicly display/perform your User Generated Content in connection with GOG services.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>12.3 It is your responsibility to make sure that you have all necessary legal rights before you use User Generated Content and for checking they are safe to use \u2013 we can't know that ourselves, and we can't check it for you, so we have to rely on you.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>12.4.\nHowever, we have the right (but not the obligation) to review and if appropriate or legally necessary to remove any User Generated Content which is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or pornographic.\nIf you find that any such content has been posted on GOG services, please let us know by contacting us at legal@GOG.COM.</p>\n<p>If you find that illegal or inappropriate content has been posted on GOG services, please let us know.</p> 13.\nFEEDBACK OR SUGGESTIONS <p>13.1 You\u2019re welcome to give us feedback and suggestions to improve GOG services and we really value them all.\nHowever, just so we\u2019re clear, we don\u2019t have to use or accept them and we won\u2019t owe you anything (financially or otherwise) regarding them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s cool to send us feedback and suggestions about GOG services, thank you! But please, don\u2019t be disappointed if we don\u2019t use them or reward you for them.</p> 14.\nUSING GOG CONTENT IN FAN WORK <p>14.1 For fan work (e.g.\nworks like fan mods, machinima, parodies, homages, 'Let's Play' or other videos or artwork), you need to check with the content owner (e.g.\nthe developer or publisher) if they are OK with it and if so you should get permission from them.\nThe reason is simple \u2013 the GOG content is the property of the respective owner, not ours.</p>\n<p>If you want to make fan works using GOG content, you will have to find out on your own if that is permitted by the owner and get any necessary legal rights.</p> 15.\nTHIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND EXTERNAL SERVICES <p>15.1 You might get links to third-party websites or content through GOG services which aren\u2019t connected to us.\nUsing them is up to you \u2013 we\u2019re not responsible for them, we can't promise they will work, what they'll be like or if they're free.</p>\n<p>You click on a link on GOG services taking you outside of our little kingdom = we cannot look after you anymore.</p>\n<p>15.2 You can also use your GOG account to get easy access to some external, GOG approved partner services, e.g.\nThe Witcher games and sites from our sister company CD PROJEKT RED.\nThey will have their own terms and conditions which you will need to agree and follow.\nJust to be clear: using these services is all optional and up to you.\nYou have the power!</p>\n<p>You can also use your GOG account to access GOG approved external services, like our sister company CD PROJEKT RED\u2019s cool stuff.\nIt\u2019s totally optional though.</p>\n<p>15.3 A quick word about GOG Connect (which you can read more about here)This (optional) feature is provided subject to Valve\u2019s Steam Web API Terms of Use and therefore access to this feature and how it works may change if necessary to reflect those Terms of Use.\nPlease also see section 11.3 of our Privacy Policy, which explains how we use \u2018Steam Data\u2019 and contains important liability provisions regarding it.\nPlease also see our GOG Connect FAQs which contain further information about GOG Connect and how to use it.</p>\n<p>We offer an optional GOG Connect service (see link opposite).\nCheck out the GOG Connect section of our Privacy Policy too.</p> 16.\nWARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REGARDING GOG SERVICES <p>16.1 We warrant that: (i) we have the right to enter this Agreement and to grant you the licence to use GOG services in section 2.1.\nand (ii) we will take reasonable care with the GOG services and your use of them.\nand (iii) we will use reasonable endeavours to comply with applicable laws in performing our obligations to you under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>We make legally binding

warrant that you have the full power and ability to enter into this Agreement and will follow fully its terms.\nYou also represent and warrant that any User Generated Content, which you transmit via GOG services does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party.\nYou further represent and warrant that you will not use or contribute User Generated Content that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or pornographic.</p>\n<p>16.3.\nWe work hard to try to make GOG content work on your systems but we only have limited time to carry out tests and we don't always get everything right.\nTherefore, we can't accept any liability or responsibility for GOG content except where required by law (see 7.1.-7.2 above).\nWe are also not responsible for anything that happens to GOG.COM or GOG services which is outside of our control.\nHowever, don't forget you may be entitled to GOG content return and refund if it has technical issues see section 7.3 (c).</p> &nbsp.\n17.\nTERMINATION <p>17.1 Your right to terminate the Agreement.\nYou may terminate this Agreement at any time and without giving any reason by completely ceasing to use GOG services.\nIf you would like us to delete your account please contact our Support Team here.\nTermination will not affect already existing rights or obligations of us or you.</p>\n<p>You can terminate this Agreement by just stopping using GOG services for good.</p>\n<p>17.2.\nOur right to terminate the Agreement.\nIf you materially breach this Agreement, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel your access to GOG services and GOG content.\nBy material breach of the Agreement we mean a serious breach which could cause significant harm to GOG, GOG users, as well as, in particular breach of the provisions of section 11 above.\nIf we suspend or cancel your access to GOG services or GOG content we'll take reasonable steps to contact you to explain why we've done this and what (if anything) you can do as a result.</p>\n<p>If you seriously breach this Agreement you may lose access to GOG services (temporarily or permanently).</p>\n<p>17.3 It seems very unlikely, but if we have to stop providing access to GOG services and GOG content permanently (not because of any breach by you), we will try to give you at least sixty (60) days advance notice by posting a note on www.GOG.COM and sending an email to every registered users \u2013 during that time you should be able to download any GOG content you purchased.</p>\n<p>In the very unlikely situation that we have to stop running GOG we'll do our best to give you advance notice, so that you can download and safely store all your DRM-free content.</p> 18.\nFORCE MAJEURE <p>18.1 Neither you nor us will be liable for any failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement or to provide access to GOG services and GOG content if that failure is caused by the happening of any unforeseen event beyond your or our reasonable control including without limitation, Internet outages, communications outages, fire, flood, war or act of God.</p>\n<p>If unforeseen events beyond your or our control occur (war, earthquake, gigantic flood, alien attack, Godzilla, etc.\nok the last two are jokes), then neither of us will be liable to the other for any obligations which can't be performed.</p> 19.\nGOVERNING LAW <p>\n<strong>For users resident in the European Union and elsewhere in the world (but not the USA):</strong>\n</p>
