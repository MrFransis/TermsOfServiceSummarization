</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for using Mailchimp.</p>\n<p>Please read these Terms carefully.\nBy using Mailchimp or signing up for an account, you\u2019re agreeing to these Terms, which will result in a legal agreement between you and Mailchimp (\u201cAgreement\u201d).\nWe\u2019ll start with the basics, including a few definitions that should help you understand these Terms.\nMailchimp (\u201cMailchimp,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is an online marketing platform (the \u201cApp\u201d) that allows you to manage your contacts, and to create, send, and manage certain marketing campaigns, including, without limitation, emails, advertisements, Websites, and mailings (each a \u201cCampaign,\u201d and collectively, \u201cCampaigns\u201d), among other things.\nThe App is offered through our websites, including https://www.mailchimp.com, https://www.tinyletter.com, and https://www.mandrill.com, and any other website or mobile application owned, operated or controlled by us (we\u2019ll collectively refer to these as the \u201cMailchimp Site,\u201d and together with the App, the \u201cService\u201d).\nMailchimp is a Georgia limited liability company whose legal name is The Rocket Science Group LLC d/b/a Mailchimp.\nMailchimp has employees, independent contractors, and representatives (\u201cour Team\u201d).\nAs a customer of the Service or a representative of an entity that\u2019s a customer of the Service, you\u2019re a \u201cMember\u201d according to this Agreement (or \u201cyou\u201d).</p>\n<p>These Standard Terms of Use (\u201cTerms,\u201d including our Acceptable Use Policy, API Use Policy, Copyright and Trademark Policy, Data Processing Addendum, and Brand Guidelines) define the terms and conditions under which you\u2019re allowed to use the Service in accordance with the Agreement, which in addition to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, describe how we\u2019ll treat your account and the data we collect and process about you, your end users, and your contacts while you\u2019re a Member.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to these Terms, you must immediately discontinue your use of the Service.</p>\n<p>Some features of the Service are offered as add-ons to your Mailchimp account (\u201cAdd-ons\u201d).\nUnless expressly stated otherwise, these Terms apply to the use of Add-ons.\nSome Add-ons are intended for particular use cases and may also have additional terms or restrictions (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d).\nAdditional Terms for Add-ons can be found on our Mailchimp Site at mailchimp.com/legal/additional-terms, and Members agree to the applicable Additional Terms at the time they choose to add the corresponding Add-on.\nAlso note that a Member\u2019s account may have access to unique features of the Service based on their historic usage or status.</p>\n<p>Mailchimp uses Google Maps and YouTube to provide certain features of the Service, and, as a result, we are contractually obligated to make our Members aware of certain terms related to the use of such features.\nTherefore, you acknowledge and agree that by signing up for an account and using the Service, you are also bound by the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service and the YouTube Terms of Service (including the Google Privacy Policy).</p>\n<p>If you download the App through the Apple App Store, Google Play or other app store or distribution platform (\u201cApp Provider\u201d), you acknowledge and agree that: (i) these Terms are between us, and not with the App Provider, and that we are responsible for the Service, not the App Provider.\n(ii) the App Provider has no obligation to furnish maintenance and support services or handle any warranty claims.\n(iii) the App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party have relating to the App.\nand (iv) the App Provider is a third party beneficiary of these Terms as related to your use of the App, and the App Provider will have the right to enforce these Terms as related to your use of the App against you.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our Terms, feel free to contact us.</p> Account

process;</li>\n<li>agree to these Terms;</li>\n<li>provide true, complete, and up-to-date contact and billing information.\n</li>\n<li>not be based in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, or any other

U.S.\ngovernment list of prohibited or restricted persons.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet all the requirements listed above, and that you won\u2019t use the Service in a way that violates any laws or regulations.\nNote that by representing and warranting, you are making a legally enforceable promise.</p>\n<p>Mailchimp may refuse service, close accounts of any Members, and change eligibility requirements at any time.</p>\n2.\nTerm\n<p>When you sign up for an account and agree to these Terms, the Agreement between you and Mailchimp is formed, and the term of the Agreement (the \u201cTerm\u201d) will begin.\nThe Term will continue for as long as you have a Mailchimp account or until you or we terminate the Agreement in accordance with these Terms, whichever happens first.\nIf you sign up for an account on behalf of a company or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to accept these Terms and enter into the Agreement on its behalf.</p>\n3.\nClosing Your Account\n<p>You or Mailchimp may terminate the Agreement at any time and for any reason by terminating your Mailchimp account or giving notice to the other party.\nWe may suspend the Service to you at any time, with or without cause.\nIf we terminate your account without cause, and your account is a paid account, we\u2019ll refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment for a Monthly Plan or reimburse you for unused Pay as You Go Credits.\nWe won\u2019t refund or reimburse you in any other situation, including if your account is suspended or terminated for cause, such as for a breach or violation of the Agreement.\nIf your account is inactive for 24 or more months, we may terminate your account and you won\u2019t be entitled to a refund for a prepaid month or reimbursement for unused Pay as You Go Credits.\nOnce your account is terminated, you acknowledge and agree that we may permanently delete your account and all the data associated with it, including your Campaigns.\nUsernames are unique and can only be used once.\nIf your account has been terminated, the username will no longer be available for use on any future accounts and cannot be reclaimed.</p>\n4.\nChanges\n<p>We may change any of the Terms by posting revised Terms on our Mailchimp Site.\nUnless you terminate your account, the new Terms will be effective immediately upon posting and apply to any continued or new use of the Service.\nWe may change the Service, Add-ons, or any features of the Service at any time, and we may discontinue the Service, Add-ons, or any features of the Service at any time.</p>\n5.\nAccount and Password\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for keeping your account name and password confidential.\nYou\u2019re also responsible for any account that you have access to and any activity occurring in such account (other than activity that Mailchimp is directly responsible for that isn\u2019t performed in accordance with your instructions), whether or not you authorized that activity.\nYou\u2019ll immediately notify us of any unauthorized access or use of your accounts.\nWe\u2019re not responsible for any losses due to stolen or hacked passwords.\nWe don\u2019t have access to your current password, and for security reasons, we may only provide you with instructions on how to reset your password.\nWe have the right to update any of your contact information in your account for billing purposes.\nIn addition, you represent and warrant that all information you provide to us when you establish an account, and when you access and use the Service, is and will remain complete and accurate.\nWe may contact you, or any seat, authorized user, or login added to your account, based on the information provided in your account.</p>\n6.\nAccount Disputes\n<p>We don\u2019t know the inner workings of your organization or the nature of your personal relationships.\nYou won\u2019t request access to or information about an account that\u2019s not yours, and you\u2019ll resolve any account-related disputes directly with the other party.\nWe decide who owns an account based on a number of factors, including the content in that account, and the contact and profile information listed for that account.\nIn cases where differing contact and profile information is present or we are unable to reasonably determine ownership, we\u2019ll require you to resolve the matter through proper channels outside of Mailchimp.</p>\n<p>When a dispute is identified, we may suspend any account associated with the dispute, including disabling login and sending capabilities, to protect the security and privacy of the data held within the account until the dispute is properly resolved.</p> Payment 7.\nPaid Monthly Plans and Audience\n<p>\n<strong>If you had a paid Monthly Plan on or before May 15, 2019, the following Section 7 may not apply to you and your account.\nIf it does not apply, an alternate version of Section 7 applicable to you and your account is available in your account (navigate to \u201cAccount,\u201d then \u201cBilling,\u201d then \u201cMonthly plans or credits\u201d).</strong>\n</p>\n7A.\nPaid Monthly Plans\n<p>When you sign up for a paid monthly plan, you are required to self-select both your projected audience, as described in Section 7B below, and your package (e.g., Essentials, Standard, Premium) (together, your \u201cMonthly Plan\u201d) from those posted on our Mailchimp Site based on your anticipated use of the Service.\nEach Monthly Plan offers different pricing and feature options.\nOnce you select your Monthly Plan, Mailchimp will never automatically upgrade or downgrade your Monthly Plan.\nSo, give yourself room to grow if you\u2019ll need it! If you exceed your Monthly Plan usage limits (either by exceeding your audience or monthly email limits, or both), <strong>you will incur additional charges</strong> for the prior billing cycle based on your current Monthly Plan, which will be detailed on your bill and in your account.\nBefore paying for your Monthly Plan for the first time, you will have an opportunity to preview the additional charges which would apply to your Monthly Plan should you incur them by exceeding your self-selected usage limits.\nIf you decide to proceed, and you incur additional charges, you agree to pay them on or before the next Pay Date, as described below.\nYou will always have the option to upgrade to a higher tier at any time.\nIf you upgrade during a billing cycle, you may elect to upgrade your package, your audience limit, or both.\nIf you elect to upgrade both, the upgrade amount for the package upgrade is calculated first, and the upgrade amount for the audience limit upgrade is calculated second.\nIn any event, your monthly charge for that billing cycle will be calculated based on the number of days in that billing cycle during which you were at each of the lower tier and the higher tier (including any applicable additional charges for the higher tier).\nYou will also have the option to downgrade to a lower tier at any time, but if you elect to downgrade during a billing cycle, your downgrade will not be effective until the end of that billing cycle, and you will still be charged for that entire billing cycle at the higher tier (including any applicable additional charges for the higher tier).</p>\n<p>When you sign up for a Monthly Plan, you agree to monthly recurring billing, starting on the date you sign up.\nBilling occurs on the same day each month, based on the date that you started your Monthly Plan.\nPayments are due for any month on the same or closest date to the day you made your first monthly payment (the \u201cPay Date\u201d).\nIf any part of a month is included in the Term, then payment is required for the full month.\nIf you exceed your self-selected usage limits for your Monthly Plan, then you\u2019ll have to pay additional charges (as described above) for the prior billing cycle on or before the next Pay Date, even if the Term ends or you downgrade to a Free Plan before that payment is otherwise due.\nBilling for Monthly Plans may be paused, and you may choose to close your account permanently at any time.</p>\n7B.\nAudience and Archiving\n<p>You may have several types of contacts in your Mailchimp account, but only contacts that you can engage through the Service count as contacts in your \u201caudience\u201d for purposes of your Monthly Plan or Free Plan.\nSubscribed, unsubscribed, and non-subscribed contacts count towards your audience.\nCleaned, reconfirmed, and archived contacts do not count towards your audience, nor do contacts whose opt-in confirmation is pending.\nYou may elect to archive contacts at any time, but any profile changes for an archived contact (whether initiated by you, the contact, or an integration) will automatically unarchive that contact.\nYou cannot engage in any activity through the Service with archived contacts unless and until they are unarchived.\nIf a contact is unarchived, it will immediately count towards your audience for your current billing cycle and any future billing cycles unless and until archived again.</p>\n8.\nFree Plans\n<p>If you use the Service under the free plan (\u201cFree Plan\u201d) and you want to go over the Free Plan limits, you\u2019ll be required to upgrade your account to, and select and pay for, a Monthly Plan.\nMonthly Plans are described in Section 7A above.\nIf you exceed your Free Plan limits, or otherwise upgrade your account to a paid Monthly Plan, you\u2019ll only be provided one complimentary downgrade to the Free Plan (provided your sending volume and audience numbers drop down to the Free Plan limits again).\nIf you go over the limits for the Free Plan more than once, you\u2019ll no longer qualify for the Free Plan, even if your future sending volume and audience numbers are within the limits of the Free Plan.\n</p>\n9.\nPay as You Go Credits\n<p>You may also buy email credits to use the Service (\u201cPay as You Go Credits\u201d), as explained on our Mailchimp Site.\nYou will have an opportunity to review current rates for Pay as You Go Credits in your account prior to purchase.\nIf you choose to buy Pay as You Go Credits, you\u2019ll have access to the features of the Service included in the Essentials package, as described on the pricing page, and other than the monthly payment requirement, all of these Terms will still apply to you.\nPay as You Go Credits purchased on or after May 15, 2019 roll over each month, and expire 12 months after purchase.\nPay as You Go Credits purchased before May 15, 2019 also roll over each month, and expire on May 15, 2020.\nPay as You Go Credits have no cash value, cannot be refunded or redeemed for cash, and represent a limited license to use the Service for the specified volume and type of service.</p>\n10.\nDebit and Credit Cards\n<p>As long as you\u2019re a Member with a Monthly Plan or otherwise have an outstanding balance with us, you\u2019ll provide us with valid debit or credit card (\u201ccard\u201d) information and authorize us to deduct your charges against that card.\nYou\u2019ll replace the information for any card that expires with information for a valid one.\nIf your card is automatically replaced with a new card by a payment processor, you acknowledge and agree that we\u2019re authorized to deduct any charges on your account against the new card.\nAnyone using a card represents and warrants that they are authorized to use that card, and that any and all charges may be billed to that card and won\u2019t be rejected.\nIf we\u2019re unable to process your card order, we\u2019ll try to contact you by email and may suspend your account until your payment can be processed.</p>\n11.\nRefunds\n<p>We\u2019ll give you a refund for a prepaid month or reimburse you for unused Pay as You Go Credits if we stop providing the Service and terminate your account without cause.\nYou won\u2019t be entitled to a refund or credit from us under any other circumstances.\nWe may, at our sole discretion, offer a refund, discount or credit.</p>\n12.\nCharges for Add-Ons\n<p>If you use an Add-on that has a charge, then you\u2019ll be billed that additional amount with each billing cycle for as long as the Add-on is active.\nYour billing cycle for an Add-on may differ from your billing cycle for your Monthly Plan or other features of the Service, and certain Add-ons may require upfront payment for their entire billing cycle.\nIf you use Mandrill to send bulk emails in violation of our Acceptable Use Policy, then we may charge you at the comparable Mailchimp plan or terminate your account.</p>\n13.\nBilling Changes\n<p>We may change our fees, including our charges for Monthly Plans and Pay as You Go Credits, at any time by posting a new pricing structure to our Mailchimp Site or in your account and/or sending you a notification by email.\nQuoted fees don\u2019t include sales or other transaction-based taxes of any kind.</p> Rights 14.\nFeedback and Proprietary Rights\n<p>We own all proprietary rights in the Service, including, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights.\nYou will respect our proprietary rights in the Service, and you may only use our brand assets according to our Brand Guidelines.</p>\n<p>You shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the material, content, data, and information (including your personal information and the personal information of others) you submit to Mailchimp in the course of using the Service or which Mailchimp otherwise retrieves or accesses at your direction or with your permission (collectively, your \u201cContent\u201d).\nSubject to these Terms, you grant us permission to use or disclose your Content (including any personal information therein) only as necessary to provide the Service to you and/or as otherwise permitted by these Terms.\nYou represent and warrant that: (i) you own or have otherwise obtained all necessary rights, releases, and permissions to submit all your Content to the Service and to grant the rights granted to us in these Terms and (ii) your Content and its submission and use as you authorize in these Terms will not violate (1) any applicable law, (2) any third-party intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other rights, or (3) any of your or third-party policies or terms governing your Content.</p>\n<p>You may provide or we may ask you to provide suggestions, comments, input or other feedback (\u201cFeedback\u201d) regarding the Service.\nIf you provide us with any Feedback, then you grant us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, publicly display, distribute, modify, and publicly perform the Feedback as we see fit.\nAny Feedback you choose to provide is given entirely voluntarily.\nYou understand that you will not receive any compensation for your Feedback, and that we may use any Feedback you provide to improve the Service or to develop new features and services.</p>\n15.\nPrivacy Policy\n<p>Your privacy is important to us.\nPlease read our Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement for information regarding how we collect, use, and disclose your personal information and the privacy rights available to you when you use and interact with the Service.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of

Policy, where we process personal information, including Content and other data from Member accounts, as a controller for important business purposes (e.g., for billing, administrative, security, and product improvement purposes).</p>\n<p>When we, as a controller, process data that originates from the European Economic Area, UK, or Switzerland in a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection law, we shall process such data in compliance with the European Commission decision C(2004) 5271 standard contractual clauses for controllers (as updated, amended, or replaced from time to time), the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.\nFor the purposes of the descriptions in the standard contractual clauses:

sensitive data: n/a.\nand (iii) contact points for data protection enquiries are as set forth in these Terms.</p>\n16.\nRight to Review Content and Campaigns\n<p>We may view, copy, and internally distribute Content from your Campaigns and account to create algorithms and programs (\u201cTools\u201d) that help us spot problem accounts and improve the Service.\nWe use these Tools to find Members who violate these Terms or laws and to study data internally to make the Service smarter and create better experiences for Members and their contacts.\nWe may aggregate and anonymize data, including from the Content of your Campaigns, to create statistical information.\nAggregated anonymized statistical information may be shared externally for research, marketing, or other lawful purposes.</p>

you can respond to the request accordingly.</p>\n<p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any losses, including all legal fees and expenses, that result from your breach of this Section 20.</p>\n21.\nExport Controls\n<p>The software that supports the App (the \u201cSoftware\u201d) is subject to U.S.\nExport Control Laws and Regulations.\nExport laws are set up by the U.S.\ngovernment to keep certain goods and services from reaching other countries, usually because of security concerns or trade agreements.\nNone of the Software may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S.\nExport Control Laws and Regulations and any other applicable export laws and regulations (collectively, \u201cExport Control Laws\u201d).\nTherefore, you agree that you won\u2019t, directly or indirectly through a third party, allow the Software or your Campaigns to be accessed or generated from within, or distributed or sent to, any prohibited or embargoed country as mentioned in any Export Control Laws.\nIn addition, you certify that neither you nor any principals, officers, directors, or any person or entity you know to be directly involved with the use of the Service is designated on any U.S.\ngovernment list of prohibited or restricted persons.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that this Section 21 isn\u2019t meant to provide a comprehensive summary of the Export Control Laws that govern Mailchimp, the Service, or the Software.\nYou\u2019re downloading and using the Software at your own risk, and it\u2019s your responsibility to consult with a legal advisor to make sure your use of the Service and the Software complies with applicable laws.</p> Liability 22.\nLimitation of Liability\n<p>\n<strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that (i) you assume full responsibility for any loss that results from your use of the Service, including any downloads from the Mailchimp Site.\n(ii) we and our Team won\u2019t be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, or consequential damages under any circumstances, even if they\u2019re based on negligence or we\u2019ve been advised of the possibility of those damages.\nand (iii) in any calendar month, our total liability to you arising under or in connection with the Agreement\u2014whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise\u2014will be no more than what you paid us for the Service the preceding month.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For the avoidance of doubt, in no instance will we or our Team be liable for

http://www.tinyletter.com, and http://www.mandrill.com, or any website or mobile application owned, operated or controlled by us (collectively, \u201cMailchimp Sites\u201d or \u201cMailchimp Site\u201d), and when our Members\u2019 end users visit websites or e-commerce stores operated by our Members or open or interact with emails delivered through our Service.\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.\nThis Cookie Statement is and will be treated as part of our Terms of Use, and is automatically incorporated therein.\nCapitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Cookie Statement have the meanings given to those terms in our Privacy Policy or Additional Terms.</p>\n<p>In some cases we may use cookies and other tracking technologies described in this Cookie Statement to collect Personal Information, or to collect information that becomes Personal Information if we combine it with other information.\nFor more information about how we process your Personal Information, please consult our Privacy Policy.</p> What are cookies? <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.\nCookies are widely used by online service providers in order to (for example) make their websites or services work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website owner or service provider (in this case, Mailchimp) are called \u201cfirst-party cookies\u201d.\nCookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d.\nThird-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website or service you are using (such as advertising, interactive content and analytics).\nThe third parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website or service in question and also when it visits certain other websites or services.</p> Why do we use cookies and other tracking technologies? <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Mailchimp Sites and Service to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies.\nOther cookies enable us and the third parties we work with to track and target the interests of Visitors to our Mailchimp Sites, and we refer to these as \u201cperformance\u201d or \u201cfunctionality\u201d cookies.\nFor example, we use cookies to tailor content and information that we may send or display to you and otherwise personalize your experience while interacting with our Mailchimp Sites and to otherwise improve the functionality of the Service we provide.\nWe also enable our Members to employ cookies and similar tracking technologies in connection with their use of our Service in order to allow us and our Members to track their Contacts or end users.\nFinally, third parties serve cookies through our Mailchimp Sites and Service for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.\nThis is described in more detail below.</p> Cookies served through our Mailchimp Sites <p>The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Mailchimp Sites and the purposes they perform

Other tracking technologies\n<p>We and our third-party partners may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons, SDKs, pixels (or \u201cclear gifs\u201d) and other tracking technologies.\nPixels are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Mailchimp Sites or, in the case of web beacons, opened an email that we have sent them.\nThis allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of Visitors from one page within our Mailchimp Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Mailchimp Sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to serve targeted advertisements to you and others like you, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of marketing campaigns.\nWhile you may not have the ability to specifically reject or disable these tracking technologies, in many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly.\naccordingly, in those instances, declining cookies will impair the functionality of these technologies.</p> Targeted online advertising <p>We have engaged one or more third-party service providers to track and analyze both individualized usage and volume statistical information from interactions with our Mailchimp Sites.\nWe also partner with one or more third parties (such as advertisers and ad networks) to display advertising on our Mailchimp Sites and/or to manage and serve advertising on other sites.</p>\n<p>These third parties use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Mailchimp Sites and/or other sites or mobile apps, to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests (\u201cInterest Based Advertising\u201d).\nFor more information about this practice, click here: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.</p>\n<p>Our third-party service providers may also use cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Mailchimp Sites and/or other sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our ads).\nThe information collected by these third parties does not include personal information that enables you to be specifically identified (e.g.\nby reference to your name or email address).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Facebook:</strong> We also use the pixel function of Facebook Custom Audiences to identify users who have landed on certain pages for the purposes of target group-orientated remarketing and advertising.\nThe Facebook pixel stores a cookie, which means that information about your visit to our Mailchimp Site will be shared with Facebook.\nAlso, as part of the \"advanced matching\" undertaken by Facebook, other personal information (such as telephone number, email address, Facebook ID) may be shared with Facebook in a protected (hashed) form.\nThese cookies and the information collected are used to create target groups to help Facebook deliver advertising on our behalf to users who have previously visited our Mailchimp Site when they are on Facebook or a digital platform powered by Facebook Advertising, and to track advertising success.\nYou can modify your Facebook Ad settings to restrict these advertisements.\nNavigate to Settings/Adverts in your Facebook account to adjust your preferences.\nLearn more about the different types of Facebook cookies here: https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/</p> Cookies served through the Service Member email campaigns\n<p>We automatically place single pixel gifs, also known as web beacons, in every email sent by our Members.\nThese are tiny graphic files that contain unique identifiers that enable us and our Members to recognize when their Contacts have opened an email or clicked certain links.\nThese technologies record each Contact\u2019s email address, IP address, date, and time associated with each open and click for a campaign.\nWe use this data to create reports for our Members about how an email campaign performed and what actions Contacts took.</p>\nMember sites\n<p>If a Member elects to use certain Mailchimp add-ons or features, the use of those may permit or require additional cookies or tracking technologies to be employed.\nIf a Member connects his or her website or e-commerce store (in each case, a \u201cSite\u201d) to a Mailchimp account, Mailchimp installs a JavaScript tracking snippet (\u201cSnippet\u201d) on that Member\u2019s Site.\nThis Snippet will allow cookies, pixels, and other technologies to be set on that Member\u2019s Site to facilitate the use of certain automations, features and functionality offered by Mailchimp through the Service.\nThe specific cookies, pixels, or other technologies that will be set on a Member\u2019s Site depend on the particular add-ons or features that the Member chooses to use as part of the Service.\nEnd users should therefore review the relevant Member\u2019s privacy notice and cookie disclosures for further information about the specific types of cookies and other tracking technologies used on the Site.\nThese optional add-ons and features include:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Google remarketing ads</strong>: Our Google remarketing ads feature (also known as web retargeting ads) allows our Members to create and manage advertisements on the Google Display Network.\nWhen a Member elects to use this feature, Mailchimp installs a Google tracking pixel on that Member\u2019s Site through the Snippet.\nThe Snippet also allows that Member\u2019s Site to set a Mailchimp cookie that will recognize Site end users via ads placed with the Google remarketing ads feature.\nThese technologies facilitate the placement of advertising campaigns on the Google Display Network and enable Mailchimp to provide reporting to our Members about the performance of these advertising campaigns.\nTo refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading \u201cHow can I control cookies?\u201d Alternatively, please click on the relevant opt-out link here:https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Facebook ads (including Facebook remarketing ads)</strong>: Our Facebook ads feature allows our Members to display ads to their end users and others within the Facebook platform.\nWhen a Member elects to use this feature, Mailchimp installs a Facebook tracking pixel on that Member\u2019s Site through the Snippet.\nThe Snippet may also allow that Member\u2019s Site to set a Mailchimp cookie that will recognize Site end users via ads placed with the Facebook ads feature.\nThese tracking technologies facilitate the placement of advertising campaigns on the Facebook platform and enable Mailchimp to provide reporting to our Members about the performance of these advertising campaigns.\nFacebook does not provide an opt-out link for its cookies.\nFor more information about Facebook cookies, please click here: https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/.\nTo refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading \u201cHow can I control cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Product retargeting emails</strong>: Our product retargeting emails feature allows our Members to promote new items or best sellers to their end users.\nWhen an end user clicks a link within a product retargeting email, the Member\u2019s Site drops a Mailchimp cookie on that end user\u2019s device that is placed through the Snippet.\nThis cookie allows Mailchimp to track attribution rates and browser activity and provide reporting to the Member regarding the success of their product retargeting emails.\nTo refuse this cookie, please follow the instructions below under the heading \u201cHow can I control cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Popup forms</strong>: The Snippet will allow a Member\u2019s Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie that recognizes whether an end user to that Member\u2019s Site has previously viewed a popup form and ensures the same end user does not see the form again for a period of up to one year.\nTo refuse this cookie, please follow the instructions below under the heading \u201cHow can I control cookies?\u201d</p>\nLanding Pages and Websites\n<p>If a Member elects to use the Mailchimp features known as \u201cLanding Pages\u201d or \u201cWebsites,\u201d the use of either feature will permit cookies and tracking technologies to be deployed by the Member.\nIf a Member elects to build a Landing Page or Website, a javascript tag, also known as a JS tag, will be placed on their page.\nThis tag allows our Members to see the aggregate number of visitors to their Website or Landing Page.\nIn addition, the Member will see the aggregate number of clicks on any links included in their Website or Landing Page.\nWe provide this data to our Members in order to demonstrate how their Website or Landing Page has performed.</p>\n<p>Members who create Landing Pages or Websites will have the option to set cookies on the device of any end user to those pages.\nWhen a Member chooses to set cookies, Mailchimp installs the Snippet on that Member\u2019s Landing Page or Website to facilitate the deployment of the cookie(s) selected by that Member.\nThe specific cookies, pixels, or other technologies that will be set on a Member\u2019s Landing Page or Website depend on the particular add-ons or features that the Member chooses to use as part of the Service.\nEnd users should review the relevant Member\u2019s privacy notice and cookie disclosures for further information about the specific types of cookies and other tracking technologies used on any Landing Page or Website.\nThese optional add-ons and features include:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Track with Mailchimp:</strong> Our Track with Mailchimp feature allows Members to track unique visits by deploying cookies on a Member\u2019s Landing Page or Website.\nTrack with Mailchimp calculates the conversion rate by comparing the number of unique visits to the number of end users who subscribe.\nOn Websites, Track with Mailchimp allows Members to track page view events and link click data of their Contacts by retrieving page views and link clicks from a Contact\u2019s local storage</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Facebook Pixel:</strong> Our Facebook Pixel feature allows our Members to track page views and create more targeting Facebook ads.\nWhen a Member elects to use this feature, Mailchimp installs a Facebook tracking pixel on that Member\u2019s Landing Page or Website through the Snippet.\nThe Snippet may also allow that Member\u2019s Landing Page or Website to set a Mailchimp cookie that will recognize end users on Facebook via the Facebook ads feature.\nThese tracking technologies facilitate the placement of advertising campaigns on the Facebook platform and enable Mailchimp to provide reporting to our Members about the performance of these advertising campaigns.\nFacebook does not provide an opt-out link for its cookies.\nFor more information about Facebook cookies, please click here: https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/.\nTo refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading \u201cHow can I control cookies?\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Google Analytics:</strong> Our Google Analytics feature allows our Members to connect their Google Analytics Account to better understand their end users.\nWhen a Member elects to use this feature, Mailchimp installs a Google tracking pixel on that Member\u2019s Site through the Snippet.\n</p> How can I control cookies? <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject

For Websites </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain features within Mailchimp are offered as add-ons to your Mailchimp account.\nSome add-ons have additional terms or restrictions (\u201cAdditional Terms\u201d) associated with them.\nAdditional Terms for each of the add-ons can be found below, and Mailchimp Members agree to the applicable Additional Terms at the time they choose to add the corresponding add-on feature.</p> For Connected Sites <p>These Additional Terms apply to any Mailchimp account that has a website or store (\u201cConnected Site\u201d or \u201cSite\u201d) connected to their Mailchimp account.</p>\n<p>Please read these Additional Terms carefully before adding, connecting, or re-authorizing a Connected Site.\nBy clicking \u201cAccept\u201d within the Mailchimp application and continuing to connect your Site to Mailchimp you are agreeing to these Additional Terms.</p>\n<p>When you connect your Site with Mailchimp, you agree that Mailchimp may automatically install a JavaScript tracking snippet on your Site at the time of connection and/or re-authorization.\nThis snippet is necessary to enable several of Mailchimp\u2019s powerful e-commerce automations and advertising features.\nSome of these automations and features work by allowing you to track the activity of your subscribed contacts\u2019 on your Site through the use of cookies or similar technologies, such as pixels.\nThe JavaScript snippet will allow cookies, pixels, and other technologies to be set by your Connected Site, giving you full access to the automations, features, and functionality offered by Mailchimp.\nThe specific cookies, pixels, or other technologies that will be set on your Site will depend on the particular automations and features within Mailchimp that you choose to use.\nThe following automations and features are enabled by the Javascript snippet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Product Retargeting Emails: the Javascript snippet will allow your Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie on a subscriber\u2019s device when the subscriber clicks a link within a product retargeting email.\nThis cookie tracks attribution rates and browser activity, allowing Mailchimp to provide you with reporting on the success of your product retargeting emails.</li>\n<li>Google Remarketing Ads: the Javascript snippet will install a Google tracking pixel on your Site and will allow your Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie that recognizes visitors to your Site from the remarketing ads you place.\nThese technologies facilitate remarketing ad placement and reporting on the performance of your advertising campaigns.\nFurther information can be found in the Additional Terms of Use for Google Ads Through Mailchimp, which must be agreed to before placing a Google remarketing ad.</li>\n<li>Facebook Remarketing Ads: the Javascript snippet will install a Facebook pixel on your Site.\nThese technologies facilitate remarketing ad placement and reporting on the performance of your advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram.\nFurther information can be found in the Additional Terms of Use for Facebook and Instagram Ad Buying Through Mailchimp, which must be agreed to before placing a Facebook remarketing ad.</li>\n<li>Popup Forms: the Javascript snippet will allow your Site to deploy a Mailchimp cookie that recognizes whether a visitor to your Site has previously viewed your popup form and ensures the same visitor does not see your form again for a period of up to one year.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is your responsibility to understand how your use of the available e-commerce automations and features will impact your Connected Site, including whether a particular e-commerce automation or feature will cause your Connected Site to deploy any tracking technologies.\nYou can visit Mailchimp\u2019s Cookie Statement at any time for a description of the cookies and tracking technologies that can be employed by a Mailchimp user through the use of Mailchimp (see the Section entitled \u201cCookies served through the Services\u201d).</p>\n<p>If you choose to enable automations or features that rely on the JavaScript snippet once your Site is connected, you represent and warrant that (1) you have permission from your subscribed contacts to track activity via cookies, pixels, and other similar technologies, and to transfer information related to this tracking to Mailchimp, and (2) your Site adequately discloses your tracking practices and use of cookies, pixels, and similar technologies in a Privacy Policy, Cookie Statement, or other disclosure.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, you also understand and agree:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Mailchimp may modify, change, or discontinue the ability to integrate Connected Sites with your Mailchimp account at any time.</li>\n<li>Mailchimp may refuse service or limit, suspend, or terminate your use of Connected Sites integrations at any time, with or without cause.</li>\n<li>You may discontinue your use of Connected Site integrations at any time by disconnecting your Site from your Mailchimp account and removing the Mailchimp integration from your Site or e-commerce platform.\nWhen you disconnect your Site from your Mailchimp account, any information obtained by the cookies, pixels, or similar technologies set by the Javascript tracking snippet on your Site will no longer be received by Mailchimp.</li>\n<li>Mailchimp may modify or change these Additional Terms from time-to-time.\nWhen we change these Additional Terms, we will post the revised Additional Terms here (www.mailchimp.com/legal/additional-terms).\nFor this reason, you should review these Additional Terms often.\nAny changes will be effective immediately and will apply to your continued use of Connected Site integrations with your Mailchimp account.</li>\n<li>To continue enabling the automations and features that you have chosen to turn on, Mailchimp may need to modify or change the code within the JavaScript snippet installed on your Site in the future.\nThese modifications or changes may cause your Site to deploy additional tracking technologies, or result in the deletion of cookies, pixels, or similar technologies being set by your Site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have a Shopify Connected Site, you further understand and agree:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As between Shopify and Mailchimp only, Mailchimp is solely responsible for the Service offered by Mailchimp (as defined in our Standard Terms of Use), and Shopify is not liable for any fault in the Service or any harm that may result

of Mailchimp.\nYou understand and agree that Mailchimp is an independent party and has no right, responsibility, or ability to control, direct, or influence any action, inaction, conduct, or decision made by Facebook or Instagram.</li>\n</ol>\nPart B: Advertising Review and Compliance\n<p>Your use of the Ad Buying Feature, including the content of any ads you might create, is subject to review by both Facebook and Mailchimp and you agree to comply with the terms and policies of both companies.</p>\n<p>If you do not comply with both Facebook\u2019s Terms (including the Facebook Advertising Policies) and Mailchimp\u2019s Terms, any of the following actions may be taken: (1) your ad might be rejected by Facebook or Mailchimp.\n(2) we might, in our sole discretion, revoke your ability to use the Ad Buying Feature.\nand/or (3) we might suspend or terminate your Mailchimp account.</p>\n<p>To use the Ad Buying Feature to create and place remarketing ads on Facebook or Instagram, your website or store must be connected to your Mailchimp account (\u201cSite\u201d), or you must create a landing page in your Mailchimp account (\u201cLanding Page\u201d).\nWhen you elect to enable the Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page or create your first Facebook ad that links to your Site or Landing Page, a Javascript snippet deployed on your Site or Landing Page will install a Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page.\nThese tracking technologies facilitate the placement of your advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram and enable Mailchimp to provide reporting to you about the performance of your advertising campaigns.\nYou represent and warrant that your Site or Landing Page adequately discloses the use of tracking technologies, such as cookies and pixels, used by your Site or Landing Page in a Privacy Policy, Cookie Statement, or other disclosure and informs visitors to your Site or Landing Page that information collected by these technologies may be transferred to Mailchimp and Facebook.\nBy using the Ad Buying Feature, you are giving Mailchimp permission to install the Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page on your behalf.</p>\nPart C: Transfer of Data to Facebook\n<p>Certain options within the Ad Buying Feature, such as the custom audience option, allow you to pass data to Facebook.\nThe data that may be transferred through use of the custom audience option consists of hashed values of email addresses.\nOnly those emails addresses you expressly select will be hashed and passed to Facebook.\nIf you elect to enable the Facebook pixel on your Site or Landing Page to enable Facebook remarketing ads, the Facebook pixel will enable Facebook to collect data on visitors to your Site or Landing Page for purposes of creating a custom audience (without transferring hashed values of email addresses) and serving the remarketing ads.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to pass data to Facebook, you represent and warrant that you have the right to use the data in such a manner and that you have secured permission from any individuals whose data will be hashed to transfer the data to Facebook.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that you are the party transferring data to Facebook and that such data is being passed directly from you to Facebook.</p>\nPart D: Payment Terms\n<p>The Ad Buying Feature is an add-on to your Mailchimp account and will be billed as such (please see Section 12 of our Standard Terms of Use for more information regarding add-ons).\nWhen creating an advertising campaign through the Ad Buying Feature, you will be asked to select a maximum budget for your advertising campaign.\nYou agree to pay the amount chosen as your maximum budget up front, and your credit card will be charged for this amount in its entirety.\nAds will then be placed by Facebook on your behalf according to the criteria you select using the Ad Buying Feature until your maximum budget is reached.\nIn certain circumstances, however, your entire budget may not be exhausted.\nAny unused portion of your budget will be credited to your account as an \u201cAd Credit\u201d and may be used toward the purchase of future advertising campaigns with the Ad Buying Feature.\nAd Credits may not be used to purchase or pay for email campaigns or other Mailchimp add-ons or services, and are only valid for the purchase of services available through the Ad Buying Feature.\nAd Credits do not expire.</p>\n<p>If you violate these Additional Terms, Mailchimp\u2019s Standard Terms of Use, or the Facebook Advertising Policies you will not receive a refund for any purchases you made through the Ad Buying Feature.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Updated May 30, 2019</em>\n</p>\nFacebook Custom Audience Terms\n<p>Facebook\u2019s custom audiences feature enables you to create an audience using your data such as email addresses and phone numbers.\nWhen using Facebook\u2019s custom audiences feature, your data is locally hashed on your system before you upload and pass such data to Facebook to be used to create your custom audience (the \u201cHashed Data\u201d).\nWithout limiting any agreement between you and Facebook, by clicking \u201cI accept,\u201d passing to Facebook the Hashed Data, or using custom audiences for advertising, you agree to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You represent and warrant, without limiting anything in these terms, that you have all necessary rights and permissions and a lawful basis to disclose and use the Hashed Data in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry guidelines.\nIf you are using a Facebook identifier to create a custom audience, you must have obtained the identifier directly from the data subject in compliance with these terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are providing Hashed Data on behalf of an advertiser, you represent and warrant that you have the authority as agent to the advertiser to disclose and use such data on their behalf and will bind the advertiser to these

to honoring or provided to opt out of having that data disclosed and used for targeted advertising.\nTo the extent an individual exercises such an opt-out after you have used data relating to that individual to create a custom audience, you will remove that data subject from the custom audience.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You instruct Facebook to use the Hashed Data for the matching process.\nFacebook will not share the Hashed Data with third parties or other advertisers and will delete the Hashed Data promptly after the match process is complete.\nFacebook will maintain the confidentiality and security of the Hashed Data and the collection of Facebook User IDs that comprise the custom audience(s) created from your Hashed Data (\u201cyour custom audience(s)\u201d), including by maintaining technical and physical safeguards that are designed to (a) protect the security and integrity of data while it is within Facebook's systems and (b) guard against the accidental or unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of data within Facebook's systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Facebook will not give access to or information about the custom audience(s) to third parties or other advertisers, use your custom audience(s) to append to the information we have about our users or build interest-based profiles, or use your custom audience(s) except to provide services to you, unless we have your permission or are required to do so by law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Facebook may modify, suspend or terminate access to, or discontinue the availability of, the custom audiences feature at any time.\nYou may discontinue your use of the custom audiences feature at any time.\nYou may delete your custom audience(s) from the Facebook system at any time through your account tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may not use the custom audiences feature unless you are an advertiser (or an agency acting on behalf of an advertiser), Ads API or Custom Audiences API partner, a data partner uploading an audience on behalf of that advertiser, or have obtained express, written permission from Facebook.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may not sell or transfer your custom audiences, or authorize any third party to sell or transfer custom audiences.\nIf you have entered into an independent agreement with a partner for licensing marketing information, you may use the custom audiences tools and sharing functionality to create and provide custom audiences for advertising based on that information, subject to the requirements of these terms and applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A note to EU and Swiss data controllers: To the extent the Hashed Data contains personal data relating to an individual who resides in the European Union or Switzerland, the parties acknowledge and agree that for purposes of creating the custom audiences, as described above, that you are the data controller in respect of such personal data, and you have instructed Facebook Ireland Limited to process such personal data on your behalf as your data processor pursuant to these terms and Facebook\u2019s Data Processing Terms, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that Facebook, Inc.\nmay act as a sub-processor for and on behalf of Facebook Ireland Limited for the purpose of fulfilling Facebook Ireland Limited\u2019s obligations under these Custom Audiences Terms.\n\u201cPersonal data,\u201d \u201cdata controller,\u201d and \u201cdata processor\u201d in this paragraph have the meanings set out in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These Custom Audiences Terms and, to the extent applicable, the Data Processing Terms, govern the provision by you of Hashed Data to us and your use of the custom audiences feature, and your use of custom audiences for advertising.\nThey do not replace any terms applicable to your purchase of advertising inventory from Facebook (including but not limited to the Facebook Advertising Policies at https://www.facebook.com/policies/ads), and such terms will continue to apply to your ad campaigns targeted to your custom audience.\nThe custom audiences feature is a Facebook Product under Facebook\u2019s Terms of Service (https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms, the \u201cTerms\u201d).\nIn the event of any express conflict between these Custom Audiences Terms and the Terms, these Custom Audiences Terms will govern solely with respect to your use of the custom audiences feature and solely to the extent of the conflict.\nFacebook reserves the right to monitor or audit your compliance with these terms and to update these terms from time to time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Effective Date: May 25, 2018</em>\n</p> For

first billing month will be prorated based on the number of days remaining in your billing cycle.\n</li>\n<li>If you choose to disable your Transactional Email Add-on then: (A) you will immediately

context of your interactions with Mailchimp, your Mailchimp account settings, the products and features you use, your location, and applicable law.\nHowever, the Personal Information we collect broadly falls into the following categories:</p>\n<p>(i) <strong>Information you provide to us</strong>: You (or your organization) may provide certain Personal Information to us when you sign up for a Mailchimp account and use the Service, consult with our customer service team, send us an email, integrate the Service with another website or service (for example, when you choose to connect your e-commerce account with Mailchimp), or communicate with us in any other way.</p>\n<p>This information may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business contact information (such as your name, job title, organization, location, phone number, email address, and country);</li>\n<li>Marketing information (such as your contact preferences);</li>\n<li>Account log-in credentials (such as your email address

Data\u201d).\nIn some (but not all) countries, including countries in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), this information is considered Personal Information under applicable data protection laws.\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect some of this information.\nIf you are using our Mobile App, we may collect this information using our software development kits (\u201cSDKs\u201d) or APIs the first time the SDK or API is initiated on your Mobile App.\nFor further information, please review the section below and our Cookie Statement available here.</p>\n<p>Service Usage Data may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device information:</strong> We collect information about the device and applications you use to access the Service, such as

information about the features of our Mobile App that you accessed.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Log data:</strong> Our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers and the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses and your activity in the Service (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take (for example, which features you used)), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called \u2018crash dumps\u2019)), and hardware

whenever you interact with our Service, which may include the dates and times you access the Service and your browsing activities (such as what portions of the Service you used).\nWe also collect

such as public databases, social media platforms, third-party data providers, and our joint marketing partners.\n</p>\n<p>Examples of the information we receive from other sources include demographic information (such as age and gender), device information (such as IP addresses), location (such as city and state), and online behavioral data (such as information about your use of social media websites, page view information and search results and links).\nWe use this information, alone or in combination with other Personal Information we collect, to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing and content to you and to develop and provide you with more relevant products, features, and service.</p>\nB.\nUse of Personal Information\n<p>We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive through the Service (alone or in combination with other data we source) for the purposes and on the legal bases identified below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To bill and collect money owed to us by you to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into a contract with you, in accordance with our legitimate interests to operate and administer our Service.\nThis includes sending you emails, invoices, receipts, notices of delinquency, and alerting you if we need a different credit card number.\nWe use third parties for secure credit card transaction processing, and those third parties collect billing information to process your orders and credit card payments.\nTo learn more about the steps we take to safeguard that data, see the \"Our Security\" section of this privacy policy.</li>\n<li>To send you system alert messages in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering the Service and providing certain features.\nFor example, we may inform you about temporary or permanent changes to our Service, such as planned outages, or send you account, security or compliance notifications, such as new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to this privacy policy.</li>\n<li>To communicate with you about your account and provide customer support to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into a contract with you, in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering and supporting our Service.\nFor example, if you use our Mobile Apps, we may ask you if you want to receive push notifications about activity in your account.\nIf you have opted in to these push notifications and no longer want to receive them, you may turn them off through your operating system.</li>\n<li>To enforce compliance with our Standard Terms of Use and applicable law, and to protect the rights and safety of our Members in reliance on our legitimate interest to protect against misuse or abuse of our Service and to pursue remedies available.\nThis may include developing tools and algorithms that help us prevent violations.\nFor example, sometimes we review the content our Members send or display to ensure it complies with our Standard Terms of Use.\nTo improve that process, we have software that helps us find content that may violate our Standard Terms of Use.\nWe may or our third-party service provider may also review content that our Members send or display.\nThis benefits all Members who comply with our Standard Terms of Use because it reduces abuse and helps us maintain a reliable platform.\nPlease do not use Mailchimp to send or display confidential information.</li>\n<li>To meet legal requirements, including complying with court orders, valid discovery requests, valid subpoenas, and other appropriate legal mechanisms.</li>\n<li>To provide information to representatives and advisors, including attorneys and accountants, to help us comply with legal, accounting, or security requirements in reliance on our legitimate interests.</li>\n<li>To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration, or similar legal proceeding.</li>\n<li>To respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>\n<li>To provide, support and improve the Service to perform our contract with you for the use of the Service or where we have not entered into a contract with you, in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering and improving the Service and providing certain features.\nFor example, this may include sharing your information with third parties in order to provide and support our Service or to make certain features of the Service available to you.\nWhen we share your Personal Information with third parties, we take steps to protect your information in a manner that is consistent with our obligations under applicable privacy laws.\nFor further information about how we share your information, refer to Section 5 below.\n</li>\n<li>To provide suggestions to you and to provide tailored features within our Service that optimize and personalize your experience in reliance on our legitimate interests in administering the Service and providing certain features.\nThis includes adding features that compare Members\u2019 email campaigns, using data to suggest other publishers your Contacts may be interested in, or using data to recommend products or services that you may be interested in or that may be relevant to you or your Contacts.\nSome of these suggestions are generated through analysis of the data used in our data analytics projects, as described below.</li>\n<li>To perform data analytics projects in reliance on our legitimate business interests in improving and enhancing our products and services for our Members.\nOur data analytics projects use data from Mailchimp accounts, including Personal Information of Contacts, to provide and improve the Service.\nWe use information like your sending habits and your Contacts\u2019 purchase history, so we can make more informed predictions, decisions, and products for our Members.\nFor example, we use data from Mailchimp accounts to enable product recommendation, audience segmentation, and predicted demographics features for our Members.\nIf you or your Contact prefers not to have their data used for this purpose, you can alter the settings on your account (as described here) to opt out of data analytics projects, or your Contact can opt out of data analytics projects at any time by visiting this page or emailing us at personaldatarequests@mailchimp.com.\nAs always, we take the privacy of Personal Information seriously, and will continue to implement appropriate safeguards to protect this Personal Information from misuse or unauthorized disclosure.</li>\n<li>To combine and anonymize data about our Members and our Member's use of the Service in order to create aggregate, anonymized statistics which we may use to provide certain features within the Service and for promoting and improving the Service in reliance on our legitimate interests.</li>\n<li>To personalize the Service, content and advertisements we serve to you in reliance on our legitimate interests in supporting our marketing activities and providing certain features within the Service.\nWe may use your Personal Information to serve you specifically, such as to deliver marketing information, product recommendations and non-transactional communications (e.g., email, telemarketing calls, SMS, or push notifications) about us, in accordance with your marketing preferences and this privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>\nC.\nThird-Party Integrations\n<p>We may use the Personal Information we collect or receive through the Service, as a processor and as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, to enable your use of the integrations and plugins you choose to connect to your Mailchimp account.\nFor instance, if you choose to connect a Google integration to your Mailchimp account, we\u2019ll ask you to grant us permission to view and/or download, as applicable, your Google Sheets, Google Contacts, Google Analytics and Google Drive.\nThis allows us to configure your Google integration(s) in accordance with your preferences.\nFor example, if you wanted to use the Google Contacts integration to share the templates in your Mailchimp account with contacts in your Google address book, we would need to access your Google Contacts to share your templates.\n</p>\nD.\nCookies and Tracking Technologies\n<p>We and our third-party partners may use various technologies to collect and store Service Usage Data when you use our Service (as discussed above), and this may include using cookies and similar tracking technologies, such as pixels, web beacons, and if you use our Mobile Apps, through our SDKs deployed on your mobile device.\nFor example, we use web beacons in the emails we send on your behalf, which enable us to track certain behavior, such as whether the email sent through the Service was delivered and opened and whether links within the email were clicked.\nBoth web beacons and SDKs allow us to collect information such as the recipient\u2019s IP address, browser, email client type and other similar data as further described above details.\nWe use this information to measure the performance of your email campaigns, to provide analytics information, enhance the effectiveness of our Service, and for other purposes described above.\nReports are also available to us when we send email to you, so we may collect and review that information.</p>\n<p>Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed in more detail in our Cookie Statement available here.</p>\nE.\nMember Distribution Lists\n<p>In order to send an email campaign or use certain features in your account, you need to upload a Distribution List that provides us information about your Contacts, such as their names and email addresses.\nWe use and process this information to provide the Service in accordance with our contract with you or your organization and this privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p>A Distribution List can be created in a number of ways, including by importing Contacts, such as through a CSV or directly from your email client.\nWe do not, under any circumstances, sell your Distribution Lists.\nIf someone on your Distribution List complains or contacts us, we might then contact that person.\nYou may export (download) your Distribution Lists from Mailchimp by accessing the \u201cAudience\u201d tab from within your account.</p>\n<p>If we detect abusive or illegal behavior related to your Distribution List, we may share your Distribution List or portions of it with affected ISPs or anti-spam organizations to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>If a Contact chooses to use the Forward to a Friend (FTF) link in an email campaign a Member sends, it will allow the Contact to share the Member\u2019s email content with individuals not on the Member\u2019s Distribution List.\nWhen a Contact forwards an email to a friend, we do not store the Contact\u2019s email address or their friend\u2019s email address, and no one is added to any Distribution List as a result of the FTF link.\nThe Member who created the email campaign only sees an aggregate number of times their email campaign was forwarded by a Contact and does not have access to the email addresses used to share or receive that forwarded content.</p>\nF.\nYour Data Protection Rights\n<p>Depending on the country in which you reside, you may have the following data protection rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To access.\ncorrect.\nupdate.\nport.\ndelete.\nrestrict.\nor object to our processing of your Personal Information.\n</li>\n<li>You can manage your individual account and profile settings within the

dashboard provided through the Mailchimp platform to assist you with responding to requests to access, correct, update, port or delete information that you receive from your Contacts.\nNote, if any of your Contacts wish to exercise any of these rights, they should contact you directly, or contact us as described in the \u201cPrivacy for Contacts\u201d section below.\nYou can also contact us at any time to update your own marketing preferences (see Section 5.\nGeneral Information, C.\nYour Choices and Opt-Outs below).\nMailchimp takes reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and up to date.\n</li>\n<li>The right to complain to a data protection authority about the collection and use of Personal Information.\nFor more information, please contact your local data protection authority.\nContact details for data protection authorities in the EEA and UK are available here and Switzerland are available here.</li>\n<li>Similarly, if Personal Information is collected or processed on the basis of consent, the data subject can withdraw their consent at any time.\nWithdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your Personal Information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\nIf you receive these requests from Contacts, you can segment your lists within the Mailchimp platform to ensure that you only market to Contacts who have not opted out of receiving such marketing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection law.\nWe may ask you to verify your identity in order to help us respond efficiently to your request.\nIf we receive a request from one of your Contacts, we will either direct the Contact to reach out to you, or, if appropriate, we may respond directly to their request.</p> 3.\nPrivacy for Contacts <p>This section applies to the information we process about our Members\u2019 Contacts as a data controller.\nOur Service is intended for use by our Members.\nAs a result, for much of the Personal Information we collect and process about Contacts through the Service, we act as a processor on behalf of our

collect or receive about you broadly falls into the following categories:</p>\n<p>(i)<strong> Information we receive about Contacts from our Members:</strong> A Member may provide Personal Information

e-commerce account with Mailchimp), or when you sign up for a Member\u2019s Distribution List on a Mailchimp or other signup form, the Member may provide us with certain contact information or other Personal Information about you such as your name, email address, address, or telephone number.\nYou may have the opportunity to update some of this information by electing to update or manage your preferences via an email you receive from a Member.</p>\n<p>(ii) <strong>Information we collect automatically</strong>: When you interact with an email campaign that you receive from a Member or browse or purchase from a Member\u2019s connected store, we may collect information about your device and interaction with an email.\nWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect some of this information.\nOur use of cookies and other tracking technologies is discussed more below and in more detail in our Cookie Statement available here.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Device

prevent service abuse, and to ensure we attain certain usage standards and metrics in relation to our Service.\nWe also collect information regarding the performance of the Service, including metrics related to the deliverability of emails and other electronic communications that our Members send through the Service.\nThis information allows us to improve the content and operation of the Service and facilitate research and perform analysis into the use and performance of the Service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(iii) <strong>Information we collect from other sources:</strong> From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third-party sources, such as social media platforms, and third-party data providers.\n</p>\nB.\nUse of Personal Information\n<p>We may use the Personal Information we

or more of our functions or activities.\nPlease see Section 4, of this privacy policy for examples of the types of Personal Information we may ask Visitors to provide.</li>\n<li>Where we say we assume an obligation about Personal Information, we will also require our contractors and subcontractors to undertake a similar obligation.</li>\n<li>We will not use or disclose Personal Information for the purpose of our direct marketing to you unless: <ul>\n<li>you have consented to receive direct marketing.\n</li>\n<li>you would reasonably expect us to use your personal details for marketing.\nor</li>\n<li>we believe you may be interested in the material but it is impractical for us to obtain your consent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may opt out of any marketing

your Personal Information, you may do so by visiting this page, or by emailing us at personaldatarequests@mailchimp.com.\nWe will respond to all requests for access within a reasonable time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you think the information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant, or misleading, we will take reasonable steps, consistent with our obligations under the Australian Privacy Act, to correct that information upon your request.\nIf you find that the information we have is not up to date or is inaccurate or incomplete, please contact us in writing at dpo@mailchimp.com, so we can update our records.\nWe will respond to all requests for correction within a reasonable time.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are unsatisfied with our response to a

this course of action.</li>\n</ul>\nF.\nRetention of Data\n<p>We retain Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business or legal need to do so.\nOur retention periods will vary depending on the type of data involved, but, generally, we'll refer to these criteria in order to determine retention period:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whether we have a legal or contractual need to retain the data.</li>\n<li>Whether the data is necessary to provide our Service.</li>\n<li>Whether our Members have the ability to access and delete the data within their Mailchimp accounts.</li>\n<li>Whether our Members would reasonably expect that we would retain the data until they remove it or until their Mailchimp accounts are closed or terminated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\nG.\nCalifornia Privacy\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information.\nYou have the right to request that businesses subject to the CCPA (which may include our Members with whom you have a relationship) disclose certain information to you about their collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.\nIn addition, you have the right to ask such businesses to delete Personal Information collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.\nIf the business sells Personal Information, you have a right to opt-out of that sale.\nFinally, a business cannot discriminate against you for exercising a CCPA right.\n</p>\n<p>When offering services to its Members, Mailchimp acts as a \u201cservice provider\u201d under the CCPA and our receipt and collection of any consumer Personal Information is completed on behalf of our Members in order for us to provide the Service.\nPlease direct any requests for access or deletion of your Personal Information under the CCPA to the Member with whom you have a direct relationship.\n</p>\n<p>Consistent with California law, if you choose to exercise your applicable CCPA rights, we won\u2019t charge you different prices or provide you a different quality of services.\nIf we ever offer a financial incentive or product enhancement that is contingent upon you providing your Personal Information, we will not do so unless the benefits to you are reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information that you provide to us.\n</p>\nH.\nDo not Track\n<p>Certain state laws require us to indicate whether we honor \u201cDo Not Track\u201d settings in your browser.\nMailchimp adheres to the standards set out in this Privacy Policy and does not monitor or follow any Do Not Track browser requests.</p>\nI.\nChanges to this Policy\n<p>We may change this privacy policy at any time and from time to time.\nThe most recent version of the privacy policy is reflected by the version date

Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) and our Terms.\nMailchimp has open APIs that you can access at https://mailchimp.com/developer/ and https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/.\nWe provide these APIs to allow people to build on and benefit from our Service by creating software, services, or modules that connect to our platform or have access to the data within our platform via our APIs (an \u201cIntegration\u201d).\nThis Policy is and will be treated as part of our Terms.\nCapitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this Policy have the meanings given to them in our Terms.</p> 1.\nLogin <p>You\u2019ll only access the API using OAuth or an API key.\nIf you have an Integration, then users must have the option to log in via OAuth or their API key.\nYou won\u2019t prompt users to provide their Mailchimp username, password, or security questions.</p> 2.\nPermitted Use <p>You won\u2019t use the API to send spam or take any actions that violate our Acceptable Use Policy and our Standard Terms of Use.\nYou will comply with all applicable laws (including privacy laws and United States export control laws and regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations).\nYou\u2019ll follow all documentation we provide for the APIs.\nYou won\u2019t attempt to hack or change the way the Service functions.\nWe may throttle your use of the APIs at any time.\nWe may monitor your use of the APIs for compliance with these rules, and we may deny you access to the API if you violate this Policy.</p> 3.\nPrivacy <p>You\u2019ll respect the privacy of our users.\nYou must obtain express permission from each user before you access their Mailchimp account.\nYour Integration must display a privacy policy for users detailing the information you\u2019ll collect from them when they use the Integration.\nYou will only access a user\u2019s data to the extent permitted by the user and explained in your privacy policy.\nYou must immediately delete a user\u2019s data if the user requests deletion or terminates their account with you.\nAny user data which is collected by Mailchimp via your Integration will be treated in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p> 4.\nSecurity <p>You will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect and to preserve the security, integrity and confidentiality of the data of your users.\nThese security measures shall prevent the unauthorized access or disclosure of personal or confidential data that you process.\nYou must promptly report any security deficiencies or security incidents that may impact or compromise our users, APIs, or Service in writing to legal@mailchimp.com.\nAnd, if there is a security incident, you will work with us to immediately correct the incident or deficiency.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to review or audit your books, records, agreements, access logs, third-party audit and examination reports, systems, networks, facilities (including physical and remote access to data centers and cloud facilities), controls, policies and procedures related to your Integration to ensure compliance with this Policy.\nYou will promptly correct any security flaws or deficiencies.\nUpon remediation, you will certify in writing that you are now in compliance.</p> 5.\nLicense <p>We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited right to access and use the APIs to develop, test and support your Integration and to distribute or allow access to your Integration to users of your service, provided that you comply with this Policy and all applicable laws.\nYou have no right to distribute or allow access to our stand-alone APIs.\nWe may terminate your access to our APIs at any time for any reason.</p> 6.\nOwnership <p>We own all rights, titles, and interest in the Service and the APIs, including all intellectual property rights, marks, code, and features.\nYou won\u2019t infringe, reverse engineer, or copy our code, design, or content.\nYou will not access our APIs in order to compete with our Service.\nAny rights not expressly granted by this Policy are withheld, so if you don\u2019t see it here, then it\u2019s not a right we\u2019re giving you.\nYou own all rights, titles, and interest in the Integration, except for the APIs, our marks, and the Service.\nIf you provide feedback about the APIs or the Service, we may copy, modify, create derivative works, display, disclose, distribute, or use that feedback without any obligation to you.</p> 7.\nUse of Marks <p>You may only use our name and marks (meaning our logos, mascots, and copyrighted images) according to our Brand Guidelines.\nYou may not alter or remove any proprietary notices in our marks.\nYou won\u2019t use our name or marks in your Integration name or logo, or in any way that implies an endorsement by us (that includes putting your logo on Freddie).\nIf you use our marks to create your logo or name, you\u2019ll immediately assign those rights to us at no expense.</p> 8.\nDisclaimer <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we provide the APIs as-is.\nThat means we don\u2019t provide warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p> 9.\nUpdates <p>We may update or modify the APIs and this Policy from time to time by posting the changes on this site or notifying you via email.\nThese changes may affect your use of the APIs or the way your Integration interacts with the API.\nIf we make a change that\u2019s unacceptable to you, you should stop using the APIs.</p> 10.\nConfidentiality <p>You may have access to confidential, proprietary, and non-public information specific to the APIs (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\nYou may use this information only to build with the APIs.\nYou won\u2019t disclose the Confidential Information to anyone without our written consent, and you\u2019ll protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure in the same way you\u2019d protect your own confidential information.</p> 11.\nIndemnification <p>You\u2019ll indemnify and hold us and our Team harmless from any losses (including attorney fees) that result from third-party claims that relate to your use of the API.</p> 12.\nThe Rest <p>This Policy doesn\u2019t create or imply any partnership, agency, or joint venture.\nThis Policy will apply for as long as you use the APIs or until terminated in accordance with our Terms.\nIn the event of a conflict between this Policy and the Standard Terms of Use, the Standard Terms of Use shall control.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Updated May 27, 2020</em>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2019-04-27 03:34:37.099375",
