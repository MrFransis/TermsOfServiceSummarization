supplements the information contained elsewhere in this Privacy Notice and applies solely to all visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (\"consumers\" or \"you\").\nWe adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.</p>Rights and Choices<p>The CCPA provides consumers located in the state of California with certain rights regarding their personal information and data.\nThe following section describes those rights and explains how to exercise them:</p>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights<p>You have the right to request that the company disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (as described in the section \"Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights\"), we will disclose to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>\n<li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>\n<li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called data portability request)</li>\n<li>If we sold or disclose your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists

information categories that each category of recipient obtained</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>Non-Discrimination<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nUnless

penalties.</li>\n<li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n<li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level of quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects.</p>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights<p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at support@rblxtrade.com</p>\n<p>Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information.\nYou may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>\n<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access of data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>\n<li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>Information We Collect<p>Our websites, emails (with your consent, where required by law), and other products, services and platforms collect information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer

kind of data we collect.\nFor full details, read out Terms of Service and Privacy Policy here.</p>What data does RblxTrade directly collect?<ul>\n<li>\n<p>IP Addresses</p>\n<p>RblxTrade collects IP Addresses for the purpose of preventing abuse of our website and infrastructure.\nThere are a few main areas where we collect IP Addresses, and none of the areas are attached directly to you and/or your Roblox account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Rate Limiting</p>\n<p>When you make a request to our website (e.g.\nvisit a web page), we store your IP address in a datastore, along with how many requests the IP has made to our site in the past minute.\nOnce you exceed the maximum amount of requests allowed within 1 minute, your IP is temporarily banned from accessing our website.\nThis is so that we can prevent a user (and/or automated program) from spamming our website with requests, potentially causing an outage or other issues.\nWe <b>do not</b> store any other information alongside your ip.\nThis means that your IP is <b>never</b> directly linked to your Roblox account, user agent string, or any other information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Requesting User Updates</p>\n<p>When you request a refresh on a users inventory (by clicking the \"Request Refresh\" button), we store the User ID you requested an update for, as well as your IP address.\nThis, similar to Rate Limiting, is so that we can prevent users (and/or automated programs) from spamming update requests on users, potentially causing a massive unnecessary backlog in user inventory scanning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Logging In</p>\n<p>When you login to RblxTrade using your Roblox username, we record your IP address in a datastore so that we can prevent a user from signing in multiple times on the same IP.\nThe data stored <b>does not</b> contain your Roblox Username, ID, or any other information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Forum Thread Creation and Forum Post Creation</p>\n<p>If you use our Forum service and create a thread and/or forum, your IP address is stored in a datastore in order for us to prevent specific IP addresses from spamming forum threads/posts.\nYour IP address is stored alone, so no other data is associated with it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User Agent Strings</p>\n<p>RblxTrade collects user agent strings in order to track requests across our website.\nYour user agent string is provided by your web browser, and contains limited information about your device, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Web Browser and version (e.g.\n\"Chrome/58.0.3029.110\")</li>\n<li>Your operating system (e.g.\n\"Windows NT 10.0\")</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any time you make a request to our website, your user agent string is stored in a datastore, alongside the URL you requested (e.g.\n\"/\" if you visit the homepage), and the IP of the cloudflare server you were routed to.\nNo other information is stored alongside your user agent, so this means that your user agent is never linked to your Roblox account,

obtain and/or store Email addresses, passwords, or any other personal information.\nIf our website were to be compromised, all the compromisers would have access to is a giant list of IP addresses and another giant list of User Agents with no other information linked - this data would be essentially useless.</p>About<p>RblxTrade is a Roblox trading website founded in 2019.\nWe offer deep insights
