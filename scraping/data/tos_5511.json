"<p>Version 1.2 posted and effective as of January 18th, 2021.</p>\n<p>Version 1.1 posted on June 11th, 2020 and effective until and including January 17th, 2021.</p>\n<p>THESE TERMS OF USE (OR \u201c<strong>TERMS</strong>\u201d FOR SHORT) ARE A LEGAL CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND TRANSIT (\u201c<strong>US</strong>\u201d OR \u201c<strong>WE</strong>\u201d).\nTHEY GOVERN YOUR INSTALLATION AND USE OF THE TRANSIT MOBILE APPLICATION (THE \u201c<strong>APP</strong>\u201d), AS WELL AS YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF ALL SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH OR ENABLED BY THE APP (THE \u201c<strong>SERVICES</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY, SINCE THIS DOCUMENT INCLUDES LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AS WELL AS DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES, AND OTHER TERMS WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, OR IF YOU LACK CAPACITY OR AUTHORITY TO AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE APP OR ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>1.\nChanges to these Terms<p>We may amend any part of these Terms by adding, deleting, or varying their content.\nThese amendments may be made at any time and from time-to-time in our discretion.</p>\n<p>We will provide you with notice of the proposed amendment by posting an amended version of these Terms with a new version number.\nWe will include a link to the previous version of the terms beneath the new version number.\nThe amendments will take effect 30 days after the date on which the amended version is posted.\nPrior to that date, the previous version of the Terms will continue to apply.</p>\n<p>If you disagree with any amendments, you may terminate these Terms by uninstalling the App and ceasing to use the Services at any time within the 30-day notice period.\nIf the amendment increases your obligations under these Terms, or decreases our obligations under these Terms, then you can also cancel in the 30 days after the amendments take effect.\nThere will be no cost or penalty for doing so.\nIf you do not uninstall the App and cease using the Services during that time, then by your continued use, you are considered to have accepted the proposed amendments.</p>2.\nScope of Services<p>To get the most out of the App, it is important to understand our role in providing the Services.\nThe App and Services contain material that we produce and own in order to make mobility services in your city easy to use.\nThis material includes, but is not limited to software, text, graphics and images (\"Transit Content\").\nHowever, we do not produce any of the primary information you see in the App, which is provided to us by third parties such as Transit Agencies and mobility operators (Uber, Lyft, Bird, Lime, etc.).\nWe are an information organizer and aggregator.\nThis information includes the locations of public transit, the availability of bikeshare or carshare services, and the map itself.\nWhile third parties are the primary provider of predictions regarding arrival and departure times, we may develop additional information based on the above referenced location or availability of services, for example by modifying expected arrival times.\nSuch times are only estimates.\nThe actual timings are based on a number of factors including traffic, boarding, detours and the like, which are beyond our control.\nBoth Transit and the primary information providers work to ensure that the information is correct and up-to-date.\nHowever, we cannot reasonably verify all of this information, let alone in real-time.\nThis means that if the information provided to us by third parties is inaccurate or incomplete, your ability to effectively use the App or Services may be compromised through no fault of Transit, and in those cases any legal responsibility for any problems or damages which might occur lies with the third-party information provider rather than (and to the exclusion of) Transit itself.</p>\n<p>Similarly, if you are able to purchase third party goods and services through the App, we are acting as a broker to refer you to the seller of those goods or provider of those services.\nIn some cases we may process payments or aggregate services or usage of those services to provide you with additional benefits.\nWe do not act as agent for either you or that third party, and instead you contract directly with the third party.\nYour purchase of the goods or services will be subject to separate contracts and terms of use in addition to these Terms.\nAny disputes or legal claims for problems or damages arising from or related to these third-party contracts, goods, or services, or any third-party websites or apps which are used in the process must be addressed exclusively to those third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>However, such disputes or claims shall be addressed to Transit when purchasing public transit tickets in Montreal, QC, where Transit shall act as the merchant of record.\nFor such purchases, all sales are final, and any customer service requests, disputes and chargebacks shall be addressed to and handled by Transit.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to access certain services, you may be required to create a Transit account.\nIf you do so, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Transit account.\nYou further agree to accept all responsibility for actions and activities that occur using that account.</p>\n<p>In all cases, our ability to deliver all the functionality of the Services requires a stable data connection and access to locational services like GPS.\nIf your phone\u2019s ability to access data via wireless networks or the Internet is compromised, the Services may be delivered incompletely, slowly, inaccurately, or not at all.\nThese connectivity problems can arise from many sources, ranging from physical interference to power outages to errors by telecommunication providers.\nOnce again, your ability to effectively use the App or Services may be compromised through no fault of Transit, and we cannot accept any responsibility for any problems or damages which might occur.</p>\n<p>The Services also depend on your device.\nIf your device is damaged, not compatible with the App (including updates to the App), or if you have turned off permissions on which the App relies to deliver all the functionality of the Services (such as location sharing), then your ability to effectively use the App or Services may be compromised through no fault of Transit, and we cannot accept any responsibility for any problems or damages which might occur.</p>\n<p>From time to time we may need to make the App or the Services unavailable in order to fix bugs, perform maintenance, install updates, or similar tasks that improve the overall service we deliver.\nWe make every effort to do so during times that have the least impact, but we cannot accept any responsibility for problems or damages that occur because of App or Services unavailability for these reasons.</p>\n<p>Finally, our ability to effectively deliver the Services via the App depends on you having access to the latest version of the App.\nIf you delay or refuse updates to the App, this may compromise or completely prevent us from delivering the Services.\nWe cannot accept any responsibility for any problems or damages which might occur</p>3.\nTransit Royale<p>3.1.\nWithin the App, we offer certain features and enhanced functionality as paid services.\nThese are referred to as \u201c<strong>Transit Royale</strong>\u201d.\nThese services are generally tied to a subscription, i.e.\nthe regular purchase of the services over a fixed period of time for a specific fee.</p>\n<p>3.2.\nThe benefits included in Transit Royale may change from time to time, as we introduce new features, develop our existing offering and sometimes retire features that aren't working out as planned.\nThe features and content contained in Transit Royale may differ by country and language.\nThe applicable price offer is shown in the relevant app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store) and on the buy screen in-app prior to purchase.</p>\n<p>3.3.\nLike the Application itself, Transit Royale is only available via the third-party platform operators Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\nTherefore, when you make a purchase within the Application, you additionally enter into a separate contract with the respective third-party service provider, whose terms and conditions apply.\nYour right to cancel your subscription must be exercised against these service providers (for more details about contract duration and termination see <strong>3.7-3.8</strong>).</p>\n<p>3.4.\nTransit Royale is available on a subscription basis.\nTherefore, you will be charged once at the beginning of your subscription period (for instance per month or per year).\nYour subscription will automatically be renewed at the applicable price at the end of each subscription period for an equal duration (or 1 year if your previous subscription was for a longer period), unless you have cancelled your subscription, disabled auto-renewals or if we terminate your subscription.\nIf you received a free trial offer, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the free trial period for the price indicated when you subscribed to the free trial.\nWhen you cancel a free trial or subscription, you are cancelling the next billing charge.\nYou will continue to have access to Transit Royale until the end of your current subscription period, regardless of when you cancel the automatic renewal (i.e.\nyou can cancel at any time after your subscription starts and continue to access Transit Royale features through the end of your subscription period).</p>\n<p>3.5.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change our prices for Transit Royale at any time.\nWe will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the mobile app and/or by sending you an email notification.\nIf you do not wish to pay the new prices, you can cancel your subscription prior to the change going into effect.\nYou will be charged the revised price at the start of your next subscription period (for instance, per month or per year) or on the renewal of your subscription.</p>\n<p>3.6.\nIf payment cannot be collected, we will be entitled to block access to Transit Royale.</p>\n<p>3.7.\nWe do not issue refunds for termination or cancellation of Transit Royale.\nIf you no longer wish to subscribe, you are responsible for cancelling your subscription in due time, regardless of whether or not you actually use Transit Royale features.\nPlease note that your request to cancel automatic renewal must be made using the same platform (the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store) on which you originally subscribed (or started a free trial)and that the terms and conditions of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store apply to such cancelation.\nApple and Google generally require a notice of termination or non-renewal to be provided no later than 24 hours before the renewal of the subscription, but you should refer to Apple or Google up to date policies and terms.</p>\n<p>3.8.\nTo the extent and in such circumstances where required by applicable law, you may terminate your subscription to Transit Royale and receive a reimbursement for the unused subscription period.\nWe may terminate your access to Transit Royale, without any obligation to reimburse fees paid in advance, if you breach applicable law, if you breach your obligations under these Terms, or your obligations under the contract governing your use of theApple App Store or Google Play Store (or if your actions would cause us to breach our contracts with Apple or Google).\nNo prior notice of termination is required in these situations.</p>4.\nAccess to Servicesa) Limited Use Right<p>We do not sell the App or any of the intellectual property contained in the App.\nInstead, you are licenced to download a single copy of the App onto each one of your devices.</p>\n<p>Subject to your compliance with these terms, and for as long as we make the Services available through the App, you are hereby granted a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferrable right to use the Services via the App.\nFor greater certainty, this does not include any right to directly access the software, databases, algorithms or data which powers the Services and App, nor any right to obtain a copy of the source code or architecture thereof.</p>\n<p>Our role is to make the App and Services available.\nAs explained in the previous section, we cannot control \u2013 nor accept any responsibility for \u2013 any other issues.</p>\n<p>Your use right under these Terms is a personal, non-commercial right.\nIt does not extend to others, nor commercial activities, nor is it an enterprise-wide right.</p>b) Prohibited Uses and Activities<p>When installing the App and using the Services, you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the legislation known as Canada\u2019s Anti-Spam Law, SC 2010, c 23 (CASL).</p>\n<p>When installing the App and using the Services, you must not: (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, investigate, or otherwise access any non-UI portion of the App.\n(ii) circumvent any limitations we place on your use of the App or Services.\n(iii) use or display the App in such a way that allows derivation of information about the Services that was not intended to be made available to users.\n(iv) circumvent any security features or technological protection measures built into the App.\n(v) automate access to the App or the Services, including, without limitation, through the use of bots, scrapers or other similar devices.\n(vi) attempt to install the App or access the Services after having been banned by us.</p>5.\nDisclaimer of Warranties<p>\n<strong>NOT APPLICABLE TO QUEBEC CONSUMERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WE HEREBY EXCLUDE ALL CONDITIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE

UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE BY US.</p>6.\nLimitation of Liability<p>\n<strong>NOT APPLICABLE TO QUEBEC CONSUMERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WE

APPLY TO ALL DAMAGES HOWEVER CAUSED, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PROPERTY, PRIVACY, STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE.</p>\n<p>NOTABLY, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOST TIME, OR LEGAL FEES AND LITIGATION EXPENSES.</p>7.\nTermination and

without cause at any time by uninstalling the App and ceasing to use the Services.</p>b) Survival<p>Clauses 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 shall survive the termination of these Terms regardless of reason, and
