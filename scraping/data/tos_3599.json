simple and accessible to all.\nUnless otherwise indicated, it is applicable to any website that references the policy.\n<br>\n<br> \u201cService\u201d refers to our services which can be accessed on our website at https://www.techlore.tech.\nThe terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to Techlore.\n\u201cYou\u201d refers to you, as a user of our services.\nI.\nCONSENT By accessing our website &amp.\nServices, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n<br>\n<br> Each time you visit our website, or use the Service, and any time you voluntarily provide us with information, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide.\nII.\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT <b>Our Goal Is To Not Know Who You Are</b>\n<br>\n<br> To protect our hinds, we will state: We may collect both \u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d and \u201cPersonal Information\u201d about you.\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d includes information that cannot be directly used to personally identify you, such as basic browser information (Ex.\nFirefox on Linux) This is standard on most hosting services, and we\u2019ve disabled everything we can to collect as little as possible in addition to choosing a host known to respect user privacy - Orange Website.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\u201cPersonal Information\u201d includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name and email address.\nThis is never collected unless you optionally submit it to us through a contact form or other communication method.\nWe don't typically verify the information supplied, so you have the full ability to use aliases when contacting us.\nWe have several recommendations for aliasing services on our resources page.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>We do not utilize cookies, we don't track you through scripts, and we do not implement trackers on our website to analyze your behavior.\nThe only exception to this is our YouTube content embedded on this website which may have the indirect ability of tracking users.\nWe recommend using browser tools to block trackers that may be used by the embedded tool if this concerns you - or alternatively you may disable Javascript, though this may break some tools on our site.</li> III.\nHOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION <b>We do not sell, trade, rent or share your Personal Information we collect with third parties.\nPeriod.\nYour data stays with us and only us.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>In some scenarios, a third-party may be involved in handling your information to provide a Service.\nGenerally, these third-parties will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the required services.\nFor example, when you provide us with personal information to contact us, your email and message is passed through Formspree.\nWe always attempt to offer alternatives when available - in the Formspree example you are able to directly contact us through our support email.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>It's important to mention certain third-party service providers, such as payment processors, have their own privacy policies we have no control over.\nWe recommend you read their privacy policies so that you can understand the manner in which your Personal Information will be handled by such providers.\nWe aim to offer more private alternatives to users when the option is available.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>In regards to how your information is used, the answer is simply to perform the Service you require.\nUnlike most companies, we don't have anything to gain from your data.</b> IV.\nHOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION We implement strong precautions to protect your Personal Information to our best ability.\nWhile we cannot guarantee your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by a breach of such precautions, we are doing everything in our power to prevent it from ever happening.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to this risk.</b> V.\nLINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES As part of our Service, we may provide links to other websites or applications.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain.\nWe are doing our best to educate users and make improvements where we can to offer the best privacy - but we aren't perfect and neither are our selections.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.\nIf you dislike a site we reference or utilize - don't use it.</b> VI.\nCHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time.\nIf we change this Privacy Policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.\nIt is your sole responsibility to check this website to view any such changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not agree to any changes, if and when such changes may be made to this Privacy Policy, you must cease access to this website.\nVII.\nEMAIL COMMUNICATIONS &amp.\nOPTING OUT Based upon the Personal Information that you provide us, we may communicate with you in response to your inquiries to provide the services you request.\nWe will communicate with you by email in accordance with your wishes.\nIf you would like to opt out and/or have all data we hold tied to you deleted, send a request to support@techlore.tech VIII.\nCONTACT US &amp.\nWITHDRAWING CONSENT If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices of this Site, please
