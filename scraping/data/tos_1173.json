device.\nThird parties may also use this to recognise you when you are on other websites and mobile applications.</p>\n<p>Cookies are useful for a variety of purposes.\nFor example, they allow you to navigate between pages efficiently and allow us to remember preferences and generally improve your user experience.\nThey are also used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites.\nFor example, when you view certain products on our Site or have interacted with certain pages on our Site, we may use this information to show you advertisements which may interest you.\nSimilarly, third parties that place cookies on our Site may use this type of information to present you with tailored advertising when you other their websites.</p>\n<p>Session cookies

third-party cookies.\nPlease note that Newegg has no access to or control over third-party technologies and information about their data collection practices should be found on their respective websites.</p>\nWhat cookies does Newegg use?\n<p>We describe below the categories of cookies that are set by Newegg and its partners when you visit the Site.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Strictly Necessary cookies</strong>\n<br>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Site and use its features and cannot be turned off.\nWithout these cookies, services you have asked for (such as navigating between pages, placing an order and using a shopping cart or e-billing services) cannot be provided.\nTherefore, you cannot disable these cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance cookies</strong>\n<br>We make use of performance cookies to analyse how our visitors use the Site and to monitor the Site\u2019s performance.\nThis allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering, and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise.<br>For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.\nWe might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the Site.\nThe information collected by these cookies is not associated with your personal data by us or by our contractors.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functional cookies</strong>\n<br>These cookies are used to provide you with certain functionality on the Site.\nFor example, to improve the performance of our services and the Site, to maintain security on the Site and to prevent and detect fraud, to customise your account, to display certain web page content based upon your browser type and other device information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising cookies</strong>\n<br>Subject to your cookie settings, Newegg and various third party ad partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies to

about you through your use of their service in order to present you with targeted advertising via their platforms.\nFor example, where you have provided permission, we allow Facebook to place a cookie on your device.\nWhen you return to Facebook, Facebook can identify you as a user of the Newegg Site and can therefore provide you with advertising messages from us.<br>In other situations, third parties use cookies so that they can retarget Newegg\u2019s products to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, or to predict what advertisements about third party products are likely to be of interest to you based on your browsing activities.\n<br>Please note that if you opt out of advertising cookies, you will still be presented with advertisements online.\nThese

deleted when you delete the email.\nIf you do not wish the pixel to be downloaded to your device, you should select to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML, and you should not click links that we send you.\nYou can opt-out of receiving marketing emails by clicking the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link located at the bottom of all Newegg marketing emails or by sending an email to
