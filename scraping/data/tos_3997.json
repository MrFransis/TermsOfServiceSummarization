disclosures found elsewhere on our Websites as well as reflect your privacy rights granted by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) with effect from January 1, 2020.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opt-out of disclosure for direct marketing purposes.</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to learn the identities of entities that received their personal data for marketing purposes and the categories of information disclosed.\nYou may request such information by contacting us by e-mail addressed to support@macupdate.com.\nPlease reference California Privacy Rights in your subject line.\nYou may also write to us at:</p>\n<p>Unit No: 3005-D6, Swiss Tower, Plot No: JLT-PH2-Y3A, Jumeirah Lakes Towers, Dubai, UAE.</p>\n<p>Please be aware this opt-out does not prohibit our disclosure of personal data for any purposes other than direct marketing.\nThe data we process and share may include your name, address, email address, and telephone number.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic gathering of information.</strong> We collect data you provide to us online, and through websites of unaffiliated third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic gathering of information by third parties.</strong> When you visit our Websites, third parties can collect personal data about your online activities over time and across different websites pertaining to your visit to or to the use of our and other websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do-not-track requests.</strong> California residents visiting may request we do not automatically gather and track information pertaining to their online browsing movements across the internet.\nSuch requests are typically made through web browser settings that control signals or other mechanisms providing consumers with the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal data about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services.\nWe currently do not have the ability to perform such tracking, but only track your interaction with our Services.</p>\n<p>The CCPA has extended California residents' data protection rights.\nHowever, we have already guaranteed all these rights and described them precisely in this Notice as well as a means of rights exercising.\nPlease refer below to investigate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to be informed.</strong> Please find a list of personal data we collect about you and your activity, sources and business purposes of personal data collection, and third parties we may share your personal data with in the Section 3 - 7 of the Notice.</p>\n<p>Your <strong>Right of access, Data portability, and Right to delete</strong> are prescribed by Section 10 of the Notice.</p>\n<p>You can exercise these rights any time by contacting us via:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page to learn more about cookies opt-out.</li>\n<li>Ticket form on our Website.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note, the CCPA envisages some specific requirements related to the exercising of these data protection rights.\nConsidering them, we may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>respond to your request within forty-five (45) days of receipt;</li>\n<li>provide you with personal data we collected about you no more than twice in a 12-month period (categories and specific pieces of collected personal data, business purpose and sources of collection, categories of third parties personal data is shared with);</li>\n<li>NOT provide you with personal data if we cannot verify your identity.\nYou shall provide us with sufficient information allowing us to verify you as the person about whom we collected personal data.\nHowever, we do consider requests made through your Account sufficiently verified.</li>\n<li>NOT transmit your personal data to another entity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, please be aware we are allowed to maintain personal data after a deletion request is received as permitted by the CCPA (for instance, for the purposes of detection of security incidents, repair errors, compliance with legal obligations, transaction completion).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We want to highlight how Clario does not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to anyone.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Non-discrimination right.\nWe definitely will not discriminate (including, by denying Services, charging different prices for Services, providing different quality of Services) against you for exercising any of your CCPA data protection rights.</p>12.\n\u201cDo not call\u201d list<p>Clario works with incoming calls from people who need our help.\nIf you use Customer Support as part of Clario Services, an agent from Customer Support
