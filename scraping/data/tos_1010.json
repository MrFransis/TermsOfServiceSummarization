violate our policies we may terminate your account.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t do anything illegal, abusive towards others, or that abuses our site in a technical way.\nIf you are a creator raising funds on Patreon, we may be held accountable for what you do with those funds.\nAs a result, we also look at what you do with your membership off our platform.</p>\n<p>You can find more detailed information in the Community Guidelines and Security Policy.\nThese policies cover most issues, but if you find a new and creative way to hurt Patreon or our community we may take action to prevent it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>All about being a creatorTo summarize: A creator is someone who creates a membership page on Patreon to engage with patrons who have purchased memberships from Patreon to support the creator\u2019s creations.\nThere are a lot of details below involving payments, fees, taxes and restrictions that you should read in full if you are a creator.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Membership</p>\n<p>To become a creator, simply launch your page to start your membership.\nWhen you join Patreon, you become part of the Patreon community.\nYou can use creator tools that Patreon provides, showcase your creations, provide merchandise to patrons through Patreon\u2019s Merch service, and receive recurring revenue from your page.\nMemberships are for your most passionate fans.\nOn Patreon, you can provide your patrons something exciting that gives them unique benefits they want, like additional access, merchandise, exclusivity, and engaging experiences.\nIn turn, you will receive loyal support from your patrons, and recurring revenue from memberships that patrons have purchased from Patreon.</p>\n<p>Payments</p>\n<p>As a creator you make your membership available on Patreon, and we provide membership to your patrons on a subscription basis.\nWe also handle payments issues such as fraud, chargebacks and resolution of payments disputes.</p>\n<p>We try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in accessing your funds.\nWe may also block or hold payments for violations of our policies or for compliance reasons, including collecting tax reporting information.\nWhen payments are delayed or blocked we try to communicate the reason to you promptly.\nIf you have questions about a payments block, please reach out to us.\nIn order to protect creators, we may block patrons\u2019 payments if we believe them to be fraudulent.</p>\n<p>Sometimes activities like refunds can put your account balance into the negative.\nIf your balance becomes negative then we reserve the right to recover those funds from future payments.</p>\n<p>Fees</p>\n<p>As a creator there are two fees associated with your membership on Patreon.\nThe first is the platform fee, which varies depending on the level of service you select.\nThe second is the payment processing fee, which is dependent on the currency selected by the creator.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The payment processing fee in US Dollars is 2.9% plus $0.30 per successful pledge for pledges over $3, and 5% fee plus $0.10 per successful pledge for pledges of $3 or less.PayPal payments from non-US patrons have an additional 1% fee.\nFounding creators have a legacy platform fee and the legacy payment processing rate.\nThe legacy payment processing rate varies depending on a number of factors, including the membership subscription amount, card type and number of other memberships joined by a patron.</li>\n<li>The payment processing fee in Euro is 3.4% plus \u20ac0.35 per successful pledge for pledges over \u20ac3, and 5% fee plus \u20ac0.15 per successful pledge for pledges of \u20ac3 or less.</li>\n<li>The payment processing fee in British Pounds is 3.4% plus \u00a30.35 per successful pledge for pledges over \u00a33, and 5% fee plus \u00a30.15 per successful pledge for pledges of \u00a33 or less.</li>\n</ul>You can see how much processing fees are for any membership subscription on your creator dashboard.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on your patrons\u2019 locations, some banks may charge your patron a foreign transaction fee for their membership subscription.\nPatreon does not control this charge, but it is typically around 3.0% .</p>\n<p>Tax</p>\n<p>We collect tax identification information and report this to tax authorities as legally required.\nYou are responsible for reporting any income or withholding taxes which may be due as a result of payments received.\nYou can learn more in our Tax Help Center.</p>\n<p>We are additionally responsible for a number of transactional taxes across the world.\nThese include but are not limited to VAT on payments for electronically supplied services to patrons in the EU, GST as an operator of an electronic distribution platform (EDP) within Australia, and state sales tax as a result of \u2018marketplace laws\u2019 within the United States.\nFor the purpose of electronically-supplied services, creators make a supply of those services to us, and then we supply them to the patron.\nTo learn more about how we handle transaction taxes, please check our VAT guide.</p>\n<p>In locales where Patreon is required to collect transaction tax from patrons, pledges processed from patrons will reflect the tier or custom pledge amount plus the applicable tax.\nApplicable tax will not be taken from a pledge, but rather will be charged in addition to the pledge.\nOnce settled, the tax amount will be automatically deducted for remittance to the applicable taxing authority.\nA record of the transaction tax portion of the pledge will be available on your earnings details page.</p>\n<p>As a creator on our site, it is your responsibility to provide accurate information when you are engaging with the sales tax weighting tool and, generally, when listing benefits transferred within your tiers.\n</p>\n<p>Restrictions</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t allow creations and benefits that violate our policies.\nYou can learn more by visiting our Community Guidelines and Benefit Guidelines.\nA summary of those rules is that we don\u2019t allow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Illegal creations or benefits.</li>\n<li>Creations or benefits that are abusive towards other people.</li>\n<li>Creations or benefits that use others' intellectual property, unless you have written permission to use it, or your use is protected by fair use.</li>\n<li>Creations or benefits with real people engaging in sexual acts.</li>\n<li>Benefits that involve raffles or prizes based on chance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If your fans include people under the age of 18, then please remind them that they need permission to join your membership, and those under the age of 13 cannot use Patreon.\nWe are not required to allow any particular person or group of persons to be your patron.</p>\n<p>As a creator you are also responsible for keeping patron data safe.\nYou can see what is required in our Data Processing Agreement.</p>\n<p>An account is tied to your creative output and cannot be sold or transferred for use by another creator.</p>\n<p>\n</p>All about being a patronTo summarize: A patron is someone who purchases memberships from Patreon to support their favorite creators\u2019 creations.\nThrough a paid membership on Patreon, patrons directly interact with creators they support, using tools supplied by Patreon, and through our platform have the opportunity to engage with a greater community of patrons and creators.<p>\n</p>\n<p>As a patron, you\u2019re joining Patreon to be part of an exciting movement to support a creator\u2019s membership while you get special benefits, like access to your creator, merchandise (when offered), exclusivity, and engaging experiences with the creator and patron community.\nIn exchange, you pay Patreon for membership programs, on a subscription basis, to access and support creators you like.\nTo become a patron, simply create an account, add your preferred payment method, and join a membership program on Patreon to start supporting your creator!</p>\n<p>There are three types of membership subscriptions.\nOne is a monthly subscription where you pay per month.\nThe second is a per creation subscription where you pay based on the number of creations a creator posts in that month.\nYou can set a limit on the number of creations you pay for in a single month under the per subscription model.\nThe third membership option is an annual membership, where you pay for a year of access up front, at a discounted rate.\nNot all offerings allow for all three subscription types.\nYour options will be presented to you in the payment flow.</p>\n<p>The timing and amount of each membership subscription depends on the type of membership agreement you enter into, and the creator you support.\nYou can see the details as you join, as well as in the receipt sent to you after each successful payment.\nYou can view all your active membership subscriptions and billing history on your membership page.</p>\n<p>You may cancel your membership payments at any time.\nAnnual memberships may be cancelled, or increased, but not lowered.\nTerminating or lowering the tier support of membership will go into effect in the subsequent (not current) payment term, except for annual memberships which can be terminated or increased but not lowered.\nIncreasing your payment to a higher tier level in an annual membership will go into effect in the current payment term.\nWhen you increase your payment for an annual membership during the term, you will get a credit for any payment already made in that term.</p>\n<p>For monthly or per creation payments, canceling your support may result in your loss of access to a creator\u2019s patron-only posts and benefits.</p>\n<p>These include when you cancel your membership subscription, your payment method fails, the creator blocks you, or the creator deletes their account.\nWe are not required to allow you to be a patron of any particular creator.</p>\n<p>Creators\u2019 memberships vary and we have limited control over the quality and specific offerings.\nWe attempt to screen for fraudulent creator pages, but cannot guarantee the identity of creators or the validity of any claims they make.\nWe appreciate your help reporting suspicious creator pages so we can keep Patreon safe.</p>\n<p>If you are located in the jurisdiction in which Patreon is required to charge and collect tax (e.g.\nVAT or, sales tax), then this tax is added to the total charge.\nExcept in limited circumstances, this tax is shown when you set up the initial membership subscription.\nPatreon remits all tax collected to the applicable taxing authority.\nAs tax is largely dependant on your location, you are responsible for keeping your address complete and up to date.</p>\n<p>Depending on your location, some banks may charge you a foreign transaction fee for your membership subscription.\nPatreon does not control this charge, but it is typically around 3% .\nPlease contact your bank for more information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Refunds</b>.\nOur policy is No Refunds, though we will allow for some exceptions where refunds are granted in our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Patreon\u2019s roleTo summarize: We proactively look at some pages and posts on Patreon and review reported pages to identify potential violations of our guidelines.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We proactively look at some pages and posts on Patreon to make sure creators follow our Community Guidelines and Benefit Guidelines.\nWe also investigate reports of potential violations.\nThese investigations may take a while to resolve and may include looking at what is supported by funds received through Patreon.</p>\n<p>In most situations we will work with creators to resolve any potential violations and allow the creator to continue using Patreon.\nTerminating accounts is not an action we take lightly and is done in only the most extreme cases.</p>\n<p>Patreon reserves the right to remove a creator or patron from participating in annual memberships.\nRemoval of the creator or patron from participation in annual memberships will prohibit the creator from accepting new annual payments, and prohibit the patron from making new annual payments, but will not result in an automatic removal of the creator or patron from the platform, unless there is an independent basis for their removal from the platform.</p>\n<p>Please let us know if you see potential violations of our Community Guidelines.\nYou can learn how to report them here.</p>\n<p>As a global company based in the United States with operations in other countries, we must comply with economic sanctions and trade restrictions, including those implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\") of the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury.\nThis means that Patreon cannot take part in transactions that involve designated people, places, or items that originate from those places, as determined by agencies like OFAC.\nYou can read our Sanctions Policy here.</p>\n<p>We are constantly testing out new features with the goal of making Patreon better.\nWe may add or remove features, and often test features with a random subset of our community.\nIf we believe a feature is significantly different from these terms, then we explain those differences in the test.</p>\n<p>With your permission, we may give other websites or services the ability to verify information about your Patreon account or perform actions on your behalf.\nThis permission is asked for when you connect your Patreon account to these other websites or services.\nYou can learn more in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Account deletionTo summarize: You can delete your account here.\nWe can disable your account at our discretion.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can permanently delete your account at any time by going to our Privacy Center.\nOn that page you can also see what information is deleted and what we continue to store after the account is deleted.</p>\n<p>We can terminate or suspend your account at any time at our discretion.\nWe can also cancel any membership subscriptions and remove any descriptions, posts or benefits at our discretion.</p>\n<p>You may not bring a claim against us for suspending or terminating another person\u2019s account, and you agree you will not bring such a claim.\nIf you try to bring such a claim, you are responsible for the damages caused, including attorneys fees and costs.</p>\n<p>These terms remain in effect even if you no longer have an account.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Your creationsTo summarize: You keep complete ownership of all creations, but you give us permission to use them on Patreon.\nMake sure you have permission to use creations that you offer on Patreon.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You keep full ownership of all creations that you offer on Patreon, but we need licenses from you to operate Patreon effectively.</p>\n<p>By posting

works of your creation.\nThe purpose of this license is strictly limited to allow us to provide and promote memberships to your patrons.\nWe will never try to steal your creations or use them in an exploitative way.</p>\n<p>You may not post creations that infringe others' intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>\n<p>Patrons may not use creations posted by creators in any way not authorized by the creator.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Your third-party appsTo summarize: You may grant Patreon permission to access third-party apps.\nYou may also revoke that permission.<p>\n</p>\n<p>You may grant Patreon access to your third-party accounts, such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Twitch, in order for some Patreon features to operate.\nEach time you connect your third-party account, that third-party account will present a page that describes the information that Patreon can access.</p>\n<p>At any time, you can revoke Patreon\u2019s access to those accounts using the respective third party\u2019s security settings page.</p>\n<p>These are the links for each service:</p>GoogleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyRevoke Patreon's AccessYouTubeTerms of

diverse community and, while you may not necessarily agree with someone\u2019s point of view, it may not be a violation of our Community Guidelines.\nThat said, when you see a page on Patreon that you feel violates our community guidelines, please take the time to report them via our reporting tool.\nYou can read more about how to report a creator or a post here.\nA member of the Trust &amp.\nSafety team will review the report and if our Community Guidelines have been violated, the case manager will contact the creator to let them know that they are outside these guidelines.</p>\n<p>This is a commitment to creators.\nWe know this is your livelihood.\nWe invest heavily in making these decisions as fair and transparent as possible.\nWe always want creators to feel like they have an open line of communication.\nSo how does this translate to moderation? Our first reflex is always to try to educate creators to help them understand how a rule has been broken and how to remedy the issue.\nIn cases where the violation is particularly bad or intentional we may take further action such as suspending or removing their account.\nIn the most extreme cases we may ban a creator from using Patreon.</p>\n<p>Because you are raising funds on Patreon, we may be held accountable for what you do with those funds, so we may also look at what you do with your membership off our platform.\nAs a result when we talk about \"On Patreon,\" it means the creations you are funding on and through Patreon.\nWhen reviewing a page, we look at how creations are shared, where the page is linked to and where the traffic comes from.\nNo matter what happens, we always give creators the opportunity to appeal a decision by contacting us and sending any relevant information they believe was not considered.\nWe may not change our minds, but we will always listen.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Be safe, be respectful, make stuff<p>\n</p>\n<p>These Community Guidelines exist to shape and guide Patreon and the growing number of creators and communities using it.\nThis is not about building an arbitrary framework of \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d It\u2019s about making Patreon a place where diverse creators and their communities feel excited, supported, and happy to exist, while still allowing for different\u2014and sometimes even conflicting\u2014points of view.</p>\n<p>These guidelines summarize a thorough, thoughtful, and living internal policy that we spent time thinking about and defining with guidance from community and safety experts.\nWe\u2019re proud of these guidelines because we believe they will help creators build a safe and supportive environment in which they can continue to create, share and build intimate and lasting relationships with their patrons.</p>\n<p>\n</p>AuthenticityTo summarize: Patreon is for creators who put something original out into the world.\nAs a creator, you may not post creations that infringe on others' intellectual property rights.<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can\u2019t create fake pages or collect money for things you\u2019re not actually doing.\nFor example, you cannot create a fan page for someone else.</li>\n<li>You cannot pretend to be or impersonate someone else by using the name, brand or works of another to deceive patrons.\nWe will review satire and comedy in a different way as we believe these subgenres are original creations.</li>\n<li>You also can\u2019t use Patreon as a prank or to fund non-activity.\nFor example, a Creator cannot collect funds for *not doing* something, such as, I will stop tweeting videos of playing the harmonica badly if I reach $200 per month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you want to read more about our copyright infringement policies, you can find more information in our Copyright and Trademark Policy.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Bullying, harassment, and threatsTo summarize: We don\u2019t allow bullying or harassment because we want Patreon to feel like a safe place for our various communities.\nAt the same time, we want people to be able to express themselves, be critical, and discuss controversial issues.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We recognize that discussing celebrities, media or other public figures can sometimes involve harsh criticism, and we believe that is an appropriate part of free debate.\nHowever, we draw the line when it comes to harassing private figures, or taking any action that might affect people\u2019s physical safety, regardless of whether these people are private or public figures.</p>\n<p>As much as we want you to be able to express yourself, we want all of our users to have the right to express their opinion without feeling intimidated.\nEven the most difficult conversations should take place in the most respectful way.\nHere is how we define these behaviors.</p>\n<p>Bullying and harassment:</p>\n<p>You cannot attempt to intimidate anyone, either directly or by using your influence over others.\nWe treat real-life interactions more seriously than online interactions when analyzing whether a line has been crossed because it can be more threatening and lead to physical violence.\nWhen both sides engage in similar behavior, such as feuds between public figures, we are less likely to take action.</p>\n<p>Threats:</p>\n<p>Anyone on Patreon should be able to express their opinion in a way that doesn't threaten another person.\nIn this respect, we take threats of violence very seriously.\nAny creator or patron threatening the well-being of an individual or group of people will be removed.\nThis includes threatening behavior such as stalking or inciting others to commit violent acts.</p>\n<p>If you are a victim of this behavior and feel that your personal safety is at risk, we suggest you contact your local law enforcement, in addition to reporting the behavior to us.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Hate speechTo summarize: Patreon connects creators to their patrons all over the world.\nWe are a global platform built on promoting creativity, which makes us a very inclusive group.\nTherefore, there is no room on Patreon for projects funding hate speech, such as calling for violence, exclusion, or segregation.\nThis includes serious attacks on people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability or serious medical conditions.<p>\n</p>\n<p>When reviewing an account for a potential hate speech violation, we consider some of the following questions:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do the creations have historical or educational value? For example, we don\u2019t allow the use of the swastika for propaganda and promoting hate, but it would be acceptable to use it in an educational video to talk about Germany under the Third Reich.</li>\n<li>Is there a call for violence against someone based on a characteristic like those listed above?</li>\n<li>Does the creator glorify a group that is known to support ideologies that would be classified as hate speech under this policy?</li>\n<li>Is the creator using racial slurs or negative depictions of someone based on a characteristic like those listed above?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>This list is not exhaustive, but we want to be transparent about how we work in the grey areas between speech and action.\nThere can be a fine line between political comments and hate speech.\nIf you come across what you believe to be hate speech on Patreon, please take the time to report it.</p>\n<p>\n</p>18+ creationsTo summarize: As we strive to create a community that is inclusive and diverse, we want to take into consideration our diverse user base of different ages and sensitivities.\nWe ask creators to flag themselves as 18+ if their creations may be considered inappropriate for people under 18 years of age.\nThis may include nudity or discussion around sexuality.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We realize that the exact age of majority may change depending on where you are, but most places require a certain level of maturity to view these creations and engage in these activities.</p>\n<p>We also require that all public posts on your page be appropriate for all audiences/ages.\nPosts with mature themes must be marked as \u201cPatron Only.\u201d It is important to note that we are not trying to create an arbitrary framework of \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong,\u201d but rather giving people the tools to view only what they feel comfortable with.</p>\n<p>Nudity:</p>\n<p>You can post nude creations on Patreon of both real and fictional subjects.\nPosts with mature themes should be marked as \u201cPatron Only\u201d.\nThis means that you cannot post nudity in public areas including your profile picture, banner, reward images or \u2018about me\u2019 section.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, you should never post or share nude creations of any individual under the age of 18, including yourself.\nAs a strong commitment to child safety, we will work with law enforcement whenever we come across child exploitation material.\nYou can read more about our pornography policy in the next section.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we understand that you may make a mix 18+ creations and other types of creations, and that is okay with us too.\nWe will always review your work within its context.\nHowever, if you have concerns, please let us know and we will provide you with guidance on how to maintain a dual presence.</p>\n<p>Pornography and sexual services:</p>\n<p>We don't allow pornographic material or sexual services on Patreon, which we define as \"real people engaging in sexual acts such as masturbation or sexual intercourse on camera.\" If you want to learn more, please make sure to also consult our Benefit Guidelines.</p>\n<p>Offensive and graphic creations:</p>\n<p>We understand that artists sometimes have to push boundaries to create thought provoking art so we don't review offensive and graphic creations with strict black and white guidelines, instead we review them in the context of the whole creator page.</p>\n<p>However, we have zero tolerance when it comes to the glorification of sexual violence which includes bestiality, rape, and child exploitation (i.e., sexualized depiction of minors).\nThis is true for illustrated, animated, or any other type of creations.\nPatreon reserves the right to review and remove accounts that may violate this guideline.</p>\n<p>We also do not allow other fringe sexual fetish creations, such as incest, necrophilia, or fetish creations that is hard to distinguish from non-consensual sex.</p>\n<p>We understand that some topics on this list such as incest or rape are a little bit more complicated because these situations are, unfortunately, part of real life.\nAs a result, when reviewing these types of creations, the Trust and Safety team will take into consideration context including personal, historical or educational narrative.\nFor example, survivor stories or fiction such as Game of Thrones or Lolita are allowed on Patreon.</p>\n<p>\n</p>DoxingTo summarize: We take a strong stance against doxing, which is sharing an individual\u2019s private information or aggregating their public information for the purpose of intimidating them through harassment.<p>\n</p>\n<p>We take this strong stance against doxing because it is used to silence or intimidate people with different viewpoints on the internet.\nIt can cause extensive emotional trauma, and can put the victim\u2019s physical safety at risk.</p>\n<p>The most classic form of doxing is when an individual\u2019s private personal information is shared.\nThis could be information such as a phone number or home address.\nThe definition of private personal information can vary and may mean that it is simply very difficult to find.</p>\n<p>We also consider it to be doxing when an individual\u2019s non-private information is aggregated.\nFor example, we would consider it doxing if someone\u2019s profile picture was combined with their real name, all of their known social media accounts, and the city they lived in.</p>\n<p>No matter the specific information shared, we also evaluate the context around why it was shared.\nIf it looks like this information is being shared for the purpose of making it easier for a large group to harass that individual, we are likely to consider it doxing.</p>\n<p>When doxing takes place, we lose the ability to have conversations.\nDoxing isn\u2019t speech countering speech, it is speech shutting down others\u2019 ability to speak.\nIt removes our ability to discuss ideas, grow as individuals and have a safe space for disagreement.</p>\n<p>\n</p>People who can\u2019t use patreonTo summarize: Because Patreon empowers people financially, we restrict both the types of media and projects that can be funded on Patreon, and also which people can and cannot receive funds through Patreon.\nAfter creating a Patreon page, any creator caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, malicious doxing, coordinating nonviolent harm (such as fraud, money laundering and gambling), or encouraging others to do any of these activities may be banned from using Patreon.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Politicians:</p>\n<p>You cannot use Patreon to fund your run for office or to fund the political campaigns of others.</p>\n<p>Criminal or Harmful Past:</p>\n<p>Any creator caught in the act or convicted of making credible violent threats, committing violent crimes, child abuse, malicious doxing, coordinating nonviolent harm (such as fraud, money laundering, and gambling), or encouraging others to do any of these activities, may be banned from using Patreon.</p>\n<p>Dangerous Organizations:</p>\n<p>People with a dangerous criminal history or a known affiliation with violent or dangerous groups (including terrorist or cyber terrorist organizations, organized criminal groups, and violent hate groups), cannot receive funds through Patreon, no matter the purpose or apparent intention of their Patreon page.</p>\n<p>You can discuss these groups on Patreon but any creator praising or actively supporting these groups or their leaders won't be allowed on Patreon.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Harmful and illegal activitiesTo summarize: We don\u2019t allow funds to be collected for anything that facilitates harmful or illegal activities.\nYou cannot fund creations that advocate, threaten, or show you causing harm to yourself, other people or animals.\nIn the same way, you cannot promote illegal activities such as property crime, distribution of illegal weapons, or drug manufacturing.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Self-harm:</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t allow any page that promotes or glorifies self-harm, such as pages that encourage self-injury, suicide, or an eating disorder.\nExamples include pages that glorify self-scarification or a pro-anorexia campaign.\nIf we believe there\u2019s a credible risk the creator will harm themselves, we will work with law enforcement when needed.\nHowever, we allow creations that promotes awareness such as self-harm survival stories, especially if they have educational value.</p>\n<p>If you or someone close to you might be in danger of hurting themselves, please contact local authorities or seek help: http://www.suicide.org/suicide-hotlines.html</p>\n<p>Illegal activity:</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t allow pages that collect money for an illegal purpose, or that encourage others to break the law.\nFor example, creators may not promote illegal weapons, drug manufacturing techniques or distribution, or property crime.\nFor example, we don't allow creations that help organize or encourage vandalism.\nNote that we do allow street art.</p>\n<p>Dangerous activities:</p>\n<p>We ask those creators who are posting dangerous stunts to include a clear disclaimer.\nWe also require that these types of posts be marked as \u201cPatron Only\" if it is too graphic or dangerous for a general audience.</p>\n<p>\n</p>SpamTo summarize: While it can be hard to grow a patron base, no one likes being spammed.\nBe creative and original, don\u2019t post repetitive comments or send unwanted private messages to other members of the community.<p>\n</p>\n<p>These are some of the actions we consider to be spamming, which is prohibited on Patreon:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t create pledging schemes.\ndon\u2019t contact other creators to have a pledge-for-a-pledge kind of trade deal.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t use Patreon to release or link to malware or phishing schemes.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t make misleading posts to grow your patronage.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t post comments on other creators\u2019 pages promoting your own page.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t send a large number of unsolicited private messages asking for support.</li>\n<li>Don't use incorrect tagging in order to drive more search results.</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t post multiple paid posts per day if you are a per-post creator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>When reviewing reports about spam, we will distinguish between commercial spam and friendly abuse such as legitimate creators spamming other creators\u2019 pages.\nIf we determine the spam is friendly abuse, the account will be flagged.\nrepeat offenses will lead to full removal of the creator or patron page.\nCommercial spamming by an account that is not a legitimate creator will be removed from Patreon.\nIn other words, be creative and original because nobody likes Spam (not the canned type).</p>\n<p>\n</p>Patron accountsTo summarize: The philosophy behind these guidelines also applies to patrons.\nWhile we believe that creators are best at managing their communities there are some instances when the Trust and Safety team will review reports for patrons' behaviour.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Creators report a patron\u2019s post directly following these instructions.\nIf you would like us to review the behavior of one of your patrons we will keep the review confidential.\nThe Trust and Safety team reviews reports around hate speech, harassment and solicitation very carefully and we will take action against a patron account if we find that they are in clear violation of these guidelines.</p>\n<p>Please remember that we will not share any details related to what kind of action we might have taken against a patron's account.\nMost importantly, if you feel unsafe because a patron is stalking or harassing you, you should always try to seek the help of your local law enforcement and contact the closest cyber crime unit as they will have the most tools and means to help.\nPatreon will work closely with law enforcement when there is an investigation and if a law enforcement agency sends us a subpoena.</p>\n<p>This policy is part of Patreon\u2019s Terms of Use.\nFor more information, contact Patreon at guidelines@patreon.com.\nYou
