Limited Privacy Policy, last updated 9 October 2021<p> Click here for Privacy Policy in German / Klicken Sie hier f\u00fcr die deutschen Datenschutzbestimmungen</p>\n<p>Summary: Dr.\nPanda is committed to making sure that kids\u2019 privacy is safeguarded and we aim to comply with all (privacy) regulations worldwide, like the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the US.If you want to know what data is collected by our apps and how this is handled, please review this policy.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, send us an email via support@drpanda.com, we are here to help.</p>\n<p> When using the apps we produce for parents and children (the \u201cGames\u201d) our company and its subsidiaries (together \u201cDr.\nPanda\u201d or \u201cWe\u201d) may collect information including usage data.When adults or parents visit www.drpanda.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d), we may also collect information on the usage of our website for adults and parents.\nThis data collection is discussed in greater detail below.</p>\n<p>If you are accessing the Games or Website from within the European Union (EU) or are an EU citizen, please review the Lawful Bases for Processing Personal Data and Individual Rights sections below for more information on your how your personal data will be processed and the rights you have regarding this processing.</p>Information collected through our Games<p>Information Collected Automatically By:</p>\n<p>Dr.\nPanda: Most of our apps note your IP address and use this to determine the country the device is located.\nThe IP address is not stored on our systems, but we keep track of the country our app is functioning in.\nThis information cannot be connected to a unique device and is never shared with third parties.</p>\n<p>Our QR enabled apps (the \u201cQR App\u201d) require you to scan a QR code to activate the QR App.\nThe QR code, a regional code (indicating the country the QR App is located) and a random number (generated based on the hardware characteristics of the device the QR App is installed on, but which cannot be used to determine any specifications of this hardware) is forwarded to our servers and stored there.\nThis information is only used to verify the QR App is only functioning on a limited number of devices at the same time and is not shared outside Dr.\nPanda.\nIf you install the QR App on more devices, the first authorization (based on the random number) will be deleted and this will de-authorize the first device to run the QR App.</p>\n<p>Flurry (Yahoo): We used to use this service for analytics, and older versions of our applications may still have the Flurry SDK included in them.\nThe SDK in those apps has since been made inactive and is no longer collecting any data.\n</p>Mixpanel: We use Mixpanel in some of our apps services to get a better understanding of the usage of our apps.\nTo this end our apps collect non-personal data which is sent to Mixpanel and only used to provide us with an overview of the usage of our apps.\nThe information collected by us through Mixpanel is used solely to improve our service and we do not provide this information to any other third party, unless in order to comply with a legal obligation to do so (e.g.\ncourt order) or in case the ownership of the information changes due to a merger, acquisition or restructuring involving Dr.\nPanda Limited.<p>\n</p>\n<p>For more information on Mixpanel please see their privacy policy here: https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy </p>\n<p>Firebase is an attribution tool that lets us know which sites, apps or platforms users of some of our apps may come from.\nThis specific tool is only used in relation to adult users of our apps or sections of our apps targeted at adults (such as subscription purchase areas).</p>\n<p>For more information on Firebase, please see their privacy policy here: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy </p>\n<p>Unity Analytics: Unity technologies makes the software engine for some of our Games.\nIt collects analytical information to better understand your use of our Games and to improve them for you.\nUnity does not share any personal information with other third parties.\nUnity will use the collected information only in anonymized form for their own products.</p>\n<p>For more information on Unity please see the privacy policy here: http://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy, and for more information on the exact data collected you can refer to the appendix below.</p>\n<p>Sensorsdata: We use Sensorsdata in some of our apps to get a better understanding of the usage of our apps.\nTo this end, our apps use Sensorsdata to collect data which is collected, sent to and stored on our own servers only.\nIf a user is logged in with a Dr.\nPanda Account, we may link certain app usage information collected by Sensorsdata, such as which activities have been completed by a user, so we can inform parents of their child\u2019s progress and usage in an app.\nOther information collected by us through Sensorsdata is used solely to improve our service and we do not provide this information to any other third party, unless in order to comply with a legal obligation to do so (e.g.\ncourt order) or in case the ownership of the information changes due to a merger, acquisition or restructuring involving Dr.\nPanda Limited.</p>\n<p>For more information on Sensorsdata, see their privacy policy here: https://manual.sensorsdata.cn/sa/latest/tech_sdk_client_privacy_policy_english-22256010.html</p>\n<p>Appsflyer is
