the Society may ask for additional Identity Information including, race, gender, and ethnicity, but providing this information is optional (this varies based on the application).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When a User makes a donation or gift membership, become a member or renews a membership, the process requires that User to complete a credit card transaction in which additional information will be needed (i.e., card type, number, security code and expiration date).\nCredit card payment processing is handled by a Third Party and neither the Society nor this Third Party stores any credit card information.\n(See \u201cProcessing Information\u201d section below)</p>\n<p>To post comments on Society Websites, Users must register with and provide personal information to a Third-Party provider.\nThe personal information provided to the Third-Party provider is governed by Disqus,&nbsp;https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy.</p>\n<p>The following guidelines set forth the Society\u2019s practices for handling your personal information in more detail:</p> a.\nEducation Program Applicants, Entrants, Volunteers, Teachers, Finalists, Observers, and Guests <p>The Society currently administers programs that typically engage students ages 13 and older.\nAny student providing information as part of an application, whether or not selected for a program, will have their information used for consideration of entry to the program and to send communications about the applied-for program and other Society programs, membership and publications.</p>\n<p>Applicants selected to participate in a Society program will have their applicant information transferred to an Alumni Database following program participation.\nCertain information, including name, school, hometown, competition and year of participation, competition abstract and any awards won, may be automatically published in several Society public-facing Websites.\nSome individuals will be able to claim their profiles by registering with the Society and upon registration, edit their profiles, upload photos and provide additional information, all in accordance with the Society\u2019s Terms of Use.\nThose individuals also may be contacted by the Society\u2019s alumni program staff for participation in additional alumni activities and the Society may also contact alumni regarding other the Society programs, membership and publications.</p>\n<p>All other participants (non-applicants) that engage with our Education Programs (i.e.\neducators, volunteers, judges, etc.) are asked to provide personal information that identifies them.\nSuch information may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, phone number, or email address.\n&nbsp;</p> b.\nSubscribers, Members, Donors, \u201cFriends\u201d and Other Commercial Activity <p>Many individuals provide information in order to volunteer with the Society, receive the Society Newsletter, the&nbsp;<em>Science News</em>&nbsp;daily/weekly email newsletter, the&nbsp;<em>Science News for Students</em>&nbsp;email newsletter or otherwise participate in or learn more about the Society programs and publications.\nFor example, Users may be prompted for address information in order to subscribe to the Society\u2019s publications, including, but not limited to,&nbsp;<em>Science News</em>&nbsp;and the Society newsletter.\nAddresses and other personally identifiable information will be stored as necessary to process and fulfill an individual\u2019s gift, membership, subscription or other commercial transaction.\nThe Society may send solicitation and/or subscription offers along with these communications, subject to a User\u2019s opt-out selection described below.\nThis information may also be shared with other programs and publications of the Society or as otherwise described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>From time to time, the Society may rent subscriber information to Third Party organizations.\nIf Users would like to be removed from such lists, see section 9 below for more information.</p> c.\nE-mail Communications and Opt-Out Preferences <p>The Society sends e-mail communications to current and past members, program participants, volunteers, subscribers, digital badge earners and other individuals or organizations upon request.\nEvery bulk e-mail includes an \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link that allows the recipient to decline all future email communication from the Society.\nRemoval from all lists may take up to five business days to complete.\nReplying directly to the email, rather than using the unsubscribe form, may require additional time to process.</p>\n<p>The only instance where an \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link would not be included at the bottom of an e-mail sent as direct correspondence from a Society staff person.\nPlease respond directly back to that individual staff person if you would prefer to be removed from future communications of that type or all types.</p> d.\nInternal Uses <p>The information that the Society collects is generally used for internal purposes such as processing donations, providing our publications and services and fulfilling requests for information.\nThe Society may also collect information about Website Users in order to assist in determining which parts of the Websites visitors find most valuable.\nThis allows the Society to continually improve the services it provides.\n&nbsp;For example, the Society may track the URL that a User visited before coming to a Society Website.\nAdditionally, the Society may track Users\u2019 IP addresses and use Users\u2019 IP addresses to help diagnose problems with the Society\u2019s servers and to administer the Websites.&nbsp;</p> 6.\nSecurity <p>The Society protects data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access.\nSome of the safeguards we use are data encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls.\nTherefore, the security mechanisms used to protect data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection against abuse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encryption to protect the connection between the Society\u2019s Websites and a browser.\nWe have additional and comprehensive security measures in place when a User accesses the Society\u2019s Websites by implementing a multilayer security approach for protection as well as firewalls to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For confidentiality and security, we use IDs and passwords to secure personal information.\nIt is important for Users to protect their ID, password, and any personal information.\nUsers should not disclose personal information (especially passwords) to anyone.\nWhen a User is finished using our services, they should log out from their account.\nIf a User shares their computer, whether in a public or private setting, the User should sign off and close the browser when finished.</p> 7.\nCookies or Other Tracking Technology <p>A cookie is a small data file that is written to a computer\u2019s hard drive or mobile device by the web browser.\nA cookie file can contain and/or automatically collect information, such as a user identification code or IP address that a website will use to track the pages and number of times a User has visited.\nThe data read from these cookies may be linked to personally identifying and non-personally identifying information.\nThird party cookies enable Third Party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Website (e.g.\nadvertising, videos and website analytics services).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Users may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a \u201cpersistent\u201d cookie and rather accept only a \u201cper-session\u201d cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the Society\u2019s Websites to enjoy the Websites\u2019 full benefits.\nIf the User declines the attachment of any cookie, the User may not have access to the full benefits of the Website.\nRegistration enables the Websites to better determine a User\u2019s interest areas and provide the most relevant information.</p>\n<p>The Society may also use web beacons, clear gif technology, action tags or other technologies to collect aggregate website visitation data by tracking how Users navigate to and through the Websites.\nWe also include web beacons in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been delivered or opened.\nWeb beacons cannot be declined when delivered using a regular web page, but they can be refused when delivered by e-mail.\nIf a User does not wish to receive web beacons by email, they will need to disable HTML images or select text only for emails received with their email software.</p>\n<p>Some web browsers may transmit \u201cdo not track\u201d signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.\nThere is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals.\nThe Society does not currently take action in response to these signals.\nWe may revise this Privacy Policy if and when we establish a standard for responding to these signals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may use a web analytics service such as Google Analytics, New Relic, and HotJar to record and analyze activity on our Websites.\n&nbsp;These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help the Society understand how our Websites are used, the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, or to help us customize our Websites and applications in order to enhance the user experience.\nThe Websites or any such service may track browsing across web sites that use the same service, may collect statistical data and/or IP address.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Website\u2019s web and ad servers log information about a User\u2019s IP address, browser type and the current URL the User is requesting.\nThis information is always provided by a User\u2019s browser and automatically logged by most websites.\nThese log files are stored in a secure location and used in our internal analysis of traffic patterns within our Websites.</p>\n<p>Our Websites interface with social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter and may include social media features such as the Facebook \u201clike\u201d button, widgets or interactive mini-programs that run on our Websites.\nThese features may collect a User\u2019s IP address, screen resolution, browser type, browsing information, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nIf a User is member of a social media site, the features may allow the social media site to connect the User\u2019s visit to our Websites with the User\u2019s personal information.\nUser\u2019s interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the party providing the features.</p>\n<p>For more information about the cookies the Society uses, please see our separate Cookie Policy at&nbsp;https://www.societyforscience.org/cookie-policy.</p> 8.\nEEA Individuals: Marketing and Third-Party Sharing <p>This section applies to EEA individuals

and publications offered by the Society or select Third-Parties, including sponsors and their advertising and public relations agencies.\nThe Society may also share information with its sponsors and their advertising and public relations agencies.\nThese Third Parties may have their own opt-out options in which you will be able to directly opt-out.\nOtherwise you can opt-out by contacting the Society.</p>\n<p>From time to time, the Society may rent subscriber information to Third Party organizations.\nThe Society closely reviews every request for information by Third-Parties to help ensure they are trustworthy and reputable, as determined by the Society in its discretion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we strive to ensure that any such parties will provide at least the same level of protection as this Privacy Policy offers, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of Third Parties and do not guarantee that these Third Parties have similar privacy practices.</p>\n<p>A User may opt-out of such sharing with Third-Party organizations or modify communication preferences at any time by e-mailing privacy@societyforscience.org, by calling (202) 785-2255 or by mailing Society for Science

Holders/Registrants: To Access or Correct Your Information</strong>\n<p>Users who have an account or have registered with any of the Websites may view, correct or update the personal information we have by accessing and changing their personal information via a User account login or sending a request to privacy@societyforscience.org.\nIt is important that the data we have about our Users is accurate and up to date.\nIn the event a User\u2019s information changes, the Society asks that the User please notify us so that we can update our records.\nEEA individuals have additional rights as stated in this Privacy Policy.</p> 14.\nData Retention&nbsp.\n<p>We will retain the information provided to us and information automatically collected through the Websites for as long as a User account or membership is active or as needed to provide our publications and services for a reasonable time thereafter.\nUser\u2019s personal information will remain in the Alumni Network indefinitely unless Users\u2019 instruct the Society to delete their profiles or otherwise opt-out.\nWe will retain and use Users\u2019 information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.\nAt any time, we may store non-personal information in the aggregate.\nIf a User is an EEA individual, the User may request that the Society deletes certain personal data, as explained in Section 16 below.</p>\n<strong>15.\n</strong>Minors<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>Minors under the age of 18 may request and obtain removal of certain content or information posted on our Websites by sending an email to privacy@societyforscience.org.\n&nbsp;Please be advised that our removal of your post(s) does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of

information required to participate in our programs.\nAdditional information will be required at such times to confirm the data that has been submitted by the User or on the User\u2019s behalf.</p> 16.\nEEA Individuals&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>a.\nLegal Rights.</strong>&nbsp;Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d).\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal data the Society holds about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>\n<li>Request correction of the personal data that the Society holds about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>\n<li>Request erasure of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask the Society to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons for which you will receive a notification, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>\n<li>Object to processing of your personal data on the grounds that the Society relies on a legitimate interest (or those of a Third Party) that you feel impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object to the Society processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>\n<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask the Society to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy.\n(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nor (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>\n<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a Third Party.\nThe Society will provide to you, or a Third Party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>\n<li>Withdraw consent at any time where the Society relies on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>b.\nWhat We May Need From You.</strong>&nbsp;The Society may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>c.\nTime Limit to Respond.</strong>&nbsp;The Society tries to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>d.\nInternational Transfers.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Society processes your data in the United States.\nIf we transfer your data to a Third Party outside the European Economic Area (EEA) we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.\nFor further details, see&nbsp;<em>European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</em>.\nAlternatively, we may transfer data to a Third Party if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires the Third Party to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the United States.\nFor further details, see&nbsp;<em>European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</em>.</p>\n<p>Please contact the Privacy Officer if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by the Society when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>e.\nRight to Lodge a Complaint.</strong>&nbsp;In the event of a dispute regarding your rights hereunder, you may have the right to make a complaint with your local authorities.\nThe Society would, however, request a chance to address your concerns first because your privacy is important to us.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-05-18 06:00:25.349008", "updated_at":
