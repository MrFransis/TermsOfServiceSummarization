our entire policy, see below.</p>1.\nWhat Data Does Foursquare CollectData You Provide To Us:<p>We collect data that you provide to us when you create an account, such as full name, email address, phone number, birthday, gender, the city in which you created your account, and, where applicable, your social media username and other data if you create an account using third party log-in credentials (please see \u201cData Received From Third Parties\u201d below).</p>\n<p>We may also collect other data you provide when you use the Consumer Services, including pictures you upload, messages you send through the Apps, searches, likes, follows, check-ins, tips, survey responses, demographic information, and any other data that you voluntarily provide to us.</p>Data Collected Automatically When You Use Our Consumer Services:<p>If you opt in to sharing your location with us, we automatically receive data about your precise location (e.g., latitude-longitude coordinates) whenever you use the Consumer Services (e.g.\nopen our mobile apps, visit our website, etc.).\nIf you opt in to have background location on in our Apps, we will collect data about your location when you are not using the Apps and when the Apps are closed (as permitted by your device settings).</p>\n<p>We also collect additional data about you when you use the Consumer Services.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>data about how you interact with the Consumer Services, such as your search words, page views, date and time of interactions, time spent on each page, or posts you make;</li>\n<li>device information, such as your hardware model, operating system and version, unique ID and device data such as device identifiers, IP address, sensor data, browser type, language,

Foursquare account, we combine data collected while you were not logged in.</p>\n<p>Some features and functionality in our Apps require that you provide your location.\nIf you have location services turned on, whenever you use our Apps on your mobile device, we collect and use your geocoordinates (e.g.\nlatitude and longitude) to tailor the Consumer Services to your current location.\nWe will only process your location with your express permission.\nIf you have persistent background location turned on, we will obtain your device\u2019s location even if you are not using the Apps.\nYour location is never shared with others, except with your consent or as permitted under this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We use various technologies to determine your precise location, such as the location services of your operating system or browser, sensor data from your device (e.g.\nmagnetometer, barometer, gyroscopes, accelerometers, compasses, Bluetooth data, beacon data, Wi-Fi access points, GPS data, and cell tower data), and other data that may help us understand your precise location.</p>\n<p>If you have opted-in to sharing your background location with us in our Apps, you may remove your permission at any time by going into your operating device settings and toggling off background sharing.</p>\n<p>We also use your data to improve the Consumer Services and our business, conduct research and development, perform analytics, develop and offer new products and service, and to infer certain details about you, including details about you, your interests and whether separate devices (e.g.\nmobile phones, tablets, and/or TVs) are owned by you or by members of your household.\nFor example, we may customize the Consumer Services to allow you to add friends from your device\u2019s contact list who are also using the Consumer Services or, if applicable, your Facebook, Google or Twitter account, if you have opted to connect these accounts to your Foursquare accounts).\nWe do not store your contact lists.\nAs another example, we also use your data to help us map Locations (as defined below).\nFor example, we may use device signals to determine that a particular device is within a particular venue.\nAdditionally, if you consent to sharing crash data (when the Apps crash) with us, we may use that data to help us analyze the cause of the crash and improve the Consumer Services.</p>Communicate With You<p>We use your data to communicate with you by email, text (if you opt-in), or in our Apps, about new product offerings, updates to the Consumer

advertisements that are tailored to your interests.\nThe data collected for this purpose includes data about how you interact with the Consumer Services or with unaffiliated websites and apps, device data, and data from cookies, pixels or other similar technologies.</p>\n<p>We combine the data described above with demographic data, location and other interest-based segment data obtained from third parties, including data obtained from the Enterprise Services to provide our Products.</p>3.\nWhen Is My Data Shared?<p>We may share certain data about you as further described in this Consumer

requirements.</p>\n<p>In addition, when we partner with a business, we may share your mobile advertising identifier or another identifier, and other data such as inferred visits to public locations (such as a store or a restaurant) or as a part of a chain of inferred visits (such as this device went to John\u2019s Coffee Store, then Sarah\u2019s Yoga Studio, and then after, Jenny\u2019s Juice

location.\nWe may also assist our business partners in combining the data we obtain when you use the Consumer Services with the data we receive from those business partners about online or offline

purposes.</p>Data That May Be Shared With Our Affiliates and Subsidiaries<p>We may share data with our affiliates and subsidiaries in order to improve the Consumer Services, develop and offer our

below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Access:</strong> You have the right to request, twice in a 12-month period, that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you during the past 12 months.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Deletion:</strong> You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt-Out of Sale:</strong> You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How to Submit a Request.</strong> To submit an access or deletion request, please log into your Foursquare account or call us at (855)-505-8916.</p>\n<p>To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, click here or email us at privacy@foursquare.com.</p>\n<p>You must provide us with your device identifier, which we will use to fulfill your opt-out request.\nIf you do not know your device identifier, below are instructions on how to locate it.\nWe will not use the information you provide as part of your request for any purpose other than to fulfill your opt-out request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use an iOS operating system, a third-party application is required to locate your Apple IDFA.\nPlease note that we do not control such third-party tools and are not responsible for their content, their privacy policies, or their use of your personal information.</li>\n<li>If you use an Android operating system, open the Google Settings app on your Android device and select \u201cAds.\u201d Your Advertising Identifier should be listed at the bottom of the screen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To submit a request as an authorized agent on behalf of a consumer, please send us a notarized power of attorney and/or other legal

policies and practices, please contact us as described in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section of our Enterprise Services Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Verifying Requests.</strong> To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take&nbsp;steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request.\nIf you have an account with us, we are unable to fulfill your access or deletion requests at this time because there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by California law.\nThe reason for this is that Foursquare historically has not linked IP addresses, device identifiers or other information collected through automated means to named actual persons unless the individual uses the Consumer Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional Information.</strong> If you choose to exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, you have the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by us.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00c0

To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your personal information or complying with your request. If you have an account with us, we are unable to fulfill your access or deletion requests at this time because there is no reasonable method by which we can verify your identity to the level of certainty required by California law.
