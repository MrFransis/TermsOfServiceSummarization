Associated Services (hereafter named as solely the Product), detail policies concerning the obtention and the regulation of access to the Product, and specify our privacy policy.\nThis document was specifically written to create a fair balance of responsibility, freedom of use and peace of mind for both Synapse Softworks LLC, its staff, and the Client.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you have purchased the Product before March 11, 2020, it is in your best interest to reread this document in its entirety.\nMajor changes were implemented and many clauses were either added or removed.\nTo guarantee your compliance with our updated terms and conditions, we highly suggest you go over this document again.</p>DEFINITIONS<ul>\n<li>Product&nbsp;\u2192 The commercial software and scripting utility titled Synapse X.</li>\n<li>Computer, Device&nbsp;\u2192 A physical machine capable of running the Product and its associated utilities.\nVirtual machines and cloud computers are excluded.</li>\n<li>The Staff&nbsp;\u2192 Individuals at the helm of the Synapse X communities, and responsible for managing Whitelists and Blacklists as the Licensing managers.\nWhile sanctioned by Synapse Softworks LLC for their management of their respective communities, they are officially distinct from Synapse Softworks LLC and constitute their own independent self-organized entity collectively defined as the staff team.</li>\n<li>License, Contract, Whitelist&nbsp;\u2192 The formal authorization to use Synapse X and participate in its related communities bought when purchasing a key to the Product.\n</li>\n<li>Blacklist&nbsp;\u2192 The dismissal of a Whitelist, or the action of dismissing a Whitelist.</li>\n<li>Licensing manager&nbsp;\u2192 An individual capable of managing Whitelists and Blacklists, frequently as part of Synapse Softworks LLC or the staff team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>1.\nLICENSING AND PRODUCT INFORMATION<ol>\n<li>The Product in and of itself is an extensible Lua 5.1 programming engine crafted to be interoperable with third party software that similarly runs Lua or Lua-inspired scripting languages.\nMore specifically, the Product is software that aims to make use of third party application programming interfaces (APIs) to achieve full interoperability between the Product\u2019s Lua scripting language and third party applications\u2019 Lua scripting languages (or subsets thereof).\nIn accordance with the philosophy of the GNU Project, we believe that software should be free, free as in Freedom and not price, allowing its users to make use of software as they see fit, and this Product aims to increase the relative liberty and accessibility of Lua scripting engines commonly found in software as a way to practice the philosophy of the GNU Project.\nInteroperability and compatibility is however not guaranteed, as our Product is not necessarily compatible with all third party software.\nThis interoperability, and therefore the nature of this software, is legally protected in the United States by Section 103(f) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (17 USC \u00a7 1201 (f)).</li>\n<li>This license serves as an unlimited contract between you, the Client, and Synapse Softworks LLC.\nBy purchasing a copy of the Product, you implicitly agree to all the conditions, clauses and other information offered by this document, &nbsp;vow to respect it, and uphold the personal responsibility of regularly consulting this document for any changes that may impact your usage of the Product and your behavior towards it.\nYou also affirm that you are aged 13 years or older, as this product is not recommended to individuals under the age of 13.\n</li>\n<li>Regulation of licensing, such as the granting or dismissing of licenses, is the responsibility of both Synapse Softworks LLC and its community managers (the staff).\nCompliance with either group\u2019s orders is highly recommended if you happen to breach the terms of conditions of this contract, as it may save your license.\nThese two groups will hereafter be named the Licensing managers.</li>\n<li>Breaching the terms and conditions of this license will inevitably result in the immediate termination of the contract and therefore the ceasing of your personal usage of the Product, unless the Licensing managers grants you leniency.</li>\n<li>Licensing managers have the right to revoke your contract at will and without warning.\nLicensing managers are expected to issue dismissals with justification found in the terms and conditions, unless in extraordinary circumstances.\nHowever, in case you judge your contract dismissal to be unfair, you may appeal your dismissal to Licensing managers and seek a possible reversal.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Unless specifically forbidden by Licensing managers, it is in your right to repurchase a license if it has been previously terminated in most cases.\nHowever, it is a Licensing manager\u2019s right to decide to revoke a newly purchased license for offenses committed under a previous license if they have been severe enough or are repeated under the new license.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Licenses are not individually transferable, and any attempt to force an illegal transfer whether of its commerciality is forbidden.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Licenses may be shared between individuals of the same household and/or between individual devices connected on the same network.\nFor example, family members living in the same domicile may share a copy of the Product insofar they are not sharing it to anyone not connected to their home network.</li>\n<li>The household-share rule does not apply to non-residential networks.\nFor example, you cannot share a single copy of the product to individuals connected to a business/commercial network.</li>\n<li>If the Licensing managers doubt the legitimacy of your sharing, they have the right to investigate your sharing of the Product and revoke your license if it is deemed unauthorized under the Terms of Service.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Licenses are not resellable, and any attempt to illegitimately resell a license will be considered an illegal transfer as defined by section 1.6.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The only exception are Licenses transferred&nbsp;through authorized giveaways by Synapse Softworks LLC and its affiliates.\nthey are allowed to be sold.\nProof that the key originates from an authorized giveaway must be provided if administrators question the sale.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Licenses are to be considered irrevocably paid unless Synapse Softworks LLC decides that your condition warrants a partial refund.\nThere are no conditions for guaranteed refunds.</li>\n<li>All claims and disputes arising under or relating to this License are to be settled by binding arbitration in a location mutually agreeable to the parties.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted on a confidential basis pursuant to the arbitration rules and guidelines of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.\nAny decision or award as a result of any such arbitration proceeding shall be in writing and shall provide an explanation for all conclusions of law and fact and shall include the assessment of costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees.\nAny such arbitration shall be conducted by an arbitrator experienced in computer science and software distribution and shall include a written record of the arbitration hearing.\nThe parties reserve the right to object to any individual who shall be employed by or affiliated with a competing organization or entity.\nAn award of arbitration may be confirmed in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nPlease bear in mind that as expressed by Amendment VII of the United States Constitution, if you were to bypass our arbitration clause as an American citizen, you do not have legal grounds to file a lawsuit for a civil trial as the total value of our products never exceed the amount of $20 American Dollars (USD).</li>\n<li>THE &nbsp;PRODUCT &nbsp;PROVIDER &nbsp;AND &nbsp;OUR

Softworks LLC includes your Feedback in them.</li>\n<li>Any appeal attempting to reverse punishment(s) that have resulted in license revocation must be filed within one month of the date of such punishment being issued at https://synapsesupport.io.\nAny attempts to file an appeal seeking to reverse the punishment after one month has passed since the punishment(s) issue date will be permanently voided and denied (regardless of its validity), unless otherwise stated by Licensing managers.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Any appeal attempting to reverse punishment(s) received for infringing the rules and guidelines detailed under Article 6 and Article 7 (but has NOT resulted in license revocation) must be filed within six months of the date of such punishment being issued at

rules and guidelines detailed within the two aforementioned sections will result in restrictions of your permissions to participate in or otherwise access official communication channels.\nInfringements deemed severe enough may result in further penalties, such as preventing your access to these channels altogether or revoking your license.\nThe punishment necessary is up to the discretion of the Licensing managers.</li>\n<li>You may appeal any punishment received for infringing the rules and guidelines detailed under Article 6 and Article 7 (\u201cCommunications\u201d), but relief from moderation isn\u2019t guaranteed no matter the circumstance or severity of the infringement.\nSuch appeal must be in accordance with \u00a75.4 and/or \u00a75.4a in order to be considered valid.</li>\n<li>Any references to the \u201cserver\u201d or the \u201cDiscord\u201d in Article 7 are to be interpreted as referring to official communication channels in general.\nAny reference to the phrases \u201cblacklist\u201d or \u201clicense revocation\u201d&nbsp;in Article 7 are to be interpreted as referring to the immediate termination of the contract and therefore the ceasing of your personal usage of the Product.</li>\n<li>Any Communications section or individual rule that contains a marked superscript is considered to have a preordained punishment for infringing such section rule(s) or individual rule(s).\nSub-section rules that have extra superscripts in addition to the main section superscript(s) are considered to have said superscripts as possible additional&nbsp;punishment.\nHowever, in accordance with Article \u00a76.2, Licensing managers reserve the right to bestow any additional punishment at their discretion.\nThe superscript legend is as follows (in order of lowest to highest severity): 1-server mute, 2-server kick, 3-voice channels ban, 4-developer channels ban, 5-server ban, and 6-Product license revocation.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>7.\nCOMMUNICATIONS<ol>\n<li>Freedom to voice your opinions and speak your mind is considered the golden rule of the Synapse X community and is what sets it apart from

any freedom, it comes with its own limits.\nYour freedom of speech ends when it could potentially harm someone else physically, their computer, or if it impedes another person\u2019s right to speak as well.\nUse common sense when applying this rule.</li>\n<li>Do not spam, flood or otherwise prevent normal communications from occurring.\nThis includes unnecessarily tagging individuals, posting ASCII art that does not contribute to ongoing conversations, or posting fake Nitro codes.\nAdditionally, in order to promote fluidity in communications, avoid speaking piecemeal.1</li>\n<li>We don't allow

days.1</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>If the content posted is in violation of \u00a77.3, then the punishment of violating \u00a77.3 will supersede any punishment for violating \u00a77.3.2.5</li>\n<li>Further violations of \u00a77.3.2 will result in you being banned from the server.5</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>The usage of bots, including self-bots or plugins that simulate the usage of self-bots (e.g.\nautomation of Discord features), is not permitted.\nThis may get you banned from the server and possibly from the platform altogether.5</li>\n<li>Do not attempt (using various methods)&nbsp;to identify or post personal information of any user here.\nThis includes IP addresses, real names, or other personal information that could harm another user.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Attempting or threatening to obtain another Client\u2019s personal information will result in a server ban.5</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Scripts that are posted in the scripts-channel part of the server are not subject to \u00a77.5 and \u00a77.5.1, but must be in accordance with \u00a77.22.1.5.</li>\n<li>Multiple violations of \u00a77.5.1 deemed severe enough may result in your Product license being irrevocably revoked.6</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Releasing, harming, or threatening to do either to another Client\u2019s personal information will result in your Product license being irrevocably revoked.6</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Posting any executable file, IP address, phone number (depends on intention &amp.\nhow \u2018public\u2019 the number is [which will be handled on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis]), address, etc.\nwill get you banned, or muted for 1 day if they aren't real.\nThis does not count if they're obviously fake, like 127.0.0.1 or 8.8.8.8.1, 5</li>\n<li>Do not post content that could trigger epileptic seizures or render someone with a mental illness (such as, but not limited to, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) uncomfortable.\nDoing so will result in a ban from the server.5</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Discord account custom statuses and profile pictures are subject to \u00a77.7.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>All NSFW content must be posted in NSFW marked

also get you banned.5</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Tricking other members into posting something that could get them punished is not allowed, and will get you muted/banned depending on the situation.1, 5</li>\n<li>Posting discord crashers / fake crash scripts will get you banned.5</li>\n<li>Nitro Boosters with the capacity to speak in general should not post unfunny memes.\nIf this rule is
