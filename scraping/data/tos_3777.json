provide through our Linktree Services, certain information is collected from your browser.\nThis information is collected as statistical information and may include the IP address, browser type, language and access times.\nThis website also uses cookies to track pages visited and information accessed within our website.\nThis information is for statistical reference, site analysis and to remember your details and preferences when you return to that website.</p>\n<p>(b) In many cases, the tools used on our website record information in a way that does not identify you as an individual.\nIn other cases, information may be personal information in which case this Privacy Policy will apply.</p>\n<p>(c) Below we summarise why we use cookies and the different types that we use:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Necessary cookies</b>: are those that are essential to run our website or to enable you to receive a service that you have requested.\nFor example, to operate a Users\u2019 session or any other request type functionality on the Service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Performance cookies</b>: are those that collect information about how visitors use and interact with our website so that we can improve it.\nFor example, we use Heap Analytics to track anonymous information about how visitors use our Service.\nThis only collects statistical information such as the number of visitors to the Service, how they arrived there (i.e.\nvia a Google search or another website), whether it is a first-time or return visit, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Functionality cookies</b>: are those that remember the choices you make.\nWithout these cookies you may find that certain features are less convenient and reliable.\nFor example, we use these to remember your language and country of choice and to present relevant content or collect statistical information for our User analytics.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Marketing cookies</b>: are those that help us deliver advertising that is more relevant to you and your interests.\nThey include third party cookies placed by our partners and other advertisers who share cookie data with us.\nFor example, we use
