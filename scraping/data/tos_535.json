Publishers receive from\nTransactions which shall be calculated on the gross revenue from the\nTransactions, not including any Transactions for which Publisher or Company\nprovides a refund in

Company will direct users to the Publisher to first try to resolve such\nissues.\nTo request a refund, please contact support with your\npurchase information.\nFor content selling third party external keys (e.g.\nSteam\nkeys), Company may require the Publisher to confirm cancellation of the key\nbefore a refund can be processed due to the Company\u2019s inability to disable\naccess.\nSome

months contact support.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Publisher accounts receiving Payouts from the Company are subject to a\nmaintenance fee for unclaimed transactions.\nPayouts from the Company are\nissued

expressing their intent to claim at a determined time in\nthe future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In simple English, this means that after 1 year, if you haven\u2019t initiated a\npayout for the earnings of a purchase, 10% of it will be debited from your\naccount per month.\nAfter 10 months you will no longer be able to claim any of\nthat purchase.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The maintenance charge will not cause your account balance to become negative\nand will not cause you to owe money to the Company.</p>\n<p>Publisher accounts with purchases initiated before the publish date of this\nclause (May 24,
