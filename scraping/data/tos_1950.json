Inc.\n(collectively with any subsidiaries, \u2018Chegg\u2019), \u2018we\u2019, \u2018us\u2019, and \u2018ours\u2019) use cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our website at www.citationmachine.net (\u201cWebsite\u201d).\nIt explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.\nSome capitalised terms are defined in our&nbsp;Privacy Notice</p>\nWhat are cookies?\n<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.\nCookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.\nLike all e-commerce sites Chegg uses cookies, log files or similar technologies to track usage of our Services.\nLog files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage Information.</p>\n<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Chegg) are called \u201cfirst party cookies\u201d.\nCookies set by parties other than the website owner are called \u201cthird party cookies\u201d.\nThird party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g.\nto make it easier for you to use our Services and place orders, targeted advertising, interactive content and analytics).\nThe parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>\n<p>Some cookies we use are \u201cpersistent\u201d.\nIf you do not log out of your account, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Services.\nWe also use \u201csession\u201d cookies, which are used to identify a particular visit.\nSession cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>\nWhy do we use cookies?\n<p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons.\nSome cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d cookies.\nOther cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites.\nThird parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.\nThis is described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of each cookie category (except strictly necessary cookies) by clicking on the \u201ccookie settings\u201d button below:</p>\n<p>Manage PreferencesThe specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they perform are described below.</p>\nTypes of cookie\nEssential website cookies\n<p>These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Websites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.</p>\nPerformance and functionality cookies:\n<p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Websites but are non-essential to their use.\nHowever, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>\nAnalytics and customisation cookies:\n<p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Websites are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customise our Websites for you.</p>\nAdvertising cookies:\n<p>These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you.\nThey perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.</p>\nSocial networking cookies:\n<p>These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Websites through third party social networking and other websites.\nThese cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.</p>\nWhat about other tracking technologies, like web beacons or embedded scripts?\n<p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.\nWe as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called \u201ctracking pixels\u201d or \u201cclear gifs\u201d).\nThese are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Website and track their online movements for our affiliate program.\nThis allows us to monitor the traffic patterns of users within our Website, to understand whether you have come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website and help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services.\nWe tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers\u2019 Personal Information.\nIn many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>\n<p>An Embedded Script: is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on.\nThe code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.</p>\nDo you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?\n<p>Our Websites also use so-called \u201cFlash Cookies\u201d (also known as Local Shared Objects or \u201cLSOs\u201d) such as HTML5 to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations.\nThird parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs to collect and store information.</p>\n<p>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the&nbsp;Website Storage Settings Panel.\nYou can also control Flash Cookies by going to the&nbsp;Global Storage Settings Panel&nbsp;and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to \u201cinformation\u201d on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>\n<p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.</p>\nWhat about Do Not Track?\n<p>Please note that your browser setting may allow you to automatically transmit a \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 signal to web sites and online service you visit.\nThere is no consensus among industry participants as to what \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 means in this context.\nLike many web sites and online services, Chegg does not alter its practices when it receives a \u2018Do Not Track\u2019 signal from a visitor\u2019s browser.\nTo find out more about \u2018Do Not Track\u2019, please visit&nbsp;https://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>\nDo you serve targeted advertising?\n<p>Chegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors for advertising and analytics services.\nThe advertisements you see will be served by one or more third parties, who use information collected over time about your activities on the Services, and other websites, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nThey may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.\nThis can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you.</p>\n<p>Chegg shares non-Personal Information: de-identified (including hashed) information, location information, demographic information, and Usage Information with these third parties.\nThe information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details.</p>\nHow can I control cookies?\n<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.\nYou can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided via the Cookie Settings button above.</p>\n<p>You can set or amend your web browser (e.g.\nInternet Explorer, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox) controls to accept or refuse cookies.\nIf you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted.\nAs the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser\u2019s help menu for more information.</p>\n<p>In addition, most advertising networks participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of targeted advertising.\nIf you would like to find out more information, please visit&nbsp;https://www.aboutads.info/choices/&nbsp;or&nbsp;https://www.youronlinechoices.com&nbsp;or&nbsp;https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>\nMobile Use\n<p>If you use the Services through a mobile device or one of our mobile applications, we will collect Usage Information.\nYou can turn off the collection of precise location information through your Device settings.\nWe could still infer your approximate location through other information we collect, such as IP address.</p>\nWhere can I get further information?\n<p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at&nbsp;privacy@chegg.com.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-03-08 21:43:44.372604", "updated_at": "2021-03-23 12:36:57.719347"}, {"id": 4270, "name":

in our sole discretion, to make changes to or discontinue any of the Services at any time.\nAny description of the Services provided by Chegg is not a representation that the Services are working or will always work in that manner, as Chegg is continuously updating the Services, and these updates may not always be reflected in the Terms of Use.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Use</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Services may offer features and services that are available to you via your mobile device.\nThese features and services may include, without limitation, the ability to upload content to the Services, receive messages from the Services, download applications to your mobile phone or access features from the Services (collectively, the \"<strong>Mobile Features</strong>\").\nWe may charge for Mobile Features and these charges will be disclosed prior to completion of registration for the Mobile Feature.\nAlso, standard messaging, data and other fees may be charged by your carrier.\nCarrier fees and charges will appear on your mobile bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance.\nYour carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Mobile Features and certain Mobile Features may be incompatible with your carrier or mobile device.\nContact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.</p>\n<p>If you change or terminate your mobile account, you agree to promptly update your Chegg account information so that any messages or notices from Chegg regarding the Services are sent to you and not to the person who is assigned your old number.</p>\n<p>For any of our mobile apps, you agree that the third-party store or platform through which our apps are available (including, without limitation, the Apple App Store) is not liable to you in connection with our apps.\nIf you use any ISBN scan feature of the Services, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the scanned code before relying on it.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Email and Text Message Notifications</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notifications or receipts from Chegg will be delivered to you by email at the address you provided to Chegg when you created your account or as later updated.\nYou may also opt to receive text message reminders from Chegg, as a courtesy to you.\nPlease review our text message mobile disclosures, which are incorporated into the Terms of Use.\nChegg may contact you, sometimes through an automated or pre-recorded message, using the phone numbers you provide to Chegg, including wireless numbers, to remind you that rental books are due to be returned or otherwise provide the Services.\nYou are still responsible for compliance with the Terms of Use, including, e.g., timely return of your books, whether or not you receive such reminders via email, text or otherwise.\nChegg will not ask you for your personal information, account username, and password, or any information about you or your method of payment via email or text message.\nIf you receive such an email or text message purportedly from Chegg, it is fraudulent and Chegg will have no responsibility for any misuse of any information you provide as a result.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Account Cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may request cancellation of your account at any time throughout your use of our Services.\nTo the fullest extent permissible under applicable law, your account will only be cancelled and closed after you have returned all books that have been rented to you (if any) and all transactions have been processed including payment of assessed penalties or the cashing of any refund check, if applicable.\nChegg may cancel your account in its sole discretion any reason, including but not limited to inactivity or misuse.\nEven if your account is cancelled, your photos, bibliographic and citation information, comments, likes, friendships, and any other data you have shared via the Services may persist within the Service after cancellation of your account (for example, if your content has been reshared by others).</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Payments and Payment Processing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Validation:</strong> Chegg may require users of the Services to provide a valid method of payment (e.g., credit or debit card, PayPal account, etc.) tied to an account at a financial institution when they register for an account (to ensure users are able to make applicable payments to Chegg) or upon ordering products or services.\nIf a method of payment is required, you are responsible for ensuring that a valid method of payment is associated with your Chegg account at all times (either the original method of payment or a replacement).\nTo confirm your method of payment is valid, Chegg may initiate a \"pending\" charge on the account.\nThis charge will not be confirmed and, therefore, you will not be charged and it will simply disappear from your financial statement (usually within seven days - check with your financial institution for additional information).\nPlease be aware that this pending charge may be initiated each time you edit the payment information for your account or place an order that cannot be processed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Authorization Holds:</strong> For certain transactions (e.g., book rentals, tutoring sessions), we may authorize anticipated charges and taxes from your method of payment.\nThe amount of the authorization sought will depend on the transaction and may also vary depending on the nature of the payment method you have provided.\nThis is sometimes referred to as an authorization hold and these funds may not be available for your use.\nIf the fees incurred exceed the authorization hold (e.g., because of an auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged book), we may automatically request additional authorization holds.\nIf the provider for your method of payment rejects any authorization, you agree that we may charge any other method of payment we have on file for you (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law).\nAt the conclusion or termination of an ongoing transaction (e.g., return of a rented book), if the charges do not exceed the amount due, the authorization for the amount not utilized will be released per the rules of your payment method provider.\nThe timeframe for an authorization hold to be removed will depend on the policies of your financial institution.You are responsible and liable for ensuring that enough funds are available in connection with the payment method used at the time any transaction is processed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Policies:</strong> Where your billing address is requested, you must provide the address and phone number your financial institution has on record, as well as the card's security code (e.g., CVC, CVV, CID).\nChegg will make reasonable efforts to process your transactions in a timely manner, but we make no guarantees regarding the processing time for charges.\nChegg may store your method of payment and you hereby acknowledge and agree that Chegg may charge you for, and you will pay for, any charges specified on the Services and for any auto-extension or unreturned, lost, stolen, or damaged books associated with your account under the terms of your book rental and in accordance with the General Policies.\nFor any books or other materials kept beyond the applicable rental term, you agree to be charged the applicable late fees as set out in our General Policies.\nFor any books or other rental materials that are never returned (an item is deemed \"never returned\" if it has not been returned in the period posted in our General Polices) or that are returned damaged, you agree to be charged for the value of the item(s) as set out in our General Policies.\nChegg reserves the right to place you into collections if you fail to timely pay for the products and services ordered through the Services.\ncollections may be done by Chegg or a third-party on Chegg's behalf.\nYou also agree that we may, at our discretion, send your account to a collection agency, and recover our reasonable costs of collection from you, if you fail to pay all fees due and owing to Chegg.\nFor security reasons or to otherwise confirm a financial instrument or payment, Chegg may delay mailings of books or otherwise delay providing payments or services even if such delay impacts a guaranteed delivery date.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-Party Links, Content and Applications</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There may be links from the Services, or from communications you receive from the Services, to third-party web sites or online features.\nThe Services also may include third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse.</p>\n<p>Functionality on the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and a third-party web site or online feature, including applications that connect the Services or your profile on the Services with a third-party site.\nFor example, the Services may include a button enabling you to indicate, on your social networking page, that you \"like\" a specific product on the Services, or a feature that lets you post to your social networking page a link to a specific product or the ability to share content from the Services or your User Content with a third-party, which may be publicly posted on that third-party's web site.\nUsing this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party website.\nWe do not control any of these third-party sites or any of their content.\nNeither Chegg nor its service providers are responsible for the practices of any third-party.\nAccordingly, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties about the completeness, accuracy, or existence of any advertising, products, or other materials on or available from third-party sites or online features and any reliance placed by you on such materials is at your own risk.\nYOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT

comply with the above linking requirements.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these Terms of Use, Chegg reserves the right to prohibit linking to any Chegg Website for any reason in our sole and absolute discretion.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Course Searches and Other Information Specific to an Academic Institution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may tie your Chegg experience to information about the school you have identified to Chegg.\nFor certain schools, the Services enable you to search and retrieve information about the materials required for particular courses.\nPlease be aware that course information and assigned materials may change from time to time, and Chegg may not receive updated information from the school in a timely manner.\nChegg is not responsible for any errors in the information provided in the course searches on the Services.\nWhere specific school names or information relate to a specific school are displayed, they do not imply any endorsement or approval by the school.\nExcept where specifically stated, Chegg has no affiliation with nor endorsement from any academic institution, and school names and information are used on the Services only to the extent necessary to organize, identify and permit use of information and sections of the Services that may be tailored to students of a particular school, or for other lawful uses.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Categories of Users</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may use Chegg's homework help services as a \"Member\" or a \"Visitor.\" \"<strong>Members</strong>\" may include a variety of designated levels of members who may be charged for services according to the terms of the particular offer or registered free members (a \"<strong>Free Member</strong>\"), or other membership levels.\n\"<strong>Visitors</strong>\" are users that have not registered for an account with access to and use of certain aspects of the homework help services, which may be restricted and only available to certain Members.\nThe membership levels, the benefits and pricing of each level of membership may vary and are subject to change at any time, please read the terms of any particular level of membership carefully before accepting it.\nChegg may modify these levels and benefits from time to time, and each such modification is effective as soon as we post it on the relevant Services except to the extent that your particular pricing structure is established in writing for a period of time in the future, such as an annual plan.\nIt is therefore important that you review the membership page regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Homework Help, Study Guide and Note Usage</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Chegg's homework help, study and note services are available merely as informational and study aids and should not be considered substitutes for applicable coursework, homework, class and lecture requirements, assignments and related materials.\nIn using the Services, you specifically agree not to use, claim or submit as your own any portion of the help materials.\nChegg does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of answers or other study material that appear on the Services, some of which may be posted by other users.\nYou further agree the Services may present information that is incorrect or inconsistent when compared to similar content and materials, including solutions and their methodologies, provided or preferred by publishers of applicable problems or instructors of applicable courses.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Outlines, Study Guides and Notes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Chegg may permit users to upload and in some cases sell content for the purpose of aiding others in the education and learning process.\nUsers may not post content owned or created (except if it is in the public domain) by another person and hereby represent and warrant that: <strong>(i)</strong> each was created by the user and the user is the sole owner of all content posted to Services sites and all rights in such content (except for public domain content), including, without limitation, copyright and <strong>(ii)</strong> the posting of Content on or through the Services will not breach the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third-party.\nUsers agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing to any third-party for any content provided by you to the Services.\nUsers of the Services agree to exclude from such content any documents, records or files made accessible to them by (a) your school, professor or other instructor, (b) any board of examination, (c) any author or publisher whose works have been used as part of studies or (d) any co-student.</p>\n<p>In creating study related content, students must respect any intellectual property rights that others may have in content.\nAll content posted on the Services must be independently created, transformative and non-derivative.\nIt should not be a transcript or recording of another's independent efforts, nor should it copy from materials purchased from or created by others.\nIt should go beyond simply summarizing material covered in class or in written or recorded materials, but include information raised by students in or outside of class, and independent thought, analysis and commentary.\nClass notes, for example, must be substantially rewritten after class and include independent thought and analysis, research and information.\nnotes that use a lecturer's words or that are not carefully reviewed, rethought and rewritten after class are not useful to or appreciated by students, and not permitted on the Services.</p>\n<p>Schools may have their own policies that place restrictions on a student's ability to make commercial use of study materials, even otherwise lawful materials that the student has independently created.\nYou are responsible for becoming familiar with such policies, abiding by them, and discontinuing the use of any Services if such use is contrary to your school policy or the instruction of your professor.</p>\n<p>Class notes and study guides are solely for the specific use of students in the designated class for which they are created.\nIndividuals who are not registered for a class may not purchase study guides, class notes or outlines for that class.\nCheck the accuracy of all information from study guides, class notes, answers and outlines \u2013 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Chegg does not guarantee their accuracy or completeness, they are simply an aid to the study process.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Career Information and Jobs</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Chegg's site may help students identify potential careers by providing a basic description for a variety of potential jobs.\nIn some cases, Chegg may provide salary ranges for jobs, and point users to potential job opportunities in that field, based upon your interests and skills that you have represented to Chegg that you possess.\nChegg may also help identify skills that are commonly required for those jobs and recommend learning materials that (combined with your own efforts) may help you achieve better proficiency with those skills.\nChegg's attempts to assess your skills, identify gaps, and match those gaps to available learning materials may not be accurate in your particular circumstances.\nChegg is simply one starting point, not an exhaustive list of all potential jobs or opportunities that might be available to you, and in a fast-changing employment landscape Chegg does not guarantee that the descriptions, salaries and job opportunities set out on our site are always up to date, reflect the current job market, or are applicable to the market in your area.\nWe believe that the materials on our site, if you use them and apply yourself, can improve your skills and employability.\nStill, Chegg does not provide in-depth, individualized job counseling, and your success in landing a job in a particular career depends on a wide variety of factors.\nOur system's efforts to identify skills gaps, and recommend learning materials to address those gaps, may not result in improved employment prospects.\ncompleting recommended classes is in not a guarantee of finding employment in that field, or any other field.\n</p>\n<p> Chegg may also help students or alumni find internships or entry level jobs or other positions by accepting postings of job descriptions from third-party employers, through its Internships.com website or other Chegg Websites.\nChegg does not confirm the accuracy of the postings, nor can Chegg know whether a particular position has been filled.\nChegg may recommend particular job postings to particular users based upon available data about the position or the user, or other criteria, but the actual

Disputes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a dispute arises between you and Chegg, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.\nAccordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of the Terms of Use or the Services or your use of the Services (a \"<strong>Claim</strong>\") in accordance with the subsections below.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>General.</strong> You and Chegg agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, \"<strong>Disputes</strong>\") will be settled by binding arbitration.\nexcept that either party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court.\nWithout limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Disputes if you provide Chegg with written notice of your desire to do so by email at https://www.chegg.com/contactus/ or regular mail at our offices located at Chegg, Inc., 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054, Attn: General Counsel within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms of Use (such notice, an \"Arbitration Opt-out Notice\").\nIf you do not provide Chegg with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth with respect to individual actions in small claims courts.\n<strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and Chegg are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</strong> Further, unless both you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \"Legal Disputes\" section will be deemed void.\nThis \"Legal Disputes\" section will survive any termination of these Terms of Use.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or proprietary rights or breach of the User Content and Activities provisions of this Agreement.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.</strong> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"<strong>AAA</strong>\") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \"<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\") then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms of Use.\n(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\nThese Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides forms for use in arbitration proceedings including a Demand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules here.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong> Unless you and Chegg otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Chegg submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitrator's Decision.</strong> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of Limitation of Liability section of these Terms of Use as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nChegg will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Fees.</strong> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Chegg will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes.</strong> If Chegg changes this Legal Disputes section, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to legal) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \"Last Updated\" date.\nBy rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Chegg in accordance with the provisions of this Section as of the date you first accepted the terms of these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use).</p>\n<p>This \"Legal Disputes\" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Policies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When

publisher's suggested list price, the Services may not show a list price in the online catalog.\nIf a product is listed at an incorrect price due to typographical error or an error in pricing information received from our suppliers or for any other reason, Chegg shall have the right to refuse or cancel any order (to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law), whether or not the order has been confirmed and your method of payment charged.\nIf your method of payment has already been charged and your order is canceled, Chegg will issue a credit to your method of payment.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Chegg Credit</strong>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, Chegg may issue you \"Chegg Credit.\" Upon providing you Chegg Credit, to the fullest extent permitted under

not expire, though we may with notice after a posted period of time convert your credit to cash and send it to your address of record.\nIf the credit was given to you with terms explicitly authorizing redemption for cash, you may convert that credit to cash.\nIf you receive a credit from customer support, you may not redeem it for cash.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Chegg Discount Codes, Bonuses, Coupons, Loyalty Programs, Points Programs &amp.\nOther Promotions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, Chegg may offer discounts, bonuses, coupons, loyalty programs, points programs, sweepstakes, contests or other promotional incentives.\nThese incentives typically have their own specific rules, restrictions and limitations (e.g., limiting when, how often, and under what circumstances you may be eligible for the promotion).\nYou are responsible for carefully reviewing and complying with these applicable rules, restrictions and limitations.\nYou agree not to engage in any self-dealing, collusion, smurfing (defined as breaking large orders or sales transactions into multiple individual transactions for the purpose of obtaining multiple discounts or payments), or otherwise gaming or defrauding the system.\nBy participating in such promotions, you agree to be bound by the applicable rules and restrictions, and that Chegg, in its sole discretion, may deny payment or benefits to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law (e.g., when it believes improper activity has occurred or when a code has expired).\nAll promotions may expire at any time without notice to recipients.\nDiscounts apply only toward the actual base product/service rental or purchase cost.\nthey do not apply to taxes, shipping, extension or late fees, or any other additional fees (e.g., conversion to purchase fees).</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Return of Digital Access Codes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Through the Services, you may purchase, as a separate product, a digital access code (DAC) to certain Digital Content.\nThe DAC publishers allow only one user (one activation) of these codes.\nChegg will ship your ordered DAC to you in sealed packaging.\nIf the DAC packaging is opened, Chegg must assume that the code is activated and therefore cannot be resold.\nThus, you may not return a DAC with opened packaging for a refund.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Tax</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Rentals and purchases through the Services may be subject to taxes in many states.\nDepending on your state and the nature of the product or service you receive from us, this may be a rental tax, sales tax and/or use tax.\nTax rates are different from state to state.\nYou are responsible for paying all such taxes.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Supplemental Materials</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that supplemental materials (CDs and CD-ROMs, Workbooks, Study Guides) will be included with book rentals.\nHowever, they are available for purchase on select titles.\nIf you receive your rental book with any of the above items, you are welcome to use it.\nWe ask that you return your book complete with any supplemental materials you received.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Asset Ownership</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All rentals remain the property of Chegg, or third-party partners for physical text books, even while the item is in your possession.\nYou may be given the option to purchase rented books from Chegg or third-party partners, either at the end of a rental cycle or at any point during the rental cycle.\nIf you wish to purchase a book you have rented through the Services, you may be able to do so by accessing your account on the Services and looking for the purchase option.\nIn this case, title (ownership) transfers to you as soon as your method of payment is approved for purchase value.\nIf you purchase the title through our purchase program, title (ownership) changes hands when we or our third-party partners provide the book to the shipping company.\nCertain digital products may not be available for purchase or may have different purchase terms, and you should review their specific terms prior to rental or purchase.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Certain Payments and Renewals</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Payment for certain Services is due in advance of each applicable membership period (e.g., monthly or annually).\n<strong>MONTHLY AND ANNUAL MEMBERSHIPS MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOUR CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU WILL BE CHARGED ON THE FIRST DAY OF EACH RENEWAL PERIOD UNTIL YOUR MEMBERSHIP IS TERMINATED BY US OR CANCELLED BY YOU.\nIF ANY OF OUR CHARGES ARE REJECTED FROM THE PAYMENT METHOD YOU HAVE INDICATED IS YOUR PREFERABLE PAYMENT METHOD, YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION: (I) RETRY SUCH PAYMENT METHOD.\nAND/OR (II) COLLECT FROM ANY OTHER PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU.</strong> Also, for some of our paid Services, you may elect to temporarily \"suspend\" your membership, for example, during school breaks or vacation, for up to a total of 90 days in any one membership year (i.e., during each 12-month period following the commencement of your membership), and the period of your membership will be extended by the total amount of such suspended period(s).\nYou agree to pay all applicable fees for your memberships and use of our paid Services, plus any applicable taxes or other charges as may be required, when due and payable.\nAll fees and charges are payable in advance and non-refundable, including after cancellation, unless otherwise disclosed at the time of purchase.\nIf you wish to cancel your membership in a Service (if available), please visit the customer support web area on the Services.\nCancellation of memberships (if available) will take effect as detailed in the cancellation information for the specific Service you want to cancel.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Free Trial Memberships</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services.\nSuch trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence.\nUsers that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise.\nYou can cancel a free trial online on the Services or by contacting Chegg's customer support.\nAfter cancellation of a free trial, you may be able to continue as a Free Member with reduced benefits or access.\nOnly one free trial membership is allowed per person.\nSubsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials.\nUnless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include \"free\" periods with \"paid\" periods, paid periods will elapse first.\nWe may introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Services which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of membership at our sole discretion.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Chegg Honor Code</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We know that most of you have never and will never abuse the Services or any of the information, services or materials available through them.\nYou agree to abide by our Honor Code.</p>\n<p>You may not use any of the solutions, answers, materials or information available on or through the Services, to cheat.\nExamples include:</p>\n<p>1.\nSubmitting any textbook solutions from the Services as your own to any class.<br> 2.\nUsing our questions and answers service to complete tests or homework when instructed not to use outside help.<br> 3.\nOtherwise passing along any solutions, answers, materials or information from the Services as your own.<br> 4.\nAny other violation of your instructor's or school's academic honor code.</p>\n<p>We will take swift action against anyone found violating this Honor Code.\nIf Chegg is presented with evidence that its Services have been used in a manner contrary to its Honor Code or any other part of these Terms of Use, Chegg may, in its sole discretion, remove the materials and terminate the account of the involved users.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>A message to students:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As current and former students, the Chegg team understands the pressures and time constraints school creates.\nThat being said, we also know from the unfortunate tales of our peers that the risk you take by violating your school's code of academic integrity is not worth the reward.\nCopying solutions or posting unexplained final answers promotes completion without comprehension, and that's something we don't support on the Services.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>A message to educators:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are always seeking opportunities to work with educators in making our Websites a valuable resource for both you and your classroom for years to come.\nIf you need to contact us concerning an issue of academic integrity, please e-mail us at on Honor Code .</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Use, if any provision of the Terms of Use is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all remaining provisions continue in full force and effect.\nThe failure of Chegg to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use is not a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe section titles of the Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nNon-performance of either party, except for the failure to make required payments, will be excused to the extent performance is delayed or rendered impossible by any reason where failure to perform is beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing party.\nThis \"Miscellaneous\" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Chegg may modify the Terms of Use including the linked policies contained herein from time to time (\"Updated Terms\").\nYou agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Chegg Website so that they are accessible via a link on the home page, and that your use of our Services after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify), you agree to be bound by the then-current version of the Terms of Use, including any changes we may have made since the last time you used our Services.\nIt is therefore important that you review the Terms of Use regularly to ensure you are aware of any such changes.\nThe updated Terms of Use will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the updated Terms of Use, and will apply to your use of the Services from that point forward.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Entire Agreement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The then-current Terms of Use, including (a) any related policies and terms referenced in the Terms of Use and (b) any Additional Terms, are the entire agreement between you and Chegg regarding the Services.\nThe Terms of Use may not be modified without the consent of a duly authorized representative of Chegg and will supersede and prevail over any terms or conditions you may include with any purchase order or other transaction document or communication with us, regardless of whether Chegg signs them or fails to object to them.\nThis \"Entire Agreement\" section shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Chegg.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Contacting Chegg</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have
