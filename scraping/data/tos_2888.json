categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nOur disclosure requirements apply only if we share our consumers\u2019 personal information with third parties for them to directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own business.\nIf you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us as provided in the \"Contact Us\" section below.</p>3.\nCCPA Disclosures and

collected from consumers or users of our Services within the last twelve (12) months.\nThe categories and examples provided in the chart below are those defined in the CCPA.\nThis does not mean that

identification codes, student financial information, or student disciplinary records.\nK.\nInferences drawn from other personal information.Profile reflecting a person\u2019s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, predispositions, behavior, attitudes, intelligence, abilities, and aptitudes.\n<p>In response to a verified consumer request for categories of information

response would be the same for all consumers and this Privacy Policy discloses all the information that is otherwise required for the response to such a consumer request.</p>3.2 Sources of Personal Information.<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Directly from you.\nFor example, during account registration from forms you complete, subscriptions you purchase or comments you provide on our

our Services within the last twelve months where such disclosure may fall within the CCPA\u2019s definition of a \"sale.\" When we disclose that we may have sold Personal Information, it means that we may have received some kind of benefit to our company in return for sharing Personal Information, it does not necessarily mean we received any money in exchange.</p>\n<p>The categories below are those defined in the CCPA.\nThis does not mean that all examples of that category of Personal Information were in fact \"sold\" but reflects our good faith belief to the best of our knowledge that some of that information may have been shared for value in return.\nWe will update this disclosure from time to time as appropriate.</p>\n<p>In response to a verified consumer request for categories of Personal Information \"sold,\" we will investigate and provide an individualized response to the consumer, and will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined in this Privacy

response to the consumer, which will include the business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or sharing that information.\nWe will not merely refer the consumer to our general practices outlined

to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions, including if we need the Personal Information for a reason related to

request to us through the web form link provided below in Contact Us.</p>\n<p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.</p>\n<p>The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\nThis means that in making a request you may be required to: provide your email and phone number, customer information, and/or account sign-up authentication or other information needed to verify your identity depending on the sensitivity of the Personal Information that is the subject of the request.</p>\n<p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.\nIf we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to deny the request.\n</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.\nWe will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n<p>If you choose to use an authorized agent to submit a request to know or a request to delete your information, we may require that you: (1) provide the authorized agent written permission to do so.\nand (2) verify your own identity directly with us.\nWe will not require these steps if we have received proof that you have provided the authorized agent with a power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465.\nWe may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.\nWe may also deny a request from an agent that does not meet the requirements for authorized agents under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>Once we have verified your identity (and your authorized agent, as applicable), we will respond to your request as appropriate.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your

only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt.\nIf we cannot comply with any portion of a request, the response we provide will also explain why, if applicable.\nFor data portability requests, we will select a commercially reasonable format to provide your Personal Information that is commonly useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, but we do not guarantee that all formats are useable in all media.\nWe do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>3.6.3 Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of CCPA Privacy Rights<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nIn

to help protect the confidentiality of Personal Information.\nHowever, no data transmitted over the Internet or stored or maintained by us or our third-party service providers can be 100% secure given the reality of communication via technology systems.\nTherefore, although we believe the measures implemented by us are commercially reasonable and reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your Personal Information or private communications sent to us over those systems will always remain private or secure.\nWe are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security features.</p>\n<p>If you believe that your Personal Information has been accessed or

media platforms or the information they may collect (which may include IP address).\nYou should refer to such third parties\u2019 privacy policies on their sites to determine their respective privacy
