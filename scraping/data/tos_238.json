the same content.\nYour use of the Resilio Client to download files will, in turn, enable other Resilio users to download pieces of those files from you.\nAlthough your IP address is associated with your piece of the file, other users will not have access to any other personal information about you.We do not track which files you transfer with the Resilio Client.\nMerely using the Resilio Client does not cause a record of which files you transfer to be kept by Resilio or Resilio on behalf of any third party.<br>\n</p>\n<strong>Gathering and Use of Non-personally Identifiable

called a cookie ID: a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the browser on which the cookie is stored.\nThis allows websites and servers to distinguish the browser from other browsers that store different cookies, and to recognize each browser by its unique cookie ID.\nThe use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them.\nCookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences.\nFor example, by setting a cookie you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time.\nThird party analytics, ad-serving and affiliate partners may set or have cookies set and access their cookies or local storage objects on your computer, when you are using the Resilio Client or visiting a Resilio website and may collect information about your online activities across websites or online services.\nOther companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies,
