<p>BadCreditLoans.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) is operated by&nbsp;Chief LLC (the \u201cWebsite Operator,\u201d \u201cWe\u201d or \u201cUs\u201d), which is a limited liability company established in Nevada.\nBy using the Website you accept to the below terms of use:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Neither BadCreditLoans.com nor the Website Operator are lenders or the issuers of any loan product or other product featured on the Website.\nAny services or products that are presented to you and accepted by you are issued by third party vendors and service providers.\nThe management and customer care of any service or product provided to you are the responsibility of the third party vendors and service providers who issued the service or product.\nIf you receive an order confirmation form or receipt from a loan request, this does not signify that your loan request was accepted or that you will necessarily be given a loan.\nWe are not responsible for unsuccessful loan requests as a result of the requester not qualifying for a loan per the loan service agents\u2019 requirements.\nIf you have any questions regarding your loan request status you must communicate with your lender directly because we cannot access this information due to lending privacy laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>We may receive compensation for successful or unsuccessful product or service requests from third parties.\nAny such compensation arrangements that are in place are not related to your use of the Website.\nWe also may choose to modify any of the Terms of Use and your use of the Website will subsequently comply with the amended Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>You must be a citizen or legal resident of the United States and be over the age of 18 to use the Website or

storage and use of your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Late Payments</strong>\n<br>\nThe most important thing that you must understand as a borrower is the repercussions of making late payments on your loan.\nAlthough each lender that we work with has its own terms and conditions for the loan and the repayment of the loan, there are some general repercussions that it is important for you to understand.\nThere will likely be charges for making a late payment.\nSimilarly, if you are extending a loan, the finance charge for the original loan must be paid on the original due date.\nThen your loan principal will be deferred with an additional finance charge.\nWe recommend paying as much as possible towards your original due date in order to further reduce the charges you incur.\nIf you plan to deviate from your payment plan, you should contact your lender immediately to setup a new payment arrangement.\nIf your loan payment is rejected for any reason by your bank, the lender may initiate collection procedures and you will be prevented from receiving future loans from the lender until all of your payment obligations are met in full.\nThe most important thing to remember is to read about the payment options and penalties for the specific lender that you are connected with and to make sure that you fully understand these policies.\nLastly, remember that personal loans should be used only for short-term financial needs.\nThey are not a long-term financial solution.\nIn general you should always make sure to pay all of your outstanding loans/bills/debts on time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Missing a Payment</strong>\n<br>\nBadCreditLoans.com strongly recommends that you pay all of your outstanding debt/loans/bills when they are due.\nThis will ensure that you will have a good payment record and minimize negative repercussions.\nEach lender that BadCreditLoans.com works with has their own terms and conditions governing the specific implications of missing a payment.\nHowever, if the lender does not receive a payment the likely result is that the lender will begin collection procedures against you and you will no longer be able to receive any more loans from the lender.\nTherefore, it is important for you to both understand the specific requirements for repayment and the repercussions of missing a payment.\nAnd, again we strongly urge you to pay all outstanding debts/loans/bills on time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Compliance</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree to not engage in any unlawful activities pertaining to the use of
