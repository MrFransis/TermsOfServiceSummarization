or third parties are not applicable and are not part of the contract, even if we do not separately object to their application in individual cases.</p>\n<p>1.3\tWe expressly reserve the right to make changes to our Terms and Conditions, System Policies and prices by giving the Customer prior notification via their customer account or using the email address the Customer enters in their contact

concludes a contract for processing orders with us.\nThis contract for processing orders is not concluded automatically.\nWe can offer the Customer the opportunity to conclude a contract for processing orders via the Customer\u2019s account, if necessary, which is supplemented by EU standard contractual clauses, if the Customer orders products that are located in a third country.</p>\n<p>6.3.\nWe hereby warn the Customer that we are generally unable to determine whether the Customer is processing personal data.\nThe Customer is therefore obligated to provide us with the necessary information, in particular whether personal data of third parties are processed, for what purpose these data are processed and which categories the personal data and the data subjects are to be assigned.\nIn the absence of a contract for order processing with the necessary information from the Customer, we assume that the Customer is not processing third party personal data using our services, so we will not take any measures in accordance with data protection law.</p>\n<p>6.4.\nWe hereby warn the Customer that, given the current state of technology, there is still no all-embracing form of protection for data transmission on the internet.\nThe Customer is responsible for the safety and security of all data they store on any of their products.\n</p> 7.\nUse by third

rights to their Hetzner services to a third party, the Customer is obligated at the time of transfer to ensure that all legal and contractual provisions are followed.\nThis is true for any changes that require the cooperation of the third party.\n</p>\n<p>7.3.\nIf the third party violates the contractual obligations or does not comply with the obligation to cooperate, if the data provided by the third party is incorrect or incomplete, or if other problems arise with the granting of user rights to third parties, the Customer assumes full liability for all resulting damages and, in

of these obligations.</p>\n<p>8.2.\nThe Customer is obligated not to publish any content that infringes on the rights of third parties or otherwise violates applicable law.\nThis includes in particular, but is not limited to, pornographic or obscene material, extremist content or content that offends common decency, gambling, material that could seriously endanger the morals of children

in the event of non-compliance.</p>\n<p>8.4.\nIf we become aware of illegal activities, we are obligated under \u00a7 10 Telemedia Act (TMG) to request that the Customer immediately removes the offending content and we are entitled to lock the Customer\u2019s access to their Hetzner services or account.</p> 9.\nLiability\n<p>9.1.\nThe Customer uses Hetzner services at their own risk.\nWe are liable for indirect damages in the case of intent or gross negligence, but not for loss of profit.\nWe are liable for culpable infringements that are not due to gross negligence or intent for the foreseeable damage typical for this type of contract, up to a maximum of 100 % of the price for the Customer's monthly product rental.</p>\n<p>9.2.\nIf the Customer violates the content obligations mentioned in Section 8 of these Terms and Conditions, in particular regarding legal prohibitions and decency violations, the Customer is liable to us for compensation for all direct or indirect damages arising from this, including financial losses.\nFurthermore, the Customer is obligated to indemnify us against claims by third parties - irrespective of the legal basis - resulting from the

obligation by the user.</p> 11.\nRight of lien <p>The Customer grants us a lien on equipment installed by the Customer or by third parties in the data center to protect any outstanding debts arising from the contractual relationship.\nWe are entitled to enforce the lien after informing the customer of their outstanding debts if the Customer does not settle all outstanding debts within 10 work days after receiving the notification of sale.\nAny surpluses generated by the sale are paid out to the Customer.</p> 12.\nCancellation policy\n<p>12.1.\nThe Customer has the right to cancel this contract within fourteen days after the conclusion of the contract without providing any reasons.\nTo exercise their right to cancel this contract, the Customer is required to notify us, Hetzner

purpose, although it is not mandatory.\nTo meet the cancellation requirements, it is sufficient for the Customer to send a clearly worded notification that they wish to exercise their right of cancellation before the cancellation deadline.</p>\n<p>12.2.\nCancellation procedure If the Customer cancels this contract, we will immediately or at the latest fourteen days from the date of our receiving the notice of cancellation of this contract, refund all payments we have received from the Customer including delivery charges (with the exception of additional charges arising from the

mutually agree otherwise.\nUnder no circumstances is the Customer charged any fees for this refund.<br>\n<br> If the cancelled item is a service that has already begun at the time of cancellation, we will invoice the Customer for the corresponding pro rata amount.</p>\n<p>12.3.\nOur cancellation form is available at: https://www.hetzner.com/legal/withdrawal/</p> 13.\nDispute resolution procedure

participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.</p> 14.\nFinal provisions and severability clause\n<p>14.1.\nThese Terms and Conditions and the contractual relationship between us and the Customer are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and international private law.</p>\n<p>14.2.\nThe international and exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contractual relationship is our registered office in Gunzenhausen.\nWe are, however, entitled in all cases to initiate legal proceedings at the Customer's place of business.\nSuperordinate statutory provisions, in particular, on exclusive jurisdiction, remain unaffected.</p>\n<p>14.3.\nIf any provision is or becomes invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part, this has no effect on the validity of the remaining provisions.\nThe same applies if and to the extent that an omission be revealed in this contract.\nIn place of the invalid or unenforceable provision, an appropriate provision will apply which, as far as legally possible, corresponds to the sense and purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision or to the presumed intention of the parties, just as if they had considered this point.</p>\n<p> Version 2.0.0 / Last updated 27 October
