Introduction <p>The National Geographic Society is an impact-driven global nonprofit organization that uses the power of science, exploration, education, and storytelling to illuminate and protect the wonder of our world.</p>\n<p>The National Geographic Society (nationalgeographic.org) understands the importance of your privacy, and we take our responsibility to protect it seriously.&nbsp.\nOur Privacy Notice tells you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>What information we collect about you when you visit this website or use an online resource that contains a link to this Privacy Policy (the \u201cServices\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How we use, share and protect this information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What choices you have about how this information is used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How you can access and update this information.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, so we will update this Privacy Notice as we develop new approaches to personal data protection or adopt new policies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b2.\u200b&nbsp;Data Protection Officer <p>The National Geographic Society (NGS) is headquartered in Washington, DC, in the United States.&nbsp.\nNGS has appointed an internal data protection officer for you to contact if you have any questions or concerns about NGS\u2019s personal data policies or practices.\nThe NGS data protection officer\u2019s contact information is below:</p>\n<p>Data Protection Officer</p>\n<p>National Geographic Society</p>\n<p>1145 17th St., NW</p>\n<p>Washington, DC 20036, USA</p>\n<p>dataprivacy@ngs.org</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b3.\u200b&nbsp;How we collect and use (process) your personal information \u200b3.1\u200b&nbsp;Summary <p>NGS collects personal information about its visitors, members, donors, grant applicants, and grantees.&nbsp.\nYour level of engagement with NGS determines the amount and type of information we will collect, and the majority of the information we collect is given to us directly from you.&nbsp.\nTypically this information is limited to contact information like what can be found on a business card: first name, last name, address, email address, and phone number.\nWe use this information to provide constituents with goods, services, and NGS updates.&nbsp.\nWe do not sell personal information to anyone.\nWe do share personal information with third party vendors who are facilitating the delivery of NGS services, and in limited instances, with other organizations who are aligned with NGS\u2019s mission, vision, and values.</p> \u200b3.2\u200b&nbsp;Personal information you give to us \u200b3.2.1\u200b&nbsp;Donations <p>If you give a donation to the National Geographic Society, we ask for your name, postal address, email address, and your credit card number in order to process your gift and send a thank you letter and tax receipt to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are giving a gift in honor or memory of another person, we will also ask you for that person\u2019s name, and the name and postal address of the person to whom you want an honor or memory gift notification to be sent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may also ask you to tell us what programs or issues you are interested in, if and how you would like your gift designated, and if and how you would like to be contacted in order to tailor your experience with us to your interests and preferences.</p> \u200b3.2.3\u200b&nbsp;Grants, Challenges, Project Funding, and Awards <p>If you apply for or receive grants, funding, or awards, NGS stores additional information&nbsp.\nrelated to application details, external and internal review information, details related to the execution of grant agreements and payment, final reporting, media related to the work funded, and feedback on the success of the grant.&nbsp;</p> \u200b3.2.4\u200b&nbsp;Attending our museum or an event <p>If you purchase a ticket to National Geographic Museum or an event at NGS headquarters, NGS stores data related to that transaction including name, address, phone number, email, and purchase method.\nIf you fill out additional information via a survey or provide subsequent information related to interests, how you learned about the exhibition or event or demographic information, that may be stored as well.&nbsp;</p> \u200b3.2.5\u200b&nbsp;Competitions/Challenges or Contests&nbsp.\n(See Section 4.2 for specifics on the GeoBee and GeoChallenge below) <p>If you participate in a competition, we ask for your name, phone number, the name of your school principal (if applicable), name of student(s) competing and also email addresses of students\u2019 parents.\nFor collecting payment, we will ask for credit card name, address, phone number and credit card number.&nbsp.\nFor students that are traveling with a coach, we will collect a health form to insure appropriate care while away from home.\nFor contests, we will collect entry information (name, address, phone number).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \u200b3.2.6\u200b&nbsp;Online educational resources <p>There are many online educational resources that do not require any data collection beyond web analytics.\nOnline courses require a sign-up process that collects email address, state, first name, last name, organization (school where course participant works).&nbsp.\nParticipants write a brief bio of themselves on the course platform, and respond to a post-course survey identifying grade and subject taught.</p> \u200b3.2.7\u200b&nbsp;Surveys, sweepstakes, etc.\n<p>If you participate in an activity such as a survey or sweepstakes, we may also ask you to provide other types of information such as gender and personal interests, which we may then use to enhance and customize your experience with our Services.</p> \u200b3.3\u200b&nbsp;Personal information we get from third parties <p>NGS sometimes uses third parties and publicly available sources to validate, update, and enrich the information you provide.&nbsp.\nWe do this to 1) ensure contact information such as email address, phone number, and mailing address are accurate and up to date, and 2) gather relevant demographic, financial, and biographical information about grant applicants and donor prospects to inform internal business processes.&nbsp;</p> \u200b3.4\u200b&nbsp;Personal Information contained in user content <p>Some parts of our Services may allow users to post or transmit messages, comments, screen names, computer files and other materials.\nIf you choose to make personal information public through these Services, National Geographic Society will consider that information public.&nbsp;</p> \u200b3.5\u200b&nbsp;Transferring personal data from the EU to the US <p>Our Site is maintained in the United States of America.\nThe information we collect from you through our services may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the USA and other destinations outside the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or other country in which you are located.\nThis includes processing by us, our affiliates, our third party service companies and other third parties as described in this Policy.\nYou explicitly consent and agree to such transfer, storing and/or processing of your Personal Information outside the EEA or other country in which you are located.\nYou understand that data stored in the USA may be subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the USA.\nThe USA may not have data protection laws that are as comprehensive or protective as those in your country of residence.\nhowever, our collection, storage and use of your Personal Information will at all times be in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b4.\u200b&nbsp;Children\u2019s Privacy \u200b4.1\u200b&nbsp;Use of Websites <p>The Services NGS provides are not intended for visits from children under the age of 13, or under the age of 16 in the case of children in the European Economic Area (EEA), and we do not knowingly permit children under these ages to register for any content, product or Service.\n&nbsp.\nOur Services are general audience services, and we do not knowingly collect information about children through them.\nShould a child make known to us his or her personally identifiable information, we will use that information only to respond directly to that child to inform him or her that we must have parental consent before receiving his or her personally identifiable information, or to respond otherwise in a manner consistent with applicable rules and laws.\nIf we learn that we have collected personally identifiable information from a child other than in a manner authorized by law, we will delete that information from our database.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sites managed by National Geographic Partners, LLC (an independently owned and operated legal entity), nationalgeographic.com -- including www.kids.nationalgeographic.com and kids.nationalgeographic.com/littlekids&nbsp;-- are not subject to the control of NGS.&nbsp.\nPlease refer to the Data Privacy Policy of National Geographic Partners for additional information.</p> \u200b4.2\u200b&nbsp;GeoBee and GeoChallenge <p>The GeoBee and GeoChallenge programs are designed to challenge and recognize the achievements of middle school students in the United States.&nbsp.\nIn order to administer these programs, National Geographic Society\u2019s Education Department collects and stores students\u2019 information, along with the information about their schools, teachers, and project sponsors.&nbsp.\nThe information we collect includes: name, school, grade, gender, video submissions, and sometimes payment and travel data.</p>\n<p>Many times this information is collected by the school or project sponsor on behalf of the students, though the students may also provide this information themselves.&nbsp.\nPrior to doing so, the schools and project sponsors are provided with National Geographic Society Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) notification which describes the information we collect and the rights parents have over their child\u2019s data.&nbsp.\nWhile NGS is exempt from Federal Trade Commission (FTC) oversight, and thereby the COPPA law, we nevertheless believe it is important for us to provide this notification in the interest of protecting the privacy of the children who participate in these programs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b5.\u200b&nbsp;Use of National Geographic Society websites \u200b5.1\u200b&nbsp;Summary <p>NGS websites collect certain information automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp.\nThis

Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects.&nbsp.\nIf you are a resident of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and the Services are targeted to you, please note:</p>\n<p>The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that strengthened the protection of \u201cpersonal data\u201d (any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, so called \u201cdata subjects\u201d) in light of rapid technological developments, the increasingly global nature of business and more complex international flows of personal data.\nThe GDPR replaces a patchwork of national data protection laws with a single set of rules, directly enforceable in each EU member state.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We keep your personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.\nThe criteria used to determine our retention periods include (i) for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you.\n(ii) as required by a legal obligation to which we are subject.\nor (iii) as advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard of applicable statutes of limitations and litigation).</p>\n<p>You may request information about: the general purpose of the processing.\nthe categories of personal data concerned.\nwho else outside NGS may have received data from NGS.\nwhat the source of the information was (if you didn\u2019t provide it directly to NGS).\nand how long it will be stored.&nbsp.\nYou have the right to correct (rectify) the record of your personal data maintained by NGS if it is inaccurate.\nYou may request that NGS erase that data or cease processing it, subject to certain exceptions.\nYou may also request that NGS cease using your data for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp.\nIn many countries, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how NGS processes your personal data.\nWhen technically feasible, NGS will\u2014at your request\u2014provide your personal data to you or transmit it directly to another controller at your request.</p>\n<p>Reasonable access to your personal data will be provided at no cost to you upon request made to NGS at dataprivacy@ngs.org.\nIf access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, NGS will provide you with a date when the information will be provided.\nIf for some reason access is denied, NGS will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b8.\u200b&nbsp;Security of your information <p>We take a number of steps to safeguard any personally identifiable information or credit card information that you provide to us.\nWe use data encryption technology to help protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your credit card information.\nCryptographic algorithms and protocols protect the credit card information sent between your computer and our database.\nHowever, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and therefore we cannot warrant or guarantee that such information will never be accessed, used or released in a manner that is inconsistent with this policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b9.\u200b&nbsp;Data storage and retention <p>We keep your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.\nThe criteria used to determine our retention periods include 1) for as long as we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you.\n2) as required by a legal obligation to which we are subject.\nor 3) as advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard of applicable statutes of limitations and litigation).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> \u200b10.\u200b&nbsp;Changes and updates to the Privacy Notice <p>By using this Site, you agree to the terms and conditions

or any NGS services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As our organizational practices, policies, and processes change from time to time, this Privacy Notice is expected to change as well.\nWe reserve the right to amend the Privacy Notice at any time, for any reason, without notice to you, other than the posting of the amended Privacy Notice at this Site.\nWe may email periodic reminders of our notices and terms and conditions and will email notifications to you, but you should check our Site frequently to see the current Privacy Notice that is in effect and any changes that may have been made to it.\nThe

Policy&nbsp;|&nbsp.\nTerms of Service&nbsp;|&nbsp.\nCode of Ethics</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Code of Ethics <p>The policy and legal requirements that govern how the National Geographic Society conducts business</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Photo by Mark Thiessen</p> A MESSAGE FROM&nbsp;PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING&nbsp;OFFICER MIKE ULICA&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<p>National Geographic Society uses the power of science, exploration, education, and storytelling to illuminate and protect the wonder of our world.\nOur success achieving this ambitious mission starts with your unwavering personal commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It\u2019s the foundation of who we are and how we work.\nIt\u2019s the reason National Geographic is one of the most recognized and trusted brands in the world.\nIt\u2019s why so many talented people and organizations want to partner with us.\nMaintaining this trust, which we have earned since our founding in 1888, is essential to our mission.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fundamental principles we live by are straightforward \u2014 always act with honesty, fairness and transparency.\nThese principles are not always easy to apply given the complexities of the world in which we work.\nThat\u2019s why we have our Code of Ethics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is our collective starting point to make sure each of us puts the Society\u2019s expectations for ethical conduct to good practice.\nThe Code of Ethics takes the principles that have made our organization successful and puts them together in a way that will hopefully make them easier for you to apply \u2014 and to get help if you have a question or encounter a challenging situation.\nBe sure to read and recommit yourself to these principles.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And I strongly encourage you to ask questions if you have any concerns about any business practice or conduct you observe at work.\nThere is a wealth of resources available to support you in raising issues, getting answers to any questions and addressing concerns you may have \u2014 all in recognition of just how vital your thoughts and questions are when it comes to our ethical standards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continuing commitment to integrity and upholding the highest standard of ethical conduct in your work for the Society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mike Ulica<br>\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer<br>\nNational Geographic Society</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction<p>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic Society\u2019s success is built on the foundation of each staff member acting according to the highest standard of ethical behavior, including honesty, fairness and transparency.</p>\n<p>Our Code of Ethics establishes this as the fundamental requirement for everything you do on behalf of the Society.\nThe Code also serves as a roadmap to put the Society\u2019s ethical standards into practice.\nIt summarizes some of our key policies for doing business consistent with our standards, and the law.\nThe Code does not describe all policies, or the underlying laws each of us must follow.\nnor does it give full details on any individual policy or law.\nIt offers links to additional information (including underlying policies) and contacts to help answer any questions you might have, or resolve difficult situations you might face.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Reading the Code of Ethics is not a substitute for reading and familiarizing yourself with National Geographic Society\u2019s policies.\nYou are responsible for understanding and following all Society policies that apply to your position.\nIf you are unclear about those policies, or how to comply with them, it is your responsibility to find out.\nThere are many resources available to help including your manager, Human Resources, Legal and Business Affairs (L&amp;BA) and the Society\u2019s Ethics Officer.\nContact information is available on the last page of the Code.</p>\n<p>Importantly, we expect our third party representatives (independent contractors, agents, consultants, suppliers, business partners and others who support our mission or receive our funds) to act with the same high standards that our Code of Ethics requires of us, and to comply with all policies applicable to the work they do on National Geographic Society\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Maintain the Highest Standards of Ethical Conduct<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our brand trust and reputation is ultimately the result of the personal integrity and highest standards of ethical conduct you demonstrate in everything you do for National Geographic Society<b>.</b>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You must exercise the highest standard of ethical decision making, and sound professional judgment regardless of where or when you are doing business on National Geographic Society\u2019s behalf.\nThere are two basic principles that must guide your actions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Conduct every aspect of your business in a fair, lawful, and ethical manner;</li>\n<li>Encourage and expect everyone you work with to do the same.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are deeply committed to performing our mission in a manner that earns the respect of everyone we interact with including: charitable donors, business associates, third party representatives, Society members, our staff, explorers, fellows, grantees and the general public.\nWe believe that the consistent application of our standard of ethical conduct is the best way to do it.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for promoting the Society\u2019s mission in a fair, ethical and professional manner.\nThe professionalism you demonstrate in your work helps us sustain and enhance the Society\u2019s reputation.\nIt\u2019s also what makes the Society a great place to work.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Avoid Conflicts of Interest<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most potential conflicts can be resolved in a simple and mutually acceptable way<b>.\n</b>The key is to disclose it promptly \u2013 before it becomes an actual conflict that could compromise your responsibility to act in National Geographic Society\u2019s best interest exclusively<b>.</b>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A conflict of interest arises when you, a family member or close friend have a business, financial or personal interest in the other side of a transaction or business dealings with National Geographic Society.\nYou must always act in the best interest of National Geographic Society.\nThis includes being sensitive to situations where it might appear your responsibility to the Society is compromised.</p>\n<p>Here are some ways a conflict of interest might arise:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A personal, family, or financial interest in any Society transaction;</li>\n<li>Acting as an employee, consultant (or providing any other assistance) to a competitor;</li>\n<li>A financial interest in a competitor, supplier, contractor, grantee or fellow.\nconsultant, or other business partner;</li>\n<li>Hiring or supervising a family member;</li>\n<li>Accepting gifts, discounts, services beyond policy limits from anyone doing (or seeking) business with National Geographic Society.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a potential conflict, you must report it to your manager \u2013 <b>before</b>\n<b>\n</b>you engage in any activity, related to the situation.\nYour manager, in consultation with you, Human Resources and L&amp;BA, will determine what measures should be taken to resolve it appropriately.\nSuch measures typically include recusing yourself from any decision relating to the matter.\nIf you are unsure, but have questions, get help from your manager, Human Resources, L&amp;BA, or the Society\u2019s Ethics Officer.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>EXAMPLES</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of conflicts of interest.\nThey are illustrative, not exhaustive, and are intended to enhance your ability to spot potential conflicts, and ask questions so they may be resolved appropriately:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An employee selects a supplier where the employee\u2019s spouse is an owner, partner, director or officer of the supplier, or otherwise has a financial stake in the supplier\u2019s business.</li>\n<li>An employee negotiates an agreement on behalf of the Society with a business partner</li>\n<li>An employee approves a grant application by a family member without disclosing the relationship to a higher-level manager and seeking guidance as required.</li>\n<li>An employee oversees grant fulfillment activities of a grantee organization for which the employee serves as a board member.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GIFTS AND GRATUITIES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Staff members may not receive any gift worth more than $100 from any person or organization doing business with National Geographic Society.\nStaff members involved in purchasing decisions must take extra care to avoid any gifts that might affect, or appear to affect, their decision-making responsibilities on behalf of National Geographic Society.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Corruption and Bribery\u2014Strictly Prohibited<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you think that an improper payment has been solicited, offered or made, you must report it promptly to the Ethics Officer or another contact listed on the last page of the Code<b>.</b>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every country we work in has laws against corruption and bribery.\nWe take compliance with these laws seriously.\nAs a U.S.-based organization, National Geographic Society focuses particular attention on the anti-bribery standards of the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA).</p>\n<p>We may not offer, promise, pay, give or approve any bribe, kickback or other inducement in the form of cash or anything else of value (such as gifts, travel, entertainment, charitable contributions) to any person or organization, with the intent to exert improper influence over the recipient, induce the recipient to violate their duty of loyalty, secure an improper advantage for National Geographic Society, or improperly reward the recipient for past conduct.\n<b>Nor</b>\n<b>\n</b>\n<b>may we allow any third-party representative (such as a customs clearance brokers, independent contractors, consultants, business partners, or anyone else) to do so on our behalf.</b>\n</p>\n<p>Our Anti-Corruption policy sets standards that must be followed in our relationships with Explorers, Fellows, Grantees, Third-Party Representatives, Field Workers (\u201cfixers\u201d), Exhibitors and recipients of charitable donations.\nAdditionally, there are special standards that apply to our interactions with government officials (including travel, accommodations, meals and entertainment).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Demonstrate Business and Financial Integrity<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We rely on the generosity of individuals and organizations that support our mission<b>.\n</b>We take our obligation for responsible business and financial stewardship very seriously<b>.</b>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>RESPONSIBLE USE OF ASSETS AND EXPENDITURES&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The responsible expenditure of financial resources, and use of National Geographic Society\u2019s assets, is essential to the Society\u2019s sound management, maintenance of our reputation, and the continuing confidence of our donors and partners.</p>\n<p>To ensure that our financial statements properly reflect our assets, liabilities and transactions the financial records each staff member submits must be complete, accurate and understandable.\nThis includes the information each of us</p>\n<p>provides in payroll documents, time cards, travel and expense reports, purchasing, and every other National Geographic Society financial record.\nThe key principles you must follow in your business dealings, expenditures and record keeping include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Act ethically, professionally and responsibly at all times handling NGS resources (funds, trademarks and other property).</li>\n<li>Be conservative when spending National Geographic Society\u2019s money.</li>\n<li>Be accurate, thorough and truthful in your business records.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS CONDUCT&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All contracts with third parties (such as independent contractors, consultants, vendors, suppliers, business partners and others) must be approved by L&amp;BA in advance of National Geographic Society doing business with the third party, and a contract must be in place before work begins.\nNo contractual agreement will be considered valid and enforceable by the National Geographic Society in the absence approval.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Respect for intellectual property, including copyrights and trademarks owned by National Geographic Society and others, is critically important to us.\nEach of us is responsible for ensuring that these rights are upheld.\nYou must contact L&amp;BA in order to obtain a license, or other appropriate clearance, prior to using any intellectual property in your work on behalf of the Society.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We comply with all U.S.\ngovernment trade sanctions.\nThese sanctions may prohibit or restrict travel to certain countries, business activities (such as grants, contracts, collaborations) involving certain countries, nationals, entities or individuals and items (such as laptops, smart phones, technical equipment) that may be exported to certain countries.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Professional Conduct<p>\n</p>\n<p>We are proud of our professional and congenial work environment.\nWe are firmly committed to ensuring it remains productive, engaging and respectful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Use I.T.\nSystems Reponsibly<p>\n</p>\n<p>Each of us is responsible for protecting National Geographic Society\u2019s information technology systems (including our computer network, hardware, software and all related applications).\nWe must do our part to protect these systems from damage, alteration, theft, fraud, misuse and unauthorized access.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Media Inquiries and Social Media<p>\n</p>\n<p>The Communications Team is exclusively responsible for handling all media inquiries concerning the Society as well as overseeing the creation and use of National Geographic Society sponsored social media.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Lobbying and Political Activities<p>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic Society may engage in specific, limited lobbying in the U.S., and internationally, in support of our mission.\nThe Society must document its lobbying activities and confine them to acceptable levels in order to maintain the Society\u2019s status as a tax exempt, not- for-profit organization.\nThe Society may not engage in any type of political campaign activity.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Addressing Concerns and Reporting Violations<p>\n</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each of us shares the privilege and responsibility of upholding the Society\u2019s reputation<b>.\n</b>You do this each time you act ethically and legally<b>.</b>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>OPEN DOOR</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We recognize that there are situations in which making the right decision can be challenging.\nBy raising concerns, sooner rather than later, you give National Geographic Society the opportunity to resolve issues that might otherwise be damaging to our mission and reputation.</p>\n<p>Many of these issues can best be resolved in consultation with your manager, or the next higher level of your management.\nAll managers are responsible for maintaining an \u201copen door\u201d to staff.\nAlternatively, you may contact Human Resources, L&amp;BA or the Society\u2019s Ethics Officer.\nWe are here to support you doing the right thing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>REPORTING POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you believe that a violation of law, our Code of Ethics or policies may have occurred, or is going to occur, you are affirmatively obligated to report it immediately.\nWhile we hope you feel comfortable discussing it with your manager, we recognize that there may be times when you prefer to use another avenue for addressing an issue.\nYou should feel comfortable reporting the issue to any one of the following:&nbsp.\nyour next level manager, Human Resources, L&amp;BA, the Society\u2019s Ethics Officer, the President &amp.\nCOO, the CEO or any member of the Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p>As an additional avenue for reporting actual and potential violations, National Geographic Society offers an external Helpline available to you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\nThe Helpline is operated by an independent third party who specializes in these services.\nYou may submit an email, web-based or automated phone report, and you have the option of speaking to a trained customer service representative who will listen to your concern.\nYou may contact the external helpline at (888) 647-0647 (888-NGS-0-NGS), or EthicsNGS@getintouch.com, or www.intouchwebsite.com/NGS .</p>\n<p>Reports to the helpline can be made anonymously, but we strongly encourage you to identify yourself.\nThis helps ensure your concern is thoroughly considered and appropriately addressed.\nYou can arrange to receive and respond to follow up communications through the helpline even if you choose to be anonymous.\nWe ask that you make these arrangements in order for us to communicate with you about the issue.\nReports are referred to the Ethics Officer for appropriate handling.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>INVESTIGATION AND RESOLUTION&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All reported violations of law, our Code of Ethics or policies will be investigated promptly, objectively and thoroughly.\nNational Geographic Society treats these as confidential internal matters.\nInformation about them is shared only to the extent necessary to investigate and take any corrective action National Geographic Society deems appropriate for resolving the matter consistent with our standards and law.</p>\n<p>Staff members found to have committed violations are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment and possible legal action depending on the violation.</p>\n<p>Similarly, third party representatives, and others acting on our behalf, are subject to having their business relationship with National Geographic Society terminated, and potentially other penalties, for violations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Effective, honest and open communication are indispensable in everything we do for National Geographic Society \u2013 including our efforts to support the timely and effective resolution of potential issues<b>.</b>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>WE DO NOT RETALIATE&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Retaliation against any staff member who reports misconduct is strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated.\nStaff members are expected to seek advice, raise concerns, report potential misconduct in good faith and cooperate with the investigative process.\nThis is critical because silence hurts us when it comes to ethics and compliance.</p>\n<p>If you feel you have been retaliated against for making a good faith report, be sure to contact one of the resources listed on the last page of the Code.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Additional Expectations for Managers<p>\n</p>\n<p>Managers have a special responsibility to model our Code of Ethics with words backed up by actions that set a strong example for all to follow, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never ignore illegal behavior, Code of Ethics violations, policy violations or other conduct that does not meet our high expectations for ethical and lawful conduct;</li>\n<li>Ensure that the staff and third parties you manage are familiar with our Code of Ethics, and understand the importance of our strong ethical and compliance culture;</li>\n<li>Create a work environment where staff feel comfortable discussing our Code of Ethics, and speaking up when they have concerns;</li>\n<li>Promptly escalate concern about a potential violation of law, our Code of Ethics or policies to L&amp;BA.</li>\n<li>Never retaliate against a staff member who reports a concern about suspected or actual misconduct, or tolerate retaliation by anyone else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Certification<p>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic Society requires staff members and Trustees to certify compliance with the Code of Ethics, policies and applicable laws annually.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>Contact Information<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HUMAN RESOURCES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Mara Dell, Chief Human Resources

change the world and our coverage of environmental and social issues has committed us to conducting our business as sustainably and responsibly as possible both in our direct actions and in our impacts through our suppliers, licensees, affiliates, and partners.</p>\n<p>National Geographic Society asks that employees, suppliers, licensees, affiliates, and partners use this Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Policy as a guiding principle in the production and distribution of any National Geographic-branded products or services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Corporate Responsibility Statement <p>National Geographic activities and services will be legally and ethically conducted&nbsp;by&nbsp;treating&nbsp;employees, environments, and cultures with respect.\nWe will&nbsp;minimize negative environmental&nbsp;impacts and greenhouse gas emissions by seeking local, organic, and sustainably-sourced&nbsp;resources, using recycled and recyclable content when possible, and minimizing waste of energy,&nbsp;water, food, and other resources.\nAll products used in National Geographic activities and&nbsp;services should follow the same high standards as National Geographic branded products.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Transparency Pledge <p>National Geographic pledges to conduct its corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts&nbsp;with transparency and openness.\nWe expect our suppliers to conduct their business in the same&nbsp;way and require that they provide us with any relevant information as a condition of doing&nbsp;business with us.\nWe pledge that our records on our sustainability efforts will be open, auditable, and certified where possible.\nWe commit to being science-based in our approach and to making&nbsp;decisions based on the best information available to us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Product and Service Guidelines <p>National Geographic products and services should always aim to be of the highest quality&nbsp;to engage consumers and members in our efforts to care for our living planet, explore new frontiers, reveal our human story, and protect critical species.\nThe National Geographic Society will always seek to give back to the communities and environments that enjoy and help create National Geographic products and services.\nWe embrace customer and employee feedback to help us continually improve our offerings.</p>\n<p>Because the National Geographic Society is committed to conducting our business as sustainably and responsibly as possible, we seek to minimize the negative impacts of our activities, products, and services.\nWe&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;our suppliers, affiliates and partners to do the same.</p>\n<p>National Geographic branded products should be legally and ethically produced with active concern for the people involved in the manufacture and distribution as well as for the environment from which the materials originate.\nManufacturing processes should be&nbsp;clean and&nbsp;efficient, minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and minimizing waste of energy, water, and resources - including the time of employees.\nRecycled and recyclable content should be used whenever feasible.\nWhen virgin materials are necessary, they will be legally and sustainably sourced and their extraction should be done with the utmost care and attention to the impacts&nbsp;on the environment.\nPaper should come from certified forestry sources, never from old-growth or high-conservation-value designated forests, and should never be bleached with elemental chlorine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Environmental Impacts <p>National Geographic products, activities, and services should be designed or conducted in such a way as to minimize negative environmental impacts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To combat global climate change, National Geographic's primary environmental focus is to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for which it is responsible.\nWe have made a commitment to identify and measure both the GHG we emit directly and the GHG that our business partners emit on our behalf.\nWe are committed to reducing our impact immediately and exploring opportunities to mitigate our emissions going forward.\nTo that end, we measure and take steps to reduce:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our use of electricity, natural gas, and water.</li>\n<li>Our waste, which is reused, recycled, or composted as much as possible to divert it from the landfill.</li>\n<li>The emissions of all of our buildings and rental office space.</li>\n<li>The emissions of our business travel.</li>\n<li>The emissions associated with our products, including magazines, books, catalogs, direct mail, CDs, DVDs, films, digital media, and the activities and services we provide, such as travel programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know that National Geographic products, activities, and services all come with some emissions burden, so for emissions we cannot eliminate we seek independently audited and certified carbon offsets, including projects supporting the work of our Explorers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Reuse, Recycling, and Composting</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We make a concerted effort to reduce all types of waste in our operations.\nFor the waste we do produce, we believe in reusing all that we can and recycling or composting that which cannot be reused.\nNational Geographic facilities manage assets in a manner consistent with best practices, all local, state and federal regulations and the U.S.\nGreen Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy &amp.\nEnvironmental Design (LEED) requirements.\nWhen buying office or building supplies, we seek materials made from recycled products when feasible.\nTo ensure that office and building materials are reused, recycled, and composted efficiently and properly, employees of the National Geographic Society are asked to abide by&nbsp;NGS Reuse, Recycling, Compost, and Disposal Procedures.&nbsp;We encourage these same practices in our tenants, customers, suppliers, licensees, affiliates, and partners and encourage the reuse and recycling of our products when our customers have finished with them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Energy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We measure, manage, and reduce energy use at National Geographic facilities in order to create more efficient and safer workplaces as well as to maintain the performance of our headquarters as United States Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design - Existing Buildings (LEED-EB) Gold Certified and Energy Star rated.\nTo do so, we need the help of all employees in our buildings, and therefore ask them to abide by our&nbsp;Energy Policy for National Geographic Headquarters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Travel</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We encourage sustainable business travel practices in our operations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the most fuel-efficient, low-emission, and economical transportation.</li>\n<li>Combining multiple tasks into one trip.</li>\n<li>Using mass transit in lieu of taxis or rental cars.</li>\n<li>Sharing vehicles among as many travelers as practical.</li>\n<li>Staying in&nbsp;LEED- or green-certified hotels when possible.</li>\n<li>Travel only when absolutely necessary.</li>\n<li>Teleconferencing, videoconferencing and using web-based communications tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Supplier, Licensee, Affiliate, and Partner Resource Use</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To share the world and all that is in it, the National Geographic Society licenses its trademarks and the intellectual property content of its magazines, special issues, books and other publications to various international media companies.\nNational Geographic is committed to working with its suppliers, licensees, affiliates, and partners to ensure that their use of resources is sustainable.\nIt is our goal to hold regular meetings with them to review their sustainability policies and encourage them to engage in conservation and efficiency measures for their water and energy use, to increase the utilization of renewable energy sources, and to minimize waste.</p>\n<p>We expect all our suppliers, licensees, affiliates, partners, and their third-party manufacturers to use clean manufacturing processes in the creation of NG-branded products.</p>\n<p>We select supply partners who practice clean manufacturing and demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement in pollution prevention and source reduction that meets or exceeds legal requirements, so as to minimize the environmental impact of their operations on our air, water and climate.</p>\n<p>Our suppliers are expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Measure and reduce their GHG emissions.</li>\n<li>Strive to reduce their environmental impact on an ongoing basis.</li>\n<li>Reduce their use of energy in the operation of their business where possible.</li>\n<li>Use alternative renewable energy sources where practical.</li>\n<li>Demonstrate that they have an active recycling program</li>\n<li>Have an active, ongoing training program in which their employees are encouraged to participate.</li>\n<li>Commit to using recycled-content products where practical as part of their materials-sourcing practice.</li>\n<li>Maximize their use of recycled fiber where practical and possible.</li>\n<li>Use only legally sourced and, where possible, certified raw materials in their operations.</li>\n<li>Subscribe to and participate in credible chain-of-custody certification programs for renewable resources.</li>\n<li>Certify that their programs are or can be third-party audited, and that such audits are conducted regularly with senior management signoff.</li>\n<li>Comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and permits.</li>\n<li>In the case of paper suppliers, ensure all paper is elemental chlorine free, and this must be documentable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Clean Manufacturing</em>\n</p>\n<p>Suppliers who provide manufacturing services to the Society are expected to follow&nbsp;Resource Efficiency and Cleaner Productionprinciples as defined in the&nbsp;United Nations Environmental Program&nbsp;(UNEP) - including such measures as pollution prevention, source reduction, waste minimization, eco efficiency, awareness of and reduction in the use of hazardous materials, reuse of waste, process modification - as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Operate their plants using best available and cost-effective technology to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and permits.</li>\n<li>Share their environmental performance data with us on a regular basis to demonstrate compliance with all operating permits and regulations.</li>\n<li>Use renewable energy where possible and practical, instead of relying on fossil fuels.</li>\n<li>Review with us their environmental performance and practices as requested.</li>\n<li>Identify any hazardous substances used in their operation and work to phase these out where possible.</li>\n<li>Disseminate information related to hazardous material use to employees and the surrounding community in a transparent way, and engage them in decision making in the use of these materials.</li>\n<li>Dispose of toxic waste in accordance with the law and best practices, making every effort to ensure these materials are not dispersed into the environment.</li>\n<li>Account for all manufacturing waste, and recycle all recyclables.</li>\n<li>Strive for continuous improvement in reducing waste and enhancing the quality of their product.</li>\n<li>Maximize the loading of trucks leaving their plant with our product, to minimize fuel consumption and emissions.</li>\n<li>Promote these values among their employees.</li>\n<li>Comply with all applicable local laws and regulations in the countries where they operate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Paper Sourcing</em>\n</p>\n<p>Sustainability is about reducing our carbon emissions as well as making sure we and our business partners protect the environment.\nOur biggest impact in that regard relates to the manufacture of paper for our magazines and books, which affects both air- and water-borne emission at the site of the paper mill.</p>\n<p>In respect to sustainable paper sourcing, we therefore seek to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Minimize paper consumption.</li>\n<li>Eliminate all paper products containing irresponsibly or illegally harvested fibers.</li>\n<li>Maximize the use of recycled fiber sourced from legally certified operations and use it where practical and possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect all suppliers, licensees, affiliates, partners, and their third-party manufacturers to use paper made only from legally sourced wood and to refrain from using wood sourced from old growth or internationally recognized high-conservation-value forests as well as forests that have been designated unique ecosystems or officially designated as containing an endangered species.\nWe expect their paper procurement policies to support the general goals of environmentally sustainable fiber use, reducing pollution and conserving natural resources through recycling and waste reduction.</p>\n<p>We expect our paper suppliers to ensure their operations are compliant with all federal and state laws and regulations, that their forest management practices and harvesting conform to internationally recognized and accepted certification programs, that they monitor and report their air and water effluent, and that they are transparent in this activity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No paper supplied to us may be bleached with elemental chlorine.</li>\n<li>Our paper suppliers are expected to certify their own forest holdings and encourage their suppliers to pursue certification.</li>\n<li>Our paper suppliers are expected to replant forestland or encourage self-propagation of indigenous trees as quickly as possible.</li>\n<li>Our paper suppliers are expected to use best forest management practices, as described by one of the certifiers listed in the \"Forestry Certification\" section below, on the forests they own, lease or buy from.</li>\n<li>We work with the forest industry to ensure we understand the regulations, and that our suppliers abide by them.</li>\n<li>We stay current on international certification protocols.</li>\n<li>We work with certification agents and will support their certification efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Forestry Certification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic supports the growth of forest certification worldwide while protecting the rights of indigenous people and ensuring the protection and preservation of unique stands.</p>\n<p>We recognize the following forestry certifications:&nbsp;Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification&nbsp;(PEFC);&nbsp;Forest Stewardship Council&nbsp;(FSC);&nbsp;Sustainable Forestry Initiative&nbsp;(SFI);&nbsp;American Tree Farm System&nbsp;(ATFS).\nand&nbsp;Canadian Standards Association&nbsp;(CSA), which set standards for how forests are managed, harvested and replanted.\nAll subscribe to a chain of custody for tracking the fiber through the manufacturing and use cycle.\nNational Geographic strives to buy only certified paper products.\nAll Society magazines and catalogs printed in the United States are printed on 100% PEFC-certified paper.\nWhile FSC is currently the most widely recognized forest certification in the U.S., we recognize all of the above certifications.\nOur goal is to have 100% of the fiber used on other National Geographic-produced printed products certified by at least one of the above certifiers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recycled Fiber</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic believes the best way to meet the world's growing demand for paper is to recycle as much as possible and, where possible and practical, to make new products from recovered fiber.\nThe use of recycled fiber must meet the requirements of the end product, which, in the case of our magazines and books, is, firstly, to have the requisite print quality to reproduce faithfully the spectacular images our photographers capture.\nsecondly, the strength needed to run through a high-speed web press.\nand, thirdly, the affordability to keep our products price competitive.\nWe are committed to testing the use of recovered fiber in our products so as to establish the proper balance of the above three conditions, with the goal of incorporating as high a percentage of recycled fiber as possible in our products.\nNational Geographic already specifies high-recycled content in many of its products and supplies, including copier paper, cartons and packaging, book cover materials and packaging materials for DVDs, CDs and catalog products.</p>\n<p>We work with our suppliers to implement the philosophy of reduce, reuse and recycle in developing packaging for the products that we source.\nOur goal is to make packaging materials and products from recycled fiber where possible, to minimize the amount of packaging, to make that packaging as recyclable as possible (minimizing or eliminating non-recyclable components) and to actively encourage the recycling of the package.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Materials</em>\n</p>\n<p>Our goal is to source and use only materials that are certified to be legally secured, sustainably harvested or manufactured, made without use of illegal or forced labor, and traded freely on the open market.\nWe especially look for materials that are sustainably made, manufactured using renewable materials and renewable energy, are recyclable and have the lowest environmental impact.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The Lacey Act</em>\n</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Lacey Act&nbsp;makes it illegal to import illegally sourced plants or animals (forest products included) into the United States, and makes it illegal to import products made from illegally sourced plants or animals.\nNational Geographic requires its suppliers to abide by all the requirements and conditions of the Lacey Act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> SOCIAL IMPACTS <p>National Geographic products, activities, and services should be designed, produced, or conducted with deliberate consideration for the social impacts of their creation and use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Product and Employee Safety</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our suppliers must comply with all applicable local laws and regulations for product and employee safety in the countries where they operate.\nOur U.S.\nsuppliers must comply with all regulations of the&nbsp;Consumer Product Safety Commission&nbsp;(CPSC) and the&nbsp;Occupational Safety and Health Act&nbsp;(OSHA).\nThe materials they use, including adhesives, pigments, inks, coatings, solvents, substrates, curing processes and packaging, must meet the standards for toxicity established by the CPSC or the lowest threshold established by any of the 50 states, whichever is stricter.</p>\n<p>All our suppliers are expected to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Safeguard their employees from exposure to toxic materials and injury, and provide safe working conditions.</li>\n<li>Conduct their business with an emphasis on reducing industrial accidents.</li>\n<li>Use non-toxic cleaning supplies wherever possible, as well as non-toxic printing and binding materials.</li>\n<li>Be open, transparent and fair.\nMinimize waste, maximize the use of renewable energy, reduce the carbon emissions of their operations and promote these values among their employees.</li>\n<li>Comply with all applicable local laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Human Rights and Ethics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic supports the&nbsp;10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact&nbsp;based on&nbsp;The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,&nbsp;the&nbsp;International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the&nbsp;Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the&nbsp;United Nations Convention Against Corruption.\nWe:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.</li>\n<li>Ensure that we and our business partners and suppliers are not complicit in human rights abuses.</li>\n<li>Uphold the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.</li>\n<li>Uphold the elimination of forced and compulsory labor and require the same from our business partners.</li>\n<li>Support the abolition of child labor and require companies that we work with to comply with the \u201cNo Child Labor\u201d policy set forth in this document.</li>\n<li>Eliminate discrimination in employment and occupation.\nNational Geographic\u2019s policy requires that we observe all applicable laws governing fair employment practices.\nEmployment decisions are made without regard to age, race, color, religion, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability, as well as other classifications protected by federal, state, District of Columbia, or local laws.</li>\n<li>Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.</li>\n<li>Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility.</li>\n<li>Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.</li>\n<li>Work against corruption in all forms, including extortion and bribery by complying with the Anti-Corruption Policy and Compliance Manual.&nbsp.\nWe follow all applicable national, state, local laws and regulations and require companies that we work with to do the same.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Compliance <p>Violation of this policy may, in NGS\u2019s sole discretion, result in the termination of our business relationship with a Licensee, Affiliate, Partner, or Supplier.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> No Child Labor Policy <p>Any supplier that National Geographic works with shall comply in all respects with the No Child Labor Policy set out below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, child labor is defined as the employment, whether paid or unpaid, of any child under the age of fifteen (15) in any position where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The child is kept from attending school and receiving the education they will need to succeed in life.\nWork shall never come at the expense of a child\u2019s education.\nIn no case shall a child be granted full-time employment before completing the minimum number of years of mandatory schooling, as determined by national Law.</li>\n<li>The child is exposed to dangerous pesticides, fumes, toxins, chemicals, or carcinogens, or an environment that is unsanitary.</li>\n<li>National or international laws relating to human rights or working children are violated.\nIn particular, national laws stipulating a minimum working age that exceeds the fifteen (15) years of age required herein must be adhered to.</li>\n<li>The child is required to operate heavy or dangerous machinery that could lead to an accident or otherwise pose a risk to his/her safety.\nHeavy or dangerous machinery shall only be operated by adults age eighteen (18) and older.</li>\n<li>The child is required to work more than three (3) hours per day, more than fifteen (15) hours per week, or more than five (5) days per week.</li>\n<li>The child is compelled to work or in any way coerced into completing his/her duties.</li>\n<li>The physical, emotional, psychological, or intellectual development of the child could be jeopardized.</li>\n<li>The child is not being observed or accompanied by a parent, legal guardian, or an adult member of his/her immediate or extended family.\nChildren who perform developmental tasks or vocational apprenticeships at a family workshop are excluded from this definition of \u201cchild laborers\u201d.\nhowever, the tasks must nonetheless in no way interfere with the child\u2019s education, safety, health, or overall well-being (regardless of whether the tasks are paid or not), and will still be held to the same criteria outlined above with the exception of the minimum age requirement of fifteen (15) years of age.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All activities that could be classified as child labor under the definition delineated above are expressly prohibited, and Licensee and any Third-Party Manufacturer agree not to engage in any such activities.&nbsp.\nFurther, NGS shall have the continuing right, in order to enforce this No Child Labor policy and reassure both customers and the general public that no children are being exploited in the creation of any Licensed Products, to periodically inspect Licensee\u2019s and/or any Third-Party Manufacturer\u2019s facilities.&nbsp.\nAdvance notice need not always be provided prior to such inspection, so as to preserve the integrity of the inspection process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> NGS Sustainability Procurement Policy for Suppliers/Manufacturers/Third Parties&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Policy Statement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The National Geographic Society believes in the power of science and storytelling to change the world and our coverage of conservation and sustainability issues has committed us to conducting our business as sustainably as possible, minimizing both our own environmental impact and the environmental impact of our suppliers and partners.&nbsp.\nThat commitment is our assurance to our customers and members that we provide our products and services in a manner that is consistent with the sustainable use of our resources.\nThose who supply paper to National Geographic must demonstrate that the wood fiber used in paper manufacturing comes from sustainably managed sources and is produced using environmentally preferable technologies and processes.</p>\n<p>By providing a clear and well-articulated policy requiring our paper suppliers to document their performance, and by establishing measurable objectives, we, in turn, can assure our customers that the products they purchase from us are made sustainably, using best practices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sustainability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that producers who supply paper and other forest products to National Geographic demonstrate that the wood fiber they use in paper manufacturing comes from forestry sources that are managed in a sustainable manner and are produced using environmentally sound practices and processes.\nOnly suppliers who meet National Geographic\u2019s requirements in this area will be considered as business partners.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recycling</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic strongly supports the recycling of all paper products.\nWe are committed to recycling all waste, and we actively promote the recycling of our products by our members and customers.\nWe are committed to using recycled-content products where doing so makes environmental and economic sense (packaging, tissue, cartons, binders, board, etc.).</p>\n<p>National Geographic also fully supports and promotes the practice of recycling, wherever possible, other products that the Society consumes, in the most practical and safe manner, and we actively promote the use of recycled materials in our operations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clean Manufacturing Process</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic will select supply partners who demonstrate a commitment to continuous improvement in source reduction and pollution prevention that meets or exceeds legal requirements, so as to minimize the environmental impact of paper production on water, air and climate.\nWe encourage our suppliers to pursue energy conservation, to increase the utilization of renewable energy sources, to engage in conservation of electricity and to maximize their energy efficiency.\nFor products that require bleaching and brightening, we will show preference to suppliers that utilize processes that are environmentally responsible.\nThe suppliers must comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and guidelines.</p>\n<p>All paper sourced from North American paper mills must be elemental chlorine free.\nThe supplier is responsible for documenting its conformity with this requirement.</p>\n<p>We also require continuous improvement for key indicators of water quality, water use and air emissions, including greenhouse gases.\nWe require our suppliers to measure and document such improvements by providing a written report annually.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Certification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic fully supports independent standards and third-party independent verification as a means of measuring supplier performance.\nThe goal is to have National Geographic\u2019s key paper suppliers provide 60 percent of their fiber sourcing certified by at least one of the following sources: FSC, SFI, CSA or PEFC.\nNo paper may be sourced from forests generally accepted as being of high conservation value.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Credible Reporting and Verification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Paper suppliers must make available to National Geographic, on an annual basis, a report that highlights their progress towards waste minimization, sustainable forestry practices, clean manufacturing practices and chain-of-custody compliance.\nAs part of this requirement, all processes and data must be independently verified by a third-party audit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Economic Viability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The desired outcome of our policy is continuous improvement in the environmental impact of the paper industry.\nOur goal is to have a sufficient supply of sustainably produced paper on the market to meet our needs.\nA full, comprehensive and periodic review will be conducted by National Geographic\u2019s senior production and purchasing staff to ensure that the products covered under this policy are being produced sustainably, while not jeopardizing the delivery of finished products.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Continuous Improvement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic recognizes that responsible environmental stewardship is a continuous process.\nWe will engage our paper suppliers in an ongoing dialogue to monitor their performance and to remain informed about opportunities to become increasingly sustainable.\nNational Geographic further challenges our partners to develop new grades of quality paper that offer products that meet the highest environmental standards suitable for use in our products.\nTo this end, National Geographic will give preference to companies that practice and encourage sustainable forest management, that run lower carbon-emitting operations and that strive for continuous improvement in their operations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Explanation of Terms</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Forest</em>\n</p>\n<p>An extensive, uninterrupted, naturally occurring stand, most commonly marked by a mix of species and range of ages of trees and undergrowth.\nIt is a bio-diverse ecosystem able to sustain a variety of both simple and complex flora and fauna in a constantly self-renewing cycle.\nIt is comprised of all ages of plants and animals, including decomposing flora and fauna, which together constitute and contribute to the biomass needed to nurture regeneration.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sustainable Forestry</em>\n</p>\n<p>Managing forest harvesting in such a way as to allow a forest to replace itself with the full range of native species, to maturity, over a specified area so as to have a continuous yield of mature trees on an ongoing basis and at a constant rate.\nIn order for forestry to be truly sustainable, enough new trees need to be planted so that enough mature trees are available to meet the demands of the world\u2019s growing population.</p>\n<p>The goal of forest regeneration must be to replicate what is burned or harvested over time.\nThe regeneration of a forest ecosystem should be achieved, where possible, by natural processes, such as self-seeding and preservation of a critical number of original native species, or through the use of accepted forest management techniques, thereby allowing for the complete natural regeneration of an original forest ecosystem to full maturity of all species.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Tree Farms</em>\n</p>\n<p>National Geographic recognizes the important role and value of tree farming and the growing of trees as a source of timber and paper fiber.\nHowever, we do not consider a single-species monoculture planted for the specific purpose of being a fiber or timber crop and managed to eliminate all other competing species through the use of pesticides, herbicides and under-story burning to be a forest ecosystem.\nSuch plantations are characterized by the lack of under-story or secondary species, and do not support a full range of flora and fauna typical for a forest setting at a given latitude or altitude.\nFurthermore, such a crop stand does not provide the essential water-purification function of a forest, so while it provides for essential fiber production, it is not a forest and should not be counted as a forest.</p> ", "created_at": "2019-08-08 07:04:52.468365", "updated_at": "2019-08-08 07:04:55.549256"}], "points": [{"id": 7765, "title": "You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the
