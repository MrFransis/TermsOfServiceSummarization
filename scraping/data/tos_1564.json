to submit messages through the MeWe Service is never recommended.\nOnce we receive your transmission of information, MeWe makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.\nHowever, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.\nIf MeWe learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nMeWe may post a notice on the MeWe Site

our production servers as soon as is technically possible based on our infrastructure design&nbsp;including a 30-day delay to insure the deletion request was made by you, etc.&nbsp;The more data you delete, the longer will the deletion process take&nbsp;due to load balancing protections on our servers.&nbsp;After we\u2019ve deleted your Content Data from our production servers, that same data may remain in our backups for a limited period of time (maximum of 7 months) due to protection regulations and our protocols for backup content protection.\nWe secure your data that temporarily remains on our backups with additional security protocols.\nIf we ever need to restore our backups into the main servers of MeWe (in a rare instance, for example recovering from a natural disaster), if any of your Content Data you have previously deleted from our main servers is still on our backups in that moment, it will be deleted prior to or right after the backups are moved to the main servers.&nbsp;If you own a group and delete your account, the content you posted to that group will be deleted.\nhowever, the group(s) you own will not be deleted unless you are the only member of that group.</p> MeWe Secret Chat <p>MeWe offers Secret Chat as an option for MeWe users.\nMeWe has no way to decrypt Secret Chat messages of MeWe users because the messages are end-to-end encrypted

successfully.\nHeader information of MeWe Secret Chat messages (sender, recipient etc.) is protected by an additional encryption layer for transmission to the server, and from the server to the recipient, to prevent eavesdropping by third parties (e.g.\nin open wireless LANs).</p> MeWe Invitations and \u201cAdd Automatically\u201d <p>You may desire to make it easier for you to find and

Policies</p>Message Disappearance<p>You have the ability to send certain types of messages through our services that automatically disappear.\nIf you send such disappearing messages through our services they will be automatically deleted once they have been viewed or have expired.</p>\n<p>But \u2014 and this is important \u2014 you should understand that users who see your messages can always save them, either by taking a screenshot or by using some other image-capture technology (whether that be software or even something as old-fashioned as a camera to take a photo of your device\u2019s screen).\nThe same common sense that applies to the Internet at large applies to MeWe as well: Don\u2019t send messages that you wouldn\u2019t want someone to save or share.</p>In most cases, once we detect that all recipients have viewed a message, we automatically delete it from our servers.\nAnd again in most cases, the services are programmed to delete the message from the recipients\u2019 device as well.\nThere are, however, exceptions to this general rule:<ul>\n<li>We can\u2019t guarantee that messages will be deleted within a specific timeframe.\nAnd even after we\u2019ve deleted message data from our servers, that same data may remain in backup for a limited period of time.</li>\n<li>We may receive requests from law enforcement requiring us by law to suspend our ordinary server-deletion practices for specific information.</li>\n<li>As with any digital information, there may be ways to access messages while still in temporary storage on recipients\u2019 devices or, forensically, even after they are deleted.</li>\n</ul>Your Identity: We Protect It To The Extent The Law Allows<p>We do our best to protect your identity at all times and we are respectful of the law.\nMeWe will disclose personally-identifying information when required to do so by law.</p>Linking to Third Party Sites: These Are Your Decisions And Responsibilities<p>As an optional convenience for you, MeWe offers you the opportunity to link to and/or connect to third party websites, advertisers, vendor products, services, etc., including and not limited to social network sites like Twitter.\nWhen you click-through, connect or link to these third party sites, products, services, etc., you are no longer protected by MeWe's Privacy Policy.\nIf you share to any third party social site from MeWe, they will not be able to see back into your MeWe account.\nWe encourage you to read the privacy policies of these third parties, as they differ from MeWe's privacy practices as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nMeWe is not liable for wrongful use, loss, or disclosure of your personally-identifying information related to your use of any third party.</p>Security: HTTPS and Encryption<p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal user data and other information transmitted to us.\nFor example, we encrypt your personally identifiable information, and most, if not all requests from you to the server are created over a secure connection (HTTPS).\nHowever, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>Children's Privacy<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16.\nIf we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under the age of 16, we will delete such information from our records.</p>Notifications: We\u2019d Like To Keep You Up To Date<p>If you are a registered user of MeWe you may receive notifications and updates while using our service.\nAdditionally, if you have supplied your email address, MeWe may want to tell you about new features,

notifications.</p>Privacy Policy Changes: Immediate Notification &amp.\nEasy Opt Out<p>If MeWe changes any aspect of its Privacy Policy, we will notify you with a link to the changes so you can review
