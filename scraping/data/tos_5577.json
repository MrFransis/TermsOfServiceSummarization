data\n<p>Visitor comments are checked through an automated spam detection service (Akismet Anti-Spam).</p>\n<p>Akismet collects information about visitors who comment.\nThe information it collects includes the commenter\u2019s IP address, user agent, referrer, and site URL (along with other information directly provided by the commenter such as their name, username, email address, and the comment itself).</p>\n<p>Visitors are checked through an automated firewall (WordFence), which will collect your IP, location, and internet operator.\nHowever, we only check this information if WordFence sends a spam alert or website breach-related to the IP, which is rare since the IP blocking in the circumstances above is an automated feature.</p>\n<p>We also use reCaptcha.\nReCAPTCHA helps websites and mobile apps prevent spam and block \u201cbots.\u201d The program determines whether the user is a real person or a \u201cbot\u201d to stop \u201cautomated software\u201d from weighing down your site.</p>\n<p>ReCAPTCHA works by implementing an algorithm to analyze a user\u2019s activity by taking a user\u2019s browser window screenshot.\nIf the activity is deemed as mechanical or a made-up word is used, the activity is flagged by the system.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Activity and user information reCAPTCHA collects and analyzes the following</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Typing patterns of the user</li>\n<li>The amount of mouse clicks a user has done on the site or touches on an app</li>\n<li>What language the user\u2019s browser is using</li>\n<li>Google cookies that have been placed on the site</li>\n<li>The answers to question fields on the site</li>\n<li>CSS information</li>\n<li>Plug-ins installed on the browser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The algorithm also recognizes IP addresses that have been previously recognized as humans through cookies.</p>\n<p>We use the version V3.\n<strong>ReCAPTCHA v3</strong> doesn\u2019t rely on users clicking checkboxes or pictures.\nThe version 3 collects and analyzes the interactions a user has with a site to create a <strong>score</strong>.\nThe final score indicates whether the activity is suspicious.\nThis version decreases \u201c<strong>user friction</strong>\u201d by doing away with questions and creating a seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>Registered users are also checked through the services above.</p>\nYour contact information\n<p>Any contact about your data should be done to reb@rbarata.com</p>\nAdditional information\n<ul>\n<li>We do not receive data from third parties.</li>\n<li>We are hosted in wordpress.com, which provides all automated security and spam options.\nWe also have an additional firewall and security software.\n(WordFence)</li>\n<li>In case of any breach, we will contact the registered users at the email address provided.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t use any automatic user data management.</li>\n<li>The way your data can be registered/sent is also dependent on the plugins or other applications that you may have installed or operated in conjunction with your browser or equipment, which we are not responsible for and can not predict.\nSo, please use tracker blockers, VPN, or any other privacy tools in your browser that will protect you from it.\nHowever, be aware
