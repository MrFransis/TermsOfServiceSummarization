You are now read Hi! You are now reading Padlet's Terms of Service, meaning the contract between you and Padlet when you use Padlet's site, services, and products.\nYou should read this carefully before you use Padlet.\nWe've tried to be fair and straightforward.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to email us.\nWe've also included several annotations ( <em>in italics</em>).\nthese annotations aren't a part of the contract itself, but are intended to help you follow the text and emphasize key sections.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>1.\nAccepting the Terms of Service&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Please read these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines (collectively, the \"Agreement\") carefully before using Padlet.com (the \"Site\") and/or the other domains, products, services, and/or content provided by Wallwisher, Inc.\n(all of those collectively with the Site, the \"Services\") (Wallwisher, Inc., a Delaware corporation, collectively with its agents, consultants, employees, officers and directors, \"Padlet,\" \"we,\" or \"us\").\nBy using or accessing the Services, you (\"Subscriber\" or \"you\") agree to become bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\nIf you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn't and aren't permitted to use the Services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>2.\nModifications to this Agreement&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Padlet reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Agreement at any time by posting a revised Agreement through the Services and by providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed, generally via e-mail where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification in your Padlet Profile).\nYou are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Agreement.\nModifications are effective when posted, and your use of the Services following any such posted modification and notice of same constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as modified.\nNote that, if you have prepaid for any Paid Services (as defined below) prior to a modification of this Agreement, your use of such prepaid Paid Services is governed by the version of this Agreement in effect at the time Padlet received your prepayment.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>As Padlet grows and improves, we might have to make changes to the Terms of Service.\nWhen we do, we'll let you know.\nStarting with this version, we're also going to make it a practice to post old versions so it's easy to see changes/additions/deletions.<br>\n</em>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>3.\nUse of the Services&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>Can kids use Padlet? </strong>Of course, but Padlet is not currently directed to children and we expect that use by children will only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.\nFurther, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.\nIn the United States, if you are the sponsor of a Sponsored Group (the \u201cSponsor\u201d), including a School that is using Padlet, that includes children under the age of 13, you (or your school) assumes the responsibility for complying with the U.S.\nChildren's Online Privacy Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d).\nThis means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Service the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Service.\nSchools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians.\nFor more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm.\nIf you are outside of the United States, please ensure that you are complying with any laws applicable to you before submitting any child\u2019s personal information or permitting any child to submit personal information to us.\nIf a school outside the United States wants to enable its students to use Padlet, Padlet will work with such schools on case by case basis to ensure compliance with any applicable laws regarding the collection of information from minors.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Service Changes and Limitations: </strong>The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to you.\nPadlet retains the right to create limits on and related to use of the Services in its sole discretion at any time with or without notice.\nPadlet may also impose limits on certain Services or aspects of those Services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.\nPadlet may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content (as defined below).\nPadlet may also suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>This section makes it clear that Padlet is an ever-evolving platform.\nWith new products, services, and features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings (like features that flop).\nWe can also suspend any individual account at any time.\nThat sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>\n<strong>Limitations on Automated Use: </strong>You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (a) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, or the computer or delivery systems of Padlet and/or its service providers.\n(b) probe, scan, or test any system or network (particularly for vulnerabilities), or otherwise attempt to breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures.\n(c) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Padlet (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Padlet, or unless permitted by Padlet's robots.txt file or other robot exclusion mechanisms.\n(d) scrape the Services, and particularly scrape Content (as defined below) from the Services, without Padlet's express prior written consent.\n(e) use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information, including without limitation by forging TCP-IP packet headers or e-mail headers.\nor (f) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any Subscriber, host or network, including, without limitation, by sending a virus to, spamming, or overloading the Services, or by scripted use of the Services in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>Don't do bad things to Padlet or other users.\nSome particularly egregious examples of automated \"bad things\" are listed in this section.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>4.\nRegistration, Padlet URLs, and Security&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>As a condition to using certain of the Services, you may be required to create an account (an \" <strong>Account</strong>\") and select a password and Padlet username.\nYou may also select new Padlet URLs (of the form padlet.com/wall/\u201dexample\u201d) for each blog you create.\nYou should provide Padlet with accurate, complete, and updated registration information, particularly your e-mail address, and failure to do so may result in suspension of your Account.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>It's really important that the email address associated with your Padlet Account is accurate and up-to-date.\nIf you ever forget your password - or worse, fall victim to a malicious phishing attack - a working email address is often the only way for us to recover your account.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>You agree that you shall not select or use as a Padlet URL a name of another person or entity with the intent to impersonate that person or entity or with the intent to otherwise cause confusion as to the origin or provenance of your Account.\nPadlet reserves the right to refuse registration of, cancel, or modify a Padlet URL in its sole discretion.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>Don't choose a Padlet URL with the intention of impersonating someone/something or otherwise causing confusion about who's behind your blog.\nParody, criticism, and other fair uses of others' names are fine, so long as there's no intention to impersonate or confuse.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify Padlet immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>5.\nPrivacy&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Any information you provide to Padlet is subject to Padlet's&nbsp.\nPrivacy Policy, which governs our collection and use of your information.\nYou understand that through your use of the Services you consent to the collection and use (as set forth in the Privacy Policy) of this information.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>6.\nContent and Subscriber Content&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>\n<strong>Definitions: </strong>For purposes of this Agreement: (1) the term \"Content\" means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photographs, images, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies, and comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files, graphics, and interactive features, any of which may be generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services.\n(2) the term \"Subscriber Content\" is all Content that is posted or otherwise provided or transferred to the Services by a Subscriber (including, without limitation, by you).\nand Content also includes, without limitation, all Subscriber Content.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Ownership</strong>: Subscribers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in their Subscriber Content, and Padlet and/or third parties retain ownership of all intellectual property rights in all Content other than Subscriber Content.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>You retain ownership of any intellectual property you post to Padlet.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>\n<strong>Subscriber Content License to Padlet: </strong>When you transfer Subscriber Content to Padlet through the Services, you give Padlet a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), such Subscriber Content.\nThe rights you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating the Services in accordance with their functionality, improving the Services, and allowing Padlet to develop new Services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>When you upload your creations to Padlet, you grant us a license to make that content available in the ways you'd expect from using our services (for example, via your blog, RSS, the Padlets Dashboard, etc.).\nWe never want to do anything with your content that surprises you.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>\n<em>Something else worth noting: We're thrilled to offer our support as a platform for our creators, and we'd never claim to be entitled to royalties or reimbursement for the success of what you've created.\nIt's your work, and we're proud to be a part (however small) of what you accomplish.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>You also agree that this license includes the right for Padlet to make all publicly-posted Content available to third parties selected by Padlet, so that those third parties can distribute and/or analyze such Content on other media and services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>An example of what it means to \"make all publicly-posted Content available\" to a Padlet partner for distribution or analysis would be if we licensed a feed of already-publicly-available Content to a partner, similar to how Twitter makes feeds available through its Streaming API.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>Note also that this license to your Subscriber Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through the Services - when you post something publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your Content part of a social conversation that cannot later be erased without retroactively censoring the speech of others.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<em>One thing you should consider before posting: When you make something publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to take down all copies of it.&nbsp;<br>\n</em>\n<br>You also agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of others, and represent that you have all of the necessary rights to grant us this license for all Subscriber Content you submit to the Services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Compliance with Community Guidelines: </strong>You agree that you won't post Subscriber Content that violates, or otherwise use your Account in ways that violate, Padlet's Community Guidelines.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Termination and Deletion:</strong> On termination of your Account or upon your deletion of particular pieces of Subscriber Content from the Services, Padlet shall make reasonable efforts to make such Subscriber Content inaccessible and cease use of it.\nhowever, you acknowledge and agree that: (a) caching of, copies of, or references to the Subscriber Content may not be immediately removed.\nand (b) such removed Subscriber Content may persist in backups (not available to others) for a reasonable period of time.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>7.\nUse of Trademarks&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Any use of Padlet's trademarks, branding, logos and other such assets in connection with the Services shall be in accordance with the Padlet&nbsp.\nTrademark Guidelines.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>8.\nWarranty Disclaimer.\nServices Available on an \"AS-IS\" Basis&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" BASIS.\nWITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PADLET DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nPadlet makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to the Services, including any representation or warranty that the use of the Services will (a) be timely, uninterrupted or error-free or operate in combination with any other hardware, software, system or data, (b) meet your requirements or expectations, (c) be free from errors or that defects will be corrected, or (d) be free of viruses or other harmful components.\nPadlet also makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to Content.\nSubscriber Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the responsibility of, the Subscribers providing that Content.\nNo advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from Padlet or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>9.\nRelease From Liability&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>You release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Padlet, its directors, officers, shareholders, employees, representatives, consultants, agents, suppliers, and/or distributors from responsibility, liability, claims, demands, and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the following:&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>Disputes between Subscribers, including those between you and other Subscribers.</li>\n<li>Third party sites and services, including content found on such sites and services.</li>\n<li>Disputes concerning any use of or action taken using your Account by you or a third party.</li>\n<li>Claims relating to the unauthorized access to any data communications or Content stored under or relating to your Account, including unauthorized use or alteration of such communications or your Content.</li>\n<li>Claims relating to in any way to any face-to-face meetings in any way related to Padlet at any venues.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code \u00c2\u00a71542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\"&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>10.\nLimitation of Liability&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PADLET, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR: (A) ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER.\n(B) LOSS OF: PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.\n(C) DAMAGES RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES.\n(D) DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY OR SUBSCRIBER USING THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OR CONTENT.\nAND/OR (E) DAMAGES IN ANY MANNER RELATING TO ANY CONTENT.\nTHIS LIMITATION APPLIES TO ALL CLAIMS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT PADLET HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND FURTHER WHERE A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF PADLET AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, AND/OR DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY DOLLARS (US$50.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE SERVICE(S).&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>11.\nExclusions to Warranties and Limitation of Liability&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion/limitation of liability as set forth in Section 14, so the limitations above may not apply to you.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>12.\nTermination&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time by notifying the other party.\nPadlet may also terminate or suspend your access to or ability to use any and all Services immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to if you breach any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.\nIn particular, Padlet may immediately terminate or suspend Accounts that have been flagged for repeat copyright infringement.\nUpon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease.\nAll provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.\nTermination of your access to and use of the Services shall not relieve you of any obligations arising or accruing prior to such termination or limit any liability which you otherwise may have to Padlet or any third party.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>13.\nLegal Disputes&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>You and Padlet agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Agreement or the Services in accordance with this Section or as you and Padlet otherwise agree in writing.\nBefore resorting to litigation, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Law and Forum for Legal Disputes:</strong> This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California as they apply to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within California between California residents, without regard to conflict of law provisions.\nYou agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Padlet must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties.\nYou agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, San Francisco for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>14.\nMiscellaneous&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>This Agreement, as modified from time to time, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Padlet with respect to the subject matter hereof.\nThis Agreement replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof and constitutes the entire and exclusive agreement between the parties.\nThe failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nThis Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by you except with Padlet's prior written consent.\nPadlet may assign this Agreement in whole or in part at any time without your consent.\nNo agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Padlet in any respect whatsoever.\nAny notice to Padlet that is required or permitted by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon receipt, when delivered in person by nationally recognized overnight courier or mailed by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to Wallwisher, Inc., 175 Acalanes

Padlet's policies and procedures are based on United States law.\nAs such, the following provisions apply specifically to Subscribers located outside of the United States: (1) you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information, including but not limited to Subscriber Content and any personal information, to and in the United States and/or other countries.\nand (2) if you are using the Services from a country embargoed by the United States, or are on the United States Treasury Department's list of \"Specially Designated Nationals,\" you agree that you will not conduct any commercial activities using or through the Services.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<br>16.\nDMCA Copyright Policy&nbsp;<br>\n</strong>\n<br>Padlet has adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement on the Services in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (a copy of which is located at http://www.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf, the \"DMCA\").\nThe address of Padlet's Designated Agent for copyright takedown notices (\"Designated Agent\") is listed below.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Reporting Instances of Copyright Infringement: </strong>If you believe that Content residing or accessible on or through the Services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent at the address below:&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<ol>\n<li>Identification of the work or material being infringed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including its location, with sufficient detail so that Padlet is capable of finding it and verifying its existence.</li>\n<li>Contact information for the notifying party (the \"Notifying Party\"), including name, address, telephone number and e-mail address.</li>\n<li>A statement that the Notifying Party has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or law.</li>\n<li>A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the notice is accurate and that the Notifying Party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>After removing material pursuant to a valid DMCA notice, Padlet will immediately notify the Subscriber responsible for the allegedly infringing material that it has removed or disabled access to the material.\nPadlet reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate the account of any Subscriber who is the subject of repeated DMCA notifications.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Submitting a DMCA Counter-Notification:</strong> If you believe you are the wrongful subject of a DMCA notification, you may file a counter-notification with

counter-notification, Padlet will forward it to Notifying Party who submitted the original DMCA notification.\nThe original Notifying Party (or the copyright holder he or she represents) will then

version (e.g.\nAndroid 8.0)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>browser type and version (e.g.\nChrome 63.0)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>screen size and resolution (e.g.\n375px wide retina screen)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>battery and signal strength (e.g.\n15% battery, 75% signal strength)<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Padlet for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you\u2019ve opted in to receive them.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Related to the Use of the Service <br>\n</strong>We collect information about how people use the Service.\nThis information includes general usage information, and may include information such as the number and frequency of our visitors, which pages or features of the Service they have visited, which links on the Service they have clicked on, and the length of those visits.\n<br>\n<br>We may also use third party applications and services, such as Google Analytics (GA), to collect, analyze, and report this information.\nWe may also use some of this information in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure related to all of our users that would not identify you personally.\n<br>\n<br>We use information about your use of the Service to improve and enhance your experience on the Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Related to Your Location&nbsp;</strong>An IP address is an address assigned to any device connected to the Internet.\nDepending on where you are, your IP address can be unique to your computer, or shared among many devices.\nAn IP address can be used to locate the device it is assigned to, and in turn the user using it.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>When you use the Service, we collect your IP address for:&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>personalization (e.g.\nshowing Portuguese site to Brazilian users)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>analytics (e.g.\nhow many people from France used Padlet today)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>detecting and preventing spam and malware (e.g.\nblocking the IP addresses posting bad links)&nbsp;</li>\n<li>troubleshooting issues with our Service (e.g.\nif users in Chicago are seeing more errors than users in New York, we should investigate our Chicago servers)&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>We do not store your IP address anywhere on our service for longer than 30 days after your visit.\nWe use Google Analytics\u2019 IP anonymization feature to prevent them from associating your activity with your identity.\n(So, GA will only see that someone in San Francisco visited page X, not someone who lives on the corner of 6th St and Mission St.) <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Related to Your Search History <br>\n</strong>We track your search queries on the Service to learn your preferences and improve your search results over time.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information received from

automatically.\nThis may include aggregated anonymous information or certain personal information that may be provided to us.\nIf we receive personal information from third-parties, we will handle it in accordance with this Policy.\nIf we directly combine information we receive from other third-parties with personal information that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as personal information and handle it in accordance with this Policy.<br>\n<br>Local law may require you authorize the third-party to share your information with us before we can acquire it.\nWe do not control, supervise, or respond to how third parties providing your information process your personal information, and any information request regarding the disclosure of your personal information to us should be directed to such third-parties.\n&nbsp.\n<i>more_vert</i> How Long We Retain Information How Long We Retain Information Padlet will keep information for as long as necessary to provide the Service under our Terms and Conditions and other relevant agreements between you and Padlet.\nWe will also retain information so as to fulfil any legal requirement to which we are subject to, e.g.\ntrade, tax, and employment law.\nWe will discard personal information when:&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>the data subject withdraws consent to processing,&nbsp;</li>\n<li>our contractual obligations have been fully performed and cannot be performed to any further extent, or</li>\n<li>the personal information is obsolete.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>We will also not keep any information the processing of which has been objected to, or for which a request for erasure has been made, beyond the legally required timeframe to complete such a request (usually 30 days).&nbsp.\n<i>more_vert</i> Whom Do We Share the Collected Information With? Whom Do We Share the Collected Information With? First and foremost, you should know that Padlet does not sell or rent your personal information to any third-party for any purpose.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>We share information we collect from you under the limited circumstances set forth below: <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Shared With the Public Through the Service <br>\n</strong>All registered users have a public profile (e.g.\nhttps://padlet.com/doodlebug).\nThe profile has the user\u2019s profile photo, name, username, bio, and their public padlets.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>These profiles are accessible to and searchable by all Padlet users.\nThese profiles may also be indexed by search engines like Google and Bing.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>Any content you post on a public padlet is also indexable by search engines and, as such, is open to the public.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Shared With Other Padlet Users Through the Service <br>\n</strong>When you collaborate with other people, they can see your profile photo, name, and username.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Shared With Service Providers in Order to Operate and Improve the Services <br>\n</strong>We work with many vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf.\nThese service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d).\nWe may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions.\nE.g.:&nbsp;<ul>\n<li>We use Help Scout to manage customer support requests.\nWe share your name, your email, and your messages with them.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We use Honeybadger to notify us when a user encounters an error so we can fix it promptly.\nWe share your device information, IP, and email with them.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We use Chargebee to manage billing.\nThey store your name, email, and credit card information.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>We use 30-40 different providers to support our operations.\nThese providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Policy.\nPadlet has also entered into Data Processing Agreements with parties who process data on our behalf or in connection with the use of the Padlet Service.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Shared with Third Parties&nbsp;</strong>We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other de-identified or non-personally identifiable information, with users, partners, press, or other third-parties in order to, for example, demonstrate how Padlet is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for Padlet.\nAny aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information.&nbsp;<br>\n<strong>Information Disclosed to Fulfil Legal Obligations&nbsp;</strong>We may disclose personal information if necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.\nWe may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Padlet, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.\nThis includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to law enforcement and government requests.\n<br>\n<br>Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law.\n(ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon Padlet, or its users.\nIn instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers&nbsp;</strong>Over time, Padlet may grow and reorganize.\nWe may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Policy.\n<br>\n<br>In the event that all or a portion of Padlet or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party.\nThis Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).\nWe will provide you with notice of an acquisition within 30 days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by emailing you on your email address on file.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.\n<br>\n<br>In the unlikely event that Padlet goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third-party.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Shared to Enforce Content Policy&nbsp;</strong>To make sure that all content on Padlet conforms to our content policy, we run all user content, no matter the privacy, through a series of automated checks.\nIf any content is flagged to be in violation of our content policy, an authorized personnel at Padlet may look at it to determine the appropriate action to be taken against that content.\nThis helps us keep the Service safe and appropriate for all users.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information You Share with Third Party Services&nbsp;</strong>You may access Third Party Services through the Service, for example by watching a YouTube video on a padlet.\nYou may also choose to share information that you provide to us with Third Party Services (e.g., by posting your padlet to Twitter or Facebook).\nThese services have their own privacy policies which we don\u2019t govern.\nWe encourage you to review them before providing them with personal information.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Information Shared With Your Consent or at Your Request&nbsp;</strong>Other than the cases above, we will share your information only if we have your consent.&nbsp.\n<i>more_vert</i> Your Rights Your Rights You have the choice to request correction and/or deletion of personal information we process about you as well as to request that we cease communicating with you where we do so on the basis of your consent or previous customer relationship with you.\nIf you are a registered user, you can access and update most information associated with your Account by logging in to the Service and checking your Account Settings page.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Your GDPR Rights <br>\n</strong>Customers based in the European Union or the European Economic

California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents have the right to request from us a list of all third parties to which we have disclosed personal information during the previous year for direct marketing purposes.\nAlternatively, the law stipulates that if a business entity maintains a privacy policy that provide users with an \u201copt-out\u201d mechanism for use of personal information by third parties for their marketing purposes, the business entity may as an alternative provide you with information on how you may opt-out from the use of information by third parties for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>We have not shared your personal information with any third party for direct marketing purposes.\nShould you need this in writing, you can contact us via the information provided later in this Policy.&nbsp.\n<i>more_vert</i> Privacy Shield Privacy Shield Padlet complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework

perform application security testing.\npenetration testing.\nconduct risk assessments.\nand monitor compliance with security policies&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe&nbsp;</li>\n<li>When you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that&nbsp;</li>\n<li>information using secure socket layer technology

facility, with whom we have a contract providing for enhanced security measures.\nFor example, personal information is stored on a server equipped with industry standard firewalls.\nIn addition, the hosting facility provides a 24x7 security system, video surveillance, intrusion detection systems and locked cage areas&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We operate a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 security program to encourage an active community of third-party security researchers to report any security bugs to us&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We restrict access to personal information to authorized Padlet employees, agents or independent contractors who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations&nbsp;</li>\n<li>We require subprocessors to comply with security requirements via separate data processing agreements&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<br>Although we make concerted good

information in the user content itself).\nPadlets are shared documents and the creator of the padlet is ultimately the owner of the content on it.\nIt jeopardizes the contract between you and the padlet creator if you are allowed to delete content.\nIf you shared a Google Doc with someone and they edited it, you wouldn\u2019t want the edits to disappear if they deleted their account the

documents, files, links from the web, drawings, and maps.\n<br>\n<br>The administrators of a padlet (the creator and other users appointed as such by the creator) can choose its privacy \u2014 private, password protected, secret, public.\nThe privacy of your user content is dependent on the privacy of the padlet.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Private</em>: Only registered Padlet users invited to the padlet can view content.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Password protected</em>: People who have the password to the padlet can also view content.\n<br>\n<br>\n<em>Secret</em>: People who have the link to the padlet can view content.<br>\n<br>\n<em>Public</em>: Your content is public on the internet.&nbsp;<br>If you are contributing to a padlet, we advise you to exercise caution when sharing personal information regardless of the privacy level.\nThe administrators of a padlet can change its privacy at any time.\na padlet you thought was private today may become totally public tomorrow.\n<br>\n<br>Secret padlets have another catch.\nSince a link is just a combination of characters, it is theoretically possible for someone to access a secret padlet by guessing its link.\n<br>\n<br>Public padlets give us, Padlet, the right to view, share, and promote the content on them.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Precise Location Information&nbsp;</strong>We let users easily add maps to padlets.\nWhen adding a map, users can choose to add a map of their current location.\nShould a user choose to do so, we may request a one-time access to the user\u2019s precise location (correct to 10 meters).\nThe location is used only to generate the map that one time.\nWe do not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Payment
