privacy is important to us.\nWe understand that you are aware of and care about your privacy rights, and we take that seriously.\nThis Privacy Policy sets forth your privacy rights and applies to personal data we may collect: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Through our free, ad-supported website products, services and platforms;</li>\n<li>Through our free, ad-supported and subscription-based mobile applications (apps);</li>\n<li>Through emails and other electronic communications between you and us (with your consent, where required by law).\nand</li>\n<li>Through any software provided on or in connection with our website products, services and platforms, apps, and emails (collectively, the Services).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers Merriam-Webster products and services only.\nWhile you may encounter links on the Services to other websites and apps, such as those belonging to our third-party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners, please note that these third-party websites and apps are not covered by this Privacy Policy (unless otherwise noted on the linked website or app, which may be the case if, for example, the website or app is also owned and operated by Merriam-Webster).\nSee Links to Third-Party Websites or Apps below.</p>\n<p>Your decision to use the Services and provide your personal data is voluntary.\nWe indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested.\nYou may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our Cookie

Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you <p>As explained above, Merriam-Webster processes your data to provide you with the products and services you have requested or purchased from us, including special features, subscriptions, newsletters, and other content.\nSometimes we use third-party providers or work with co-sponsors to facilitate the delivery of the services or special features described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for the sole purpose of providing services to you on our behalf, such as Word of the Day or delivering the special feature.\nAlso, we may disclose your personal information in special legal circumstances.\nFor instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.</p>\n<p>To carry out these activities, Merriam-Webster may rely on many legal bases to process your personal data, including where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Service and to provide the requested Services to you;</li>\n<li>necessary

of others;</li>\n<li>you have expressly made information public.\nor</li>\n<li>you have consented to the processing, which may be revoked at any time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use your data for

privacy@m-w.com.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Payment card information <p>You may choose to purchase goods or services from Merriam-Webster using a payment card.\nTypically, payment card information is provided directly by users, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Merriam-Webster subscribes, and Merriam-Webster does not, itself, process or store your card information.\nWe strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email.\nWhen Merriam-Webster employees receive payment card information from users by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Links to Third-Party Websites or Apps <p>You may find advertising or other content on the Services that link to websites, apps,

of these features.\nMerriam-Webster provides these links solely as a convenience to you.\nMerriam-Webster does not control and is not responsible for the practices employed by websites, apps,

Demographics and Interest reporting, which is a Google Analytics Advertiser feature that collects and stores standard internet log and user information on our behalf and gathers information about what pages you visit, how long you are on our sites, how you got here, and what you click on during your visit.\nThis Google Analytics data is not tied to personal information, so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.\nFor our legitimate business interests, we use the data provided by Google Analytics Demographics and Interest reports to develop our services and content around our user demographics, interests, and behavior on our Services.\n</p>\n<p>We use Heap, Inc.\nto collect and analyze data about how you interact with our Services.\nHeap does this by collecting data on

used to infer whether you share interests with other users, and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.\nPlease visit DigiTrust Partners for more information.</p>\n<p>We also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this: <strong>e820bb4aba5ad74c5a6ff1aca16641f6</strong>) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers \u2013 doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.&nbsp.\nSpecifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc.\nand its group companies (\u2018LiveRamp\u2019).\nIX and LiveRamp may use our

such as your IP address, and other standard PC information.\nIf the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.\nThis type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently.\nSome internet browsers or other tools include \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.\nHowever, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Merriam-Webster does not currently respond to DNT signals.</p> Children's
