an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.\nYou agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.\nIn some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.\nIf you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.\nPlease review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.\nIf you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these

the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.\nThe price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.\nTaxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.\nWe may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.\nSuspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.\nConnecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.\nYou can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal

your billing account.</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Billing.</strong> By providing Microsoft with a payment method, you (i) represent that you are authorized to use the payment method you provided and that any payment information you provide is true and accurate.\n(ii) authorize Microsoft to charge you for the Services or available content using your payment method.\nand (iii) authorize Microsoft to

charged for recurring subscription Services.\nWe may bill you at the same time for more than one of your prior billing periods for amounts that haven't previously been processed.</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> When you purchase the Services on a subscription basis (e.g., monthly, every 3 months or annually), you agree that you are authorizing recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by Microsoft.\nYou must cancel your Services before the next billing date to stop being charged to continue your Services.\nWe will provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services.\nBy authorizing recurring payments, you are authorizing Microsoft to store your payment instrument and process such payments as either electronic debits or fund transfers, or as electronic drafts from your designated account (for Automated Clearing House or similar payments), or as charges to your designated account (for credit card or similar payments) (collectively, <strong>\"Electronic

(https://www.skype.com).\nThis is the only billing statement that we provide.\nIf we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within 90 days after the error first appears on your bill.\nWe will then promptly investigate the charge.\nIf you do not tell us within that time, you release us from all liability and claims of loss resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error or provide a refund.\nIf Microsoft has identified a billing error, we will correct that error within 90 days.</li>\n<li>f.\n<strong>Refund Policy.</strong> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable.\nIf you believe that Microsoft has charged you in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge.\nNo refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old.\nWe reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion.\nIf we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to issue the same or similar refund in the future.\nThis refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply.\nFor more refund information, please visit our help topic

Services ends at the end of your current Service period or, if we bill your account on a periodic basis, at the end of the period in which you canceled.\nIf you initiate a chargeback or reversal with your bank for your payment of Services, we will deem you to have canceled as of the date that the original payment was made, and you authorize us to immediately cancel your service and/or revoke any content that was provided to you in exchange for such payment.</li>\n<li>h.\n<strong>Trial-Period Offers.</strong> If you are taking part in any trial-period offer, you may be required to cancel the trial Service(s) within the timeframe communicated to you when you accepted the offer in order to avoid being charged to continue the Service(s) at the end of the trial period.</li>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Promotional Offers.</strong> From time to time, Microsoft may offer Services for a trial period during which Microsoft will not charge you for the Services.\nMicrosoft reserves the right to charge you for such Services (at the normal rate) if Microsoft determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are breaching the terms and conditions of the offer.</li>\n<li>j.\n<strong>Price Changes.</strong> We may change the price of the Services at any time and if you have a recurring purchase, we will notify you by email, or other reasonable manner, at least 15 days before the price change.\nIf you do not agree to the price change, you must cancel and stop using the Services before the price change takes effect.\nIf there is a fixed term and

on Skype\u2019s Help page (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=615383).</li>\n<li>m.\n<strong>Bank Account Payment Method.</strong> You may register an eligible bank account with your Microsoft account to use it as a payment method.\nEligible bank accounts include accounts held at a financial institution capable of receiving direct debit entries (e.g., a United States-based financial institution that supports automated clearing house (\"<strong>ACH</strong>\") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (\"<strong>SEPA</strong>\") or \"iDEAL\" in the Netherlands).\nTerms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the \u201cmandate\u201d in the case of SEPA) also apply.\nYou represent and

any part of section 15 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court

agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.\nIn some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.\nIf you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.\nPlease review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.\nIf you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.\nYou cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.\nTo protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.\nYou are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>ii.\n<strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active.\nThis means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.\nIf you don\u2019t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.\nYou must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.\nYou must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.\nIf we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.\nBased on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.\nIf you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website:

just in case you change your mind.\nAfter that 30- or 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft

happen.\nFirst, your right to use the Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nYou should have a

provider(s) to determine if there are any such fees that may apply to you.\n</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Service Notifications.</strong> When there\u2019s something we need to tell you about a Service you use, we\u2019ll send you Service notifications.\nIf you gave us your email address or phone number in connection with your Microsoft account, then we may send Service notifications to you via email or

associated with your Service or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party

charge.\nThe price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.\nThe price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.\nTaxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.\nWe may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.\nSuspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.\nConnecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.\nYou can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing into your account portal

recurring payments, and payments will be made to Microsoft by the method and at the recurring intervals you have agreed to, until the subscription for that Service is terminated by you or by

institution that supports automated clearing house (\"<strong>ACH</strong>\") entries, a European financial institution that supports Single Euro Payments Area (\"<strong>SEPA</strong>\") or \"iDEAL\" in the Netherlands).\nTerms you agreed to when adding your bank account as a payment method in your Microsoft account (e.g., the \u201cmandate\u201d in the case of SEPA) also apply.\nYou represent and warrant that your registered bank account is held in your name or you are authorized to register and use this bank account as a payment method.\nBy registering or selecting your bank account as your payment method, you authorize Microsoft (or its agent) to initiate one or more debits for the total amount of your purchase or subscription charge (in accordance with the terms of your subscription service) from your bank account (and, if necessary, initiate one or more credits to your bank account to correct errors, issue a refund or similar purpose), and you authorize the financial institution that holds your bank account to deduct such debits or accept such credits.\nYou understand that this authorization will remain in full force and effect until you remove your bank account information from your Microsoft account.\nContact customer support as outlined above in section 4.e as soon as possible if you believe you have been charged in error.\nLaws applicable in your country may also limit your liability for any fraudulent, erroneous or unauthorized transactions from your bank account.\nBy registering or selecting a bank account as your payment method, you acknowledge that you

hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally.\nIf we can\u2019t, you and we agree to <strong>binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury</strong>.\nInstead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.\n<strong>Class action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren\u2019t allowed.\nNor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.\n</strong>\"We,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" includes Microsoft, Skype (see section 10) and Microsoft\u2019s affiliates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a.\n<strong>Disputes Covered\u2014Everything Except IP.</strong> The term \"dispute\" is as broad as it can be.\nIt includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Services, the software related to the Services, the Services\u2019 or software\u2019s price, your Microsoft account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, <strong>except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors\u2019, our, or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights</strong>.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Mail a Notice of Dispute First.</strong> If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can\u2019t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S.\nMail to <strong>Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, U.S.A.</strong>.\nTell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want.\nA form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499.\nWe\u2019ll do the same if we have a dispute with you.\nAfter 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</li>\n<li>c.\n<strong>Small Claims Court Option.</strong> Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court if you meet the court\u2019s requirements in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, U.S.A..</li>\n<li>d.\n<strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong> The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).\nFor more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.\nTo start an arbitration, submit the form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245497 to the AAA and mail a copy to us.\nIn a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.\nAny in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or our principal place of business\u2014King County, Washington if your dispute is with Microsoft.\nYou choose.\nThe arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.\nUnder AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.\nBut a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.</li>\n<li>e.\n<strong>Arbitration Fees and Payments.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.</strong> We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nIf you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \u201caward\u201d), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.\n(ii) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\nand (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.</li>\n<li>ii.\n<strong>Disputes Involving More than $75,000.</strong> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>f.\n<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules.</strong> These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>\n<li>g.\n<strong>Must File Within One Year.</strong> You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes\u2014see section 15.a) within one year from when it first could be filed.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s permanently barred.</li>\n<li>h.\n<strong>Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.</strong> You may reject any change we make to section 15 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.\nMail to the address in section 15.b.\nIf you do, the most recent version of section 15 before the change you rejected will apply.</li>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of section 15 (Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect (with an arbitration award issued before any court proceeding begins), except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class-wide or representative arbitration, section 15 will be unenforceable in its entirety.</li>\n</ul>Full textMiscellaneousMiscellaneous16_17_18_miscellaneousSummary<p>16.\n<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong> This section, and sections 1, 9 (for amounts incurred before the end of

personal data<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nIn particular, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.\nIt also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>\n<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>\n<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>\n<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>\n<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.\nFor example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.\nTo build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.\nFor example, we manually review short snippets of voice data that we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech recognition technologies.\nThis manual review may be conducted by Microsoft employees or vendors who are working on Microsoft\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p>Microsoft uses the data we

these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).\nFor example, Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.\nHowever, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.\nFor example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes

do so with your consent and/or as required to provide the products you use, operate our business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data section of this privacy statement.\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide our products</strong>.\nWe use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nFor example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service.\nOr, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.\nAdditionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.\nFor example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.\nWe also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product improvement</strong>.\nWe use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.\nFor example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to develop and improve speech recognition accuracy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization</strong>.\nMany products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment.\nThese features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location.\nFor example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nIf you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices.\nMany of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product activation</strong>.\nWe use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product development</strong>.\nWe use data to develop new

authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>.\nWe use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.\nThis includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products.\nThis may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safety</strong>.\nWe use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers.\nOur security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.\nFor example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links.\nand we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Updates</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.\nFor example, we may use information about your device\u2019s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch.\nUpdates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and evaluate whether your device is ready to process such updates.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Promotional communications</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to deliver promotional communications.\nYou can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from

predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>.\nMicrosoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.\nWe use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.\nWe may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.\nFor more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>.\nWe use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores.\nFor example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.\nOr, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transacting commerce</strong>.\nWe use data to carry out your transactions with us.\nFor example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reporting and business operations</strong>.\nWe use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence.\nThis enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protecting rights and property</strong>.\nWe use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property.\nFor example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy.\nWe may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal compliance</strong>.\nWe process data to comply with law.\nFor example, we use the age of our customers to assist us in meeting our obligations to protect children\u2019s privacy.\nWe also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Research.</strong>

can use to find and play games, movies, music, and other digital entertainment.\nWhen they sign in to Xbox, in apps, games or on a console, we assign a unique identifier to their device.\nFor instance, when their Xbox console is connected to the internet and they sign in to the console, we identify which console and which version of the console\u2019s operating system they are using.</p>\n<p>Xbox continues to provide new experiences in client apps that are connected to and backed by services such as Xbox network and cloud gaming.\nWhen signed in to an Xbox experience, we

as text.\nIf a player activates this feature, Microsoft uses the resulting text data to provide captioning of chat for players who need it.\nThis data may also be used to provide a safe gaming environment and enforce the\u202fCommunity Standards for Xbox.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data use</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses the data we collect to improve gaming products and experiences\u2014 making it safer and more fun over time.\nData we collect also enables us to provide your child with personalized, curated experiences.\nThis includes connecting them to games, content, services, and recommendations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox data viewable by others</strong>.\nWhen your child is using the Xbox network, their online presence\u202f(which can be set to \u201cappear offline\u201d or

they\u202fmight share information when playing or communicating with others on the Xbox network.</p>\n<p>In order to help make the Xbox network a safe gaming environment and enforce the Community Standards for Xbox, we may collect and review voice, text, images, videos and in-game content (such as game clips your child uploads, conversations they have, and things they post in clubs and games).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Xbox data shared with game and apps publishers</strong>.\nWhen your child uses an Xbox online game or any network-connected app on their Xbox console, PC, or mobile device, the publisher of that game or app has access to data about their usage to help the publisher deliver, support, and improve its product.\nThis data may include: your child\u2019s Xbox user identifier, gamertag, limited account info such as country and age range, data about your child\u2019s in-game communications, any Xbox enforcement activity, game-play sessions (for example, moves made in-game or types of vehicles used in-game), your child\u2019s presence on the Xbox network, the time they spend playing the game or app, rankings, statistics, gamer profiles, avatars, or gamerpics, friends lists, activity feeds for official clubs they belong to, official club memberships, and any content they create or submit in the game or app.</p>\n<p>Third-party publishers and developers of games and apps have their own distinct and independent relationship with users and their collection and usage of personal data is subject to their specific privacy policies.\nYou should carefully review their policies to determine how they use your child\u2019s data.\nFor example, publishers may choose to disclose or display game data (such as on leaderboards) through their own services.\nYou may find their policies linked from the game or app detail pages in our stores.</p>\n<p>Learn more at\u202fData Sharing with Games and Apps.</p>\n<p>To stop sharing game or app data with a publisher, remove its games or app from all devices where they have been installed.\nSome publisher access to your child\u2019s data may be revoked at\u202fmicrosoft.com/consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing child

technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nFor example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.\nWhen we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.\nMicrosoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Where we store and process personal dataWhere we store and process personal data<p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates,

Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nTypically, the primary storage location is in the customer\u2019s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region.\nThe storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.\nWe take steps to process the data that we collect under this privacy statement according to this statement\u2019s provisions and the requirements of applicable law.</p>\n<p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.\nFor example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.\nWhen we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts such as the standard contractual clauses published by the European Commission under Commission Implementing Decision 2021/914, to help protect your rights and enable these protections to travel with your data.\nTo learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.\nMicrosoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nThe controlled U.S.\nsubsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles\u2014for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S.\nentities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>If there is any conflict between

established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.\nPlease contact us if you\u2019d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts.\nAs further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding

transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.\nIn such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).\n(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.\nConversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>\n</ul>Top of page<i>\n</i>California Consumer Privacy ActCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act<p>If you are

Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and Cortana, and third-party connected products.\nIf you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services.\nYou can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.\nSee Account Privacy Settings for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Office Roaming Service</strong>.\nThe Office Roaming Service helps keep your Microsoft 365 settings up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365.\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document).\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device.\nThe Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings when you sign in to Office.com.\nWhen you sign out of Microsoft 365, the Office Roaming Service removes your Microsoft 365 settings from your device.\nAny changes you make to your customized Microsoft 365 settings are sent to Microsoft servers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Updates</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses services such as Click-to-Run or Microsoft AutoUpdate to provide you with security and other

selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.\nThese privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences.\nFor example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content.\nTurning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage.\nBut even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>\n<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.\nFor example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.\nRequired service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.\nSee Essential Services for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.\nAs you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.\nThis data is necessary because this information enables

connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nIf you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.\nYour text and the translation are not stored by our service.\nRequired service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>\n<p> See Required service

permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.\nThis de-identified location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/) and Skyhook (see https://www.skyhook.com) to improve the location services of the provider.</p>\n<p>Windows services and features, apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.\nSome features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location.\nFor information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>\n<p> When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission.\nWe will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).\nData about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.\nYou can clear your device's location history at any time in the Windows settings app.\n</p>\n<p>In the Windows settings app, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location.\nYou can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>\n<p> Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.\n</p>\n<p> In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.\nIf your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location.\nLearn more about location in Windows.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General Location</strong>.\nIf you turn on Location services, apps that cannot use your precise location may still have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find my device</strong>.\nThe Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.\nTo enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.\nThis feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.\nWhen the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recording</strong>.\nSome Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others.\nIf you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device.\nIn some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly.\n<strong>Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication.\nThis may include obtaining the prior consent of everyone participating in the conversation or any other authorizations as required.</strong> Microsoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Security and safety featuresSecurity and safety features<p>\n<strong>Device encryption</strong>.\nDevice encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology.\nWhen device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key.\nThe BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account.\nMicrosoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>.\nThe Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update.\nMSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found.\nWhen the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device.\nDuring a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device.\nIf you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Family</strong>.\nParents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device.\nThere are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family.\nIf you live in a region that requires permission to create an account to access Microsoft services, you may be prompted to request or give parental consent.\nIf a user is under the statutory age in your region, during the registration process they will be prompted to request consent from a parent or guardian by entering an adult\u2019s email.\nWhen Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities.\nActivity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device.\nWhen checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file.\nWhen checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device.\nIf Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device.\nWhen Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection.\nIf a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent.\nYou can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and TypingSpeech, Voice Activation, Inking, and Typing<p>\n<strong>Speech</strong>.\nMicrosoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and cloud-based (online) speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on the Online speech recognition setting lets apps use Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition.\nAdditionally, in Windows 10, the Online speech recognition setting enables your ability to use dictation within Windows.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.\nBoth device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.\nWith both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> When you use cloud-based speech recognition technologies from Microsoft, whether enabled by the Online speech recognition setting or when you interact with HoloLens or voice typing, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to provide the speech recognition service by creating a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data.\nMicrosoft will not listen to your voice recording without your permission.\nTo learn more about how Microsoft manages your voice data, see Speech recognition technologies.\n</p>\n<p> You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft.\nHowever, Microsoft cloud-based speech recognition technologies provide more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition.\nWhen the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don\u2019t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition\u2014like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app\u2014will still work and Microsoft won\u2019t collect any voice data.\n</p>\n<p> You can turn off online speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop any apps that rely on the Online speech recognition setting from sending your voice data to Microsoft.\nIf you are using a HoloLens or Windows Mixed Reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop the device from listening for your voice input.\nLearn more about speech recognition in Windows.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Voice Activation</strong>.\nWindows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app\u2014for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond when you say \u201cCortana.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords.\nOnce a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer.\nThe app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands.\nEach app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.</p>\n<p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked.\nIf enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device.\nWhen the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p>\n<p> You can turn off voice activation at any time.\nLearn more about voice activation in Windows.\n</p>\n<p> Even when you\u2019ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Voice typing</strong>.\nIn Windows 11, dictation has been updated and renamed as voice typing.\nLike dictation, voice typing uses online speech recognition technologies to power its speech-to-text transcription service.\nYou can also choose to contribute voice clips to help improve voice typing.\nIf you choose not to contribute voice clips, you can still use voice typing.\nYou can change your choice anytime in the voice typing settings.\nMicrosoft will not listen to your voice recordings without your permission.\nLearn more about voice typing in Windows.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inking &amp.\nTyping Personalization</strong>.\nYour typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you with: a personal dictionary, better character recognition to help you type and write on your device, and text suggestions that appear as you type or write.\n</p>\n<p> You can turn off Inking &amp.\ntyping personalization at any time.\nThis will delete data stored on your device, such as your personal dictionary.\nLearn more about inking &amp.\ntyping personalization in Windows.\n</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Sync and backup settingsSync and backup settings<p>When you sign into Windows with your
