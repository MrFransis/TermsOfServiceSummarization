an unrestricted, fully paid-up, royalty-free, worldwide, irrevocable, sublicensable, and perpetual license to use any and all information, content, and other materials (collectively, \u201cContributed Content\u201d) that you submit or otherwise provide to this site (including, without limitation, genealogical data, images, writings, documents, materials, recordings, discussions, information, and data relating to deceased persons or anything else) for any and all purposes, in any and all manners, and in any and all forms of media that we, in our sole discretion, deem appropriate for the furtherance of our mission to promote family history and genealogical research.\nAs part of this license, you give us permission to copy, publicly display, transmit, broadcast, perform, distribute, and otherwise use (and allow others to use) your Contributed Content throughout the world, by any means we deem appropriate (electronic or otherwise, including on the Internet).\nYou also understand and agree that as part of this license, we have the right to create (and to allow others to create) and use derivative works from your Contributed Content by combining all or a portion of it with that of other contributors or by otherwise modifying your Contributed Content.</p> Collaboration with Others <p>You acknowledge that a primary purpose of this site is to enable collaboration between users of this site and other sites who wish to expand their genealogical databases and knowledge.\nYou acknowledge that we may utilize Contributed Content, including any personal information of living individuals, that you submit for the purpose of collaborating and sharing with other individuals and organizations (including commercial genealogical organizations) in order, for example, to create a global common pedigree for the purposes of increasing participation in family history and preserving records throughout the world.\nYou acknowledge that collaboration between multiple individuals and organizations allows us to obtain additional data that we may provide to users of this site\u2014thus allowing users to extend their own ancestral lines.\nOur\u202f Privacy Notice\u202f provides more details regarding our use of your Contributed Content.\n</p>\n<p>You agree to input data accurately to the best of your knowledge.\nTo maintain consistencies in traditional genealogical views

comments.\nPlease refer to the Code of Conduct section for an outline of possible consequences for the improper entry of data.</p>\n<p>This site includes a discussion feature in which individuals can comment and otherwise provide Contributed Content regarding a particular deceased individual and provide details regarding that individual.\nWe reserve the right to reuse the discussion information and other Contributed Content provided and to publish it to others in an effort to help resolve open issues posed or to help educate others.\nWe ask you to be selective in the information you include in your online discussions and other Contributed Content, communicating instead through e-mail or other means where personal contact information or other personal or sensitive information is being provided.\nYou acknowledge that any items you submit through the discussion feature will be viewable by anyone able to access this site.\nThe discussion feature is intended to help collaboration efforts, to coordinate the correction of errors, and to facilitate additional research with other interested users.\nThe discussion feature may not (a) be used for reasons irrelevant to the deceased individual being discussed, (b) include information that might harm or embarrass any living person, or (c) include offensive, indecent, inappropriate, threatening, or abusive language or content.\nDisagreements regarding facts pertaining to a deceased individual are likely to occur, and such disagreements should be set out in clear terms based on the facts and citing sources where possible, without resorting to abrupt, insulting, or unkind language or comments.\nThe discussion feature may not be used to provide links to external websites with inappropriate content (although links to related and tasteful information regarding deceased individuals may be appropriate) or in order to solicit business or offer research services.\nAlthough we have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to delete or edit Contributed Content provided in the discussion feature and similar features and to deny users access to such features for any or no reason.\nPlease refer to the Code of Conduct section for an outline of the possible consequences for the improper use of the discussion feature and similar features.&nbsp;</p> Software <p>If you

genealogical submission, through a discussion feature, or through any other feature where any Contributed Content can be provided) that could be deemed harmful or offensive to other users, nor will you impersonate another user in order to hide your identity or implicate another in such actions.\nYou agree not to mine, collect, or use any information from this site with the intent to harm, discredit, harass, or prejudice any person or entity.\nYou further agree to do nothing that might disrupt the flow of data to and from this site, impact the service or performance of this site, or

Privacy Notice (Updated 2021-04-06) <p>In this Notice, we, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and its entities, provide you with information about how we process your personal data.\nWhen referring to \"us\" or \"we\" or \"our\" we mean the Church and Church entities.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWho controls your personal data?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acts through its representatives and Church entities when we process your personal data.\nWhen you share personal data with us, you are sharing it with the Church through Church entities.</p>\n<p>a.\nThe Church: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the \" <strong>Church</strong>\") is a community of people who believe the same religious doctrine, practice the same religious rites and ordinances, and are governed by ecclesiastical principles.\nLocal units of the Church, such as wards, branches, stakes, districts, missions, and areas, are merely subdivisions of this community of believers and are not separate legal entities.\nlimited exceptions apply.\n</p>\n<p>b.\nChurch entities: To satisfy temporal affairs needs and fulfill other purposes of the Church, a legal structure composed of various distinct legal entities assists the Church throughout the world.\nThese distinct legal entities (herein \" <strong>Church entities</strong>\") are legally separate from the Church.\nOne of those Church entities, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a Utah corporation sole, together with one or more other Church entities, processes your personal data as responsible joint data controllers.\nSome Church entities may receive personal data as data processors to provide services to those Church entities that act as data controllers.\nAt your request, we will provide you with information as to which Church entities process your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp.\nWhat personal data do we collect?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect personal data that (a) you actively submit to us, (b) we record, and (c) we obtain from third parties.\nWe may process your personal data with or without automatic means, including collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, analysis, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of your personal data.</p>\n<p>a.&nbsp.\nActively submitted data.\nYou submit personal data to us when you join the Church, seek Church ordinances, request Church materials, request access to Church tools or services, or engage in other interactions or communications with the Church.\nWhen you interact with the Church, we generally process name, birth date, birthplace, telephone number, email address, physical address, photo, gender, donation/payment information, and so on.\nYou may provide us with additional information to participate at your own initiative in surveys, contests, or other activities or events, including when you participate in video or audio recordings, such as when using video conferencing technology.\nParticipation in surveys, contests, and similar activities is optional.\nIf you do not wish to participate in, or provide personal data in connection with, such activities, this will not affect your membership status or ability to use available Church tools or services.\nIn each such case you will know what personal data you provide to us because you actively and voluntarily submit the data.</p>\n<p>b.\nData we obtain from third parties and passively submitted data.\nWhen local law permits, you may submit personal data, including contact information about someone other than yourself (in other words, a third party) to allow us to make contact with that person, make a delivery, or otherwise meet your request.\nWhen providing personal data about anyone other than yourself, you must first obtain the other person\u2019s informed consent if his or her consent is legally required.</p>\n<p>If you or someone else has provided us with your personal contact information and you would like to request that we do not contact you further, please follow the unsubscribe or opt-out procedures provided on the specific site, newsletter or email notification, or please contact us at DataPrivacyOfficer@ChurchofJesusChrist.org.\n</p>\n<p>We may process and make publicly available personal data obtained from published sources.\nWe may process and publish living information in compliance with applicable local laws.</p>\n<p>Your location-based information may be collected by some mobile applications for the purpose of helping you find the nearest temple or meetinghouse location or for a similar reason.\nYou can edit the settings on your device to opt out of location-based services.</p>\n<p>When you visit any of our resources, our servers (using log files or
