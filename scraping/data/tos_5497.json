your browser, device, and your IP address.</p>\n<p>Cookies are a key part of how we deliver advertising on our sites.\nAmong other uses, they allow us to show more relevant advertising to people who visit ferates.com by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our site.\nWe can then show you adverts which we believe may interest you.</p>\n<p>The advertising techniques we use <strong>do not collect information such as your name, email</strong>\n<strong>address, postal address, or phone number.\n</strong>We sometimes use information such as your IP<strong>\n</strong>address and browser type and sometimes share some limited aspects of this with third parties for advertising purposes.</p>\n<p>We may also share online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners.\nThis means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.</p>\n<p>Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with other sites.\nThe use of cookies may mean that when you are on another site, you may be shown advertising based on what you have looked at on ferates.com.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products, you were browsing.\nThis allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>HOW TO MANAGE ADVERTISING
