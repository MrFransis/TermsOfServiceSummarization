using Plex! We here at Plex care deeply about your privacy, and we strive to ensure that your personal information always stays safe while we work hard to provide you a service you love and trust.\nOur Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and transfer your information, and how you can control the use of the information that we collect.\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all our products and services, including Plex client apps, streaming content to the Plex client apps, our premium Plex Pass service, Plex Media Server software, and all other Plex software and services (collectively, our \u201cServices\u201d).\nYour personal content is stored on your personal hardware (\u201cPersonal Content\u201d).\nExcept in the limited circumstances described below, we do not collect filenames or content titles of your Personal Content.\nWe do, however, keep usage statistics to allow us to better serve you and improve our Services.\nWe may use information about how you use our Services to run and improve our Services, to provide, customize, and personalize communications and other content that we deliver or offer to you.\nThis is discussed in detail below.</p>\n<p>Download a PDF version here.</p>\nContacting Us\n<p>You can contact Plex via our contact page.\nYou can also browse our FAQ and support articles.</p>\nInformation We Collect\n<p>You may choose to provide us with certain information, such as when you create your user profile or when you use the Services.\nWe may also collect automatically-generated and technical information.\nTherefore, the information we have (\u201cCollected Information\u201d) may include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Profile Information</b>.\nYou may provide us with profile information such as your e-mail address, username, a profile image, and password when you create an account, or when you edit your account information.\nYou may also provide us with your payment information when you sign-up for a paid service.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information from External Services</b>.\nIf you choose to connect your account to an account of an external service, such as a social networking site, we may collect certain information from those accounts, such as your name and email address as well as data required to connect to that service.\nYou may provide such authorization during the connection process, or it may be implicit in the service authorization itself.\nFor example, if you choose to connect your Plex account to a social networking account, we may collect your public profile information if you agree to the collection of this information during the connection process.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Metadata for Personal Content</b>.\nExcept for certain exceptions such as Third-Party Control and Playback Mechanisms and image analysis (i.e., metadata about photos when these features are user-enabled, such as geotag information or scene recognition analysis), as described below, we do not collect or store metadata (information about the specific file, cover art, subtitles, running length, etc.) for Personal Content stored on your personal Plex Media Server.\nHowever, your Plex Media Server may anonymously send us filenames or other identifiers for your Personal Content for the sole purpose of providing metadata back to your personal Plex Media Server.\nYou may disable this metadata matching capability.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Metadata for Personal Content for Integration with Third-Party Control and Playback Mechanisms</b>.\nWe may offer integrations with Third-Party Control and Playback Mechanisms that you may choose to use, such as Sonos, Amazon Alexa, IFTTT, Zapier, SmartThings, webhooks, etc.\nIn order to provide the integrations with the Third-Party Control and Playback Mechanisms, we may collect Metadata for your Personal Content that is needed to integrate with the Third-Party Control and Playback Mechanisms.\nFor example, if you use Amazon Alexa to play a particular song or movie from among your Personal Content at your home, then our Services may search your Personal Content in order to find and play the song or movie that you requested.\nInformation provided by you to the Third-Party Control or Playback Mechanisms is not governed by this privacy policy.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Usage Statistics for Personal Content</b>.\nWe may collect usage statistics for Personal Content.\nThis includes information about your interaction with the Services, such as device information, duration, bit rate, media formats, resolution, and media type (music, photos, videos, etc.).\nWhere possible, we will generalize this information to avoid identifying your Personal Content.\nUsage statistics do not include specific content titles or filenames.\nWe may use information related to your usage to run and improve our Services, to provide, customize, and personalize communications and other content that we deliver or offer to you.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Data Related to Third-Party Content</b>.\nWhen you use the Services to watch, listen to, or record content from a third-party content provider or source such as any officially supported Third-Party Content that Plex streams to Plex apps, trailers and extras from Internet Video Archive (IVA), or use of our Live TV and DVR service, we may collect information related to that media interaction.\nFor example, we may collect what program or movie you are watching and when, your interaction with any static or video advertising, etc.\nWe may also collect your device information and device location, for example, by using your IP address or by asking for your zip code.\nWe may use this information to run and improve our Services, provide advertising and marketing to you, as well as share anonymous or aggregated versions of the data with third parties.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information about integrated Third-Party Services</b>.\nWe may collect information about your use of third-party services for reporting to these partners and calculating the fees that we owe them.\nFor example, we report the number of trailers and extras viewed to IVA.\nWe may also collect information about third party services and your use of

advertising.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information on our Services</b>.\nWe may store information about your configuration or use of our Services when you create a Plex Media Server on a local device, connect to a Plex Media Server that you or another person has configured, or download or connect to a Plex app, or interact with or use other Plex software or Service.\nThis information may include an IP address and port number(s), the name of a Plex Media Server, and information used to secure access to our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Information about Interfacing Software</b>.\n\u201cInterfacing Software\u201d includes but is not limited to, plug-ins for the Services, channel plug-ins, metadata agents, and client applications that communicate directly or indirectly with the Services.\nWe may store copies of Interfacing Software that you provide to Plex and that accesses or calls any software provided by Plex as part of the Services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Debugging and Other Information Voluntarily Provided</b>.\nYou may send us logs, metadata, or other information about your devices, media, and experiences for the purpose of resolving an issue you may have with the software or suggesting desired features.\nOn client applications where it is possible, we will offer the ability to opt-out of sending crash reports.\nIf you would like to learn more about the information being sent in crash reports, we encourage you to review the privacy policies for the third-party client applications you are using to access Plex Services.\nThe information being sent to us will only be used to help resolve your issue and / or improve our Services, and using our Services and provision of such information, you agree to such use by us.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Device Information</b>.\nLike many online services, we may collect information about the devices that are used to access our Services, such as the IP address of the device, the operating system and version of the device, the browser that you use to access a Plex web page, and the versions of the Plex technologies being used.\nWe may also collect location information about the devices that access our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Application Information</b>.\nWhen a request for information or content is sent to a Plex Media Server, we may collect an application identifier that identifies which application sent the request.\nAn application identifier uniquely identifies a particular copy of an application.\nFor example, if you download an application from Plex, fully uninstall the copy of the application, and then re-download the application from Plex, the new copy of the application will be associated with a different application identifier than the uninstalled copy of the application.\nNote that simply deleting the app without fully uninstalling may not reset the application identifier.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Plex Relay Service</b>.\nWe may provide, and you may choose to use, the Plex Relay Service to connect or stream your Personal Content to another device.\nIf you choose to use the Plex Relay Service, we will transfer the data necessary to perform the service.\nAll such traffic is encrypted from end-to-end in a manner that makes it impossible for Plex or the Plex Relay Service to decrypt or view any data.\nThe data transferred via the Plex Relay Service is not stored by Plex except for the temporary buffering of data required to provide you with an optimal streaming experience.\nYou can disable the Plex Relay Service by turning off Remote Access in your server settings.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technology</b>.\nLike many online services, Plex uses cookies, tracking pixels, and similar technologies to collect information that helps us provide our Services to you.\nWe also use these technologies to help market our products and services to you and other customers.\nFor more information about these technologies and how you may control them, please see the detailed description of Tracking Technologies.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Obtaining Consent</b>.\nIf there is a change to any product or feature that we offer or have offered, and in order to use that product or feature a material change to the collection and / or use of information (including for Personal Content) not contemplated by the Privacy Policy is needed, we will obtain your consent before such collection and / or use.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Your Collected Information</b>.\nIn order to view, amend, erase, or correct your Collected Information, contact Plex support.\nAll requests will be answered within one month of

be able to provide you the fullest version of our services.</li>\n<li>We use the Collected Information to provide you with the Services, improve the Services, enhance your user experience, and communicate with you.\nFor example, for Third-Party Content, we use information about your interactions with the Services to track the watch state of media items that have been linked to the Services on devices that have been linked to the Services.\nWe use this information to allow you to resume watching in the same watch state on different Plex-linked devices.</li>\n<li>We use your profile information to contact you about your account or about new Plex functionality and certain Plex news and information.\nYou may opt-out of certain types of communications by editing your account settings.</li>\n<li>If you choose to connect your Plex account to a third-party account or service to have us and /or that third party provide a particular feature or service, we will provide that external service with the information needed to have us and / or that third party perform the requested feature or service.\nFor example, if you connect your account to a social networking site and give us permission to publish posts on your behalf, we will do so.\nAdditionally, unless you request or allow us to publish other information, the content of the published posts will be limited to describing your interactions with the Services.\nAs another example, if you choose to have us send (or \u201cscrobble\u201d) your listening history to Last.fm, obtain metadata from a third party service, or use a third-party recommendation service, we use Collected Information to engage with and / or send the Collected Information to that service when you request that service.\nThe shared information may include metadata about the media (such as title, duration, author, cover art, dates associated with the media, and other relevant information) and information about the media itself (such as resolution, bit rate, format, location, etc.).</li>\n<li>We use Collected Information related to Personal Content when you provide consent or otherwise request us to do so, as well as when necessary to provide the services you requested.</li>\n<li>We use Collected Information related to Third-Party Content to allow us and our partners to personalize marketing, advertising, and other

viewing trends.</li>\n<li>With third parties to improve and deliver advertising to you on our behalf.</li>\n<li>If you request or consent to our sharing of Collected Information with a third party.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>We may apply automated decision-making to Collected Information to recommend content to you that we think you may be interested in.</li>\n<li>We will not share with

is commonly known as \u201ccookies.\u201d A cookie is a small text file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us or our business partners to manage and report on your interaction with the Services.\nThrough cookies, we are able to collect non-personally identifiable information that we use to improve the Service, keep count of return visits to our website or partners\u2019 websites, collect and report on aggregate statistical information, or authenticate your login credentials.\nWe may also collect other data such as the page or site that referred you to the Services, the date and time you visited the Services, and your current IP address.</p>\n<p>We also use analytics technologies, such as Google Analytics.\nTo learn more about Google Analytics and your privacy, visit http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.\nTo opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics when using our site, visit http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>\n<p>By providing us with information about how you interact with our website, apps and products, these tools help us learn how to make the Plex experience even better and customize our communications with you.\nFor example, these technologies can tell us things like how you arrived at the Plex site, if you have visited the site before, how long you stay on the site, and which pages you visit.\nThey also provide us with general information about where in the world you may be located.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may contract with third-party marketing partners and advertising networks that use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your visits to and actions on certain pages of our site and about whether you open certain emails we send you.\nWe do this in order to serve advertisements for relevant Plex products and services to you later, such as when you are on certain third-party sites, and to measure the performance of our messages.\nWe do not share any of your account information or account content with a third party as part of this process.\nYou may opt out of these targeting and advertising cookies at any time by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page, where you can select to opt out of some or all third-party advertising networks.</p>\n<p>The Services use social media features provided by companies and services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ to enable you to share information with these channels.\nCookies used by these services are owned and controlled by third parties, and therefore the third parties, and not Plex, are responsible for their use.\nAs such, we can\u2019t guarantee that we have listed every cookie you might get from a third party since a third party could change these cookies at any time as their needs change.\nFor your convenience, below are links to some of the most commonly used social networks and their privacy policies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook:

many online services, Plex and its third party partners (such as Facebook, Google and Amazon) employ a technology known as \u201ctracking pixels.\u201d A pixel is a small one-pixel-by-one-pixel clear image that is embedded in HTML content, and is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence.\nWhen HTML content containing a pixel is rendered, the pixel transmits anonymous, non-personally identifiable information to a server, such as a numeric count, unique identifier, or IP address.\nPlex and its partners use pixels to help us better manage our Services.\nFor example, we may place a pixel in HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened, or on a webpage to count the number of unique visitors to that page.\nThe use of a pixel allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and of our marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to receive tracking pixels, you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, but that may affect your ability to view images in other email that you receive.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>http://google.com/settings/ads</li>\n<li>http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</li>\n</ul>\nEmail\n<p>We do not sell or give your email address to other companies for their own marketing purposes without your permission.\nHowever, we may use your email address or other registration data to provide you with technical support, send you communications about the Service or other promotional offers you have elected to receive, and to serve you with marketing offers that are more relevant to your interests.\nWe may occasionally work with data partners to help increase the relevancy of marketing offers we provide to our customers.\nIn doing so, we may provide such companies with information representing an encrypted or hashed value derived from information you have provided to us, such as your email address.</p> ", "created_at": "2019-05-18 19:57:19.29948", "updated_at": "2019-05-18 19:58:33.118117"}, {"id": 2735, "name": "Terms of Service",
