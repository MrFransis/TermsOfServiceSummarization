include a feature (\u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d on iOS or \u201cOpt Out of Interest-Based Ads\u201d or \u201cOpt Out of Ads Personalization\u201d on Android) that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through mobile apps used for interest-based advertising purposes.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Legal Basis for Processing<br>\n</p>\n<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data.\nWhere those laws apply, our legal grounds are:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Legitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of SmugMug (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:<br>- Facilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;<br>- Providing customer service;<br>- Some of our marketing and advertising activities;<br>- Analyzing and improving business activities;<br>- Protecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services).\nand<br>- Managing risks and legal issues.</li>\n<li>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them.\n&nbsp;For example, when we process an individual\u2019s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Consent:<br>- If the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent.\nFor example, we conduct some of our direct marketing on the basis of consent.<br>- If the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.<br>- Legal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.<br>- Legal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We process a user\u2019s Photographer Personal Data as the user\u2019s \u201cprocessor\u201d (under the GDPR and similar laws) or \u201cservice provider\u201d (under the California Consumer Privacy Act) as set forth in our agreement with the user.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Security<br>\n</p>\n<p>SmugMug takes physical, technical and administrative measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nHowever, no security measure is perfect.\nSmugMug cannot and does not promise that any information will remain secure.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Data Retention<br>\n</p>\n<p>We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless the law requires us to keep it for a longer period of time.\nInformation in copies made for backup and business continuity may remain for longer than the original data.\nFor example, photos and videos that are marked for deletion, or that are in an account that gets closed, are de-published almost immediately and are permanently removed from backup copies 30 days later.\nCertain information relating to payments to photographers must be retained for at least six years for U.S.\ntax compliance reasons.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Data Transfers<br>\n</p>\n<p>To provide the Services, we may transfer your information to servers operated by SmugMug or our service providers in the United States or other countries.\nWhen we transfer information from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) or UK to countries that the European Commission has not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection, we normally do so on the basis of either (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission for such purpose or (ii) the recipient\u2019s participation in the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (described below).\nYou may request a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses by contacting us as described below.<br>\n</p>\n<p>SmugMug, Inc.\ncomplies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data we receive in the U.S.\nfrom the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.\nThis commitment extends to the personal information received in the U.S.\nfrom the UK, regardless of the status of Brexit.\nSmugMug has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.<br>\n</p>\n<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data.\nCovered individuals in Europe with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.\nWe have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your Privacy Shield complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe Privacy Shield services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.\nUnlike some other rights described in

binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.\nSmugMug, Inc.\nis subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.<br>\n</p>\n<p>If we share personal data transferred to the U.S.\nunder the Privacy Shield with an agent that processes such data on our behalf, then we will have certain responsibility under the Privacy Shield Principles if both (i) the agent Processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Our Services allow our users to transfer Photographer Personal Data (such as by publishing it), and our users (not SmugMug) are responsible for their transfers.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Your Choices<br>\n</p>\n<p>Privacy Requests Regarding Users\u2019 Photos, Videos, and Some Related Data<br>\n</p>\n<p>For privacy-related takedown requests, or to exercise any rights you may have under privacy law regarding images or videos

(Photographer Personal Data), <strong>please contact that user directly</strong>.\nSmugMug processes this data on behalf of the user, and <strong>the user has responsibility for handling these requests</strong>.\nUnder the GDPR and similar laws, SmugMug is the user\u2019s \u201cprocessor\u201d of this limited set of data, and under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), SmugMug is the user\u2019s \u201cservice provider\u201d for this data.\n(SmugMug still can remove illegal content and other material that users are not entitled to maintain on the Service, such as nonconsensual intimate images, which can be reported at https://help.smugmug.com/contact.)<br>\n</p>\n<p>SmugMug users can follow the instructions below to handle such requests or to otherwise manage their

Information<br>\n</p>\n<p>By default, SmugMug will display a link showing EXIF data about photos or video you upload.\nThe link shows on all your individual photo pages, and displays the make

you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information by our application\u2019s camera function at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Some cameras and applications can store GPS (location) coordinates in a photo's EXIF header.\nSmugMug imports that data and if you choose, SmugMug can display that data publicly.\nThis display setting can be changed in gallery settings \"Permissions and Sharing\" on smugmug.com.\nYou can also change the settings on your camera to stop location data storage.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Auto-Upload Feature<br>\n</p>\n<p>If you turn on the auto-upload feature, photos and videos from your mobile device camera roll will be automatically uploaded to SmugMug.\nThese

Notifications<br>\n</p>\n<p>Visit your SmugMug Account Settings area to edit your SmugMug email notification settings.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Other Data Protection Rights<br>\n</p>\n<p>The law of your jurisdiction may give you additional rights to make certain requests with respect to your personal data.\nThis is the case, for example, for residents of the European Economic Area and Switzerland, and, as described further below, residents of California.\nOur preference is to treat requests from all users in a similar way, regardless of where they live, to the extent we find this practicable and legally feasible.\nSo although we describe the rights that exist under certain specific laws and frameworks below, we are happy to receive such requests from users in different jurisdictions as well.<br>\n</p>\n<p>As a reminder, regardless of where you live, all requests to exercise privacy rights with respect to Photographer Personal Data should be addressed to the user who uploaded that content, not SmugMug.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Under the Privacy Shield and laws like the GDPR, some individuals have a legal request access to, correction of, or deletion of certain personal data we store.\nIn some cases, they are be entitled to receive a copy of the personal data they provided to us in portable form or to request that we share it with a third party.\nThe law also gives them the right to request certain restrictions on the use of their personal data, to object to our use of their personal data, or, where applicable, to withdraw their consent to use of their personal data (which will not affect the legality of any processing that happened before your request takes effect).<br>\n</p>\n<p>People who live in the UK or elsewhere in the European Economic Area (and certain other people) have additional rights to opt out of our use of personal data for direct marketing.\nThey can exercise their rights to opt out, or to object to other processing, by contacting us as described below.\nEvery individual has the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority where they reside.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Individuals and data protection supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may contact our data protection representatives according to Articles 27 EU and UK GDPR:<br>\n</p>\n<p>EU: DP-Dock GmbH, Attn: SmugMug Inc., Ballindamm 39, 20095 Hamburg, Germany<br>\n</p>\n<p>UK: DP Data Protection Services UK Ltd., Attn: SmugMug Inc., 16 Great Queen Street, Covent Garden, London, WC2B 5AH, United Kingdom<br>\n</p>\n<p>https://www.dp-dock.com<br>smugmug@gdpr-rep.com<br>\n</p>\n<p>Additional Privacy Details for California Residents<br>\n</p>\n<p>The sections below apply to \u201cpersonal information\u201d about California residents, as that term is defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and they supplement the information in the rest of our Privacy Policy above.\nThese sections also do not apply to Photographer Personal Data (defined further above as user-uploaded images, videos and certain content relating to such images and videos), even when such data is about a resident of California, because SmugMug is a \u201cservice provider\u201d for such data under the CCPA.<br>\n</p>\n<p>CCPA categories of California personal information we collect:<br>\n</p>\n<p>In the main part of our Privacy Policy, we describe the specific pieces of personal information we collect from and about California residents.\nThis information generally falls into the following CCPA categories, to the extent that any of the following are personally identifiable: identifiers (such as name, address, email address and other contact information).\ncommercial information (such as transaction data, and information about an individual\u2019s interactions with SmugMug).\ncategories of personal information described in California Civil Code 1798.80(e) (such as name).\ncharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law (such as gender).\ninternet or other network or device activity, and other information described in the Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies section of our Privacy Policy.\ngeolocation information.\nprofessional or employment related data (such as title).\nand other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you.<br>\n</p>\n<p>CCPA description of uses of California personal information:<br>\n</p>\n<p>In CCPA terms, we have used and disclosed (and in the past 12 months have used and disclosed) all of the categories of California personal information that we collect for the purposes described in the Use of Information section of our Privacy Policy, though some uses and disclosures were more indirect than others.\nThe extent to which our service providers engage in the uses and disclosures described above varies from provider to provider.<br>\n</p>\n<p>CCPA \u201csale\u201d of California personal information<br>\n</p>\n<p>SmugMug does not \u201csell\u201d and has not \u201csold\u201d its personal information in the way most people understood those words before the CCPA was passed.\nWe don\u2019t sell copies of our user lists like a data broker would, for example.\nAnd while we\u2019ve built a great home for photographers to promote their own creations, we don\u2019t take money for letting unrelated third parties target advertisements to our users.<br>\n</p>\n<p>However, the CCPA defines \u201csell\u201d and \u201csold\u201d in an unconventional, vague and controversial way that has sparked extensive debate and disagreement within the legal and business communities.\nThe CCPA requires businesses that \u201csell\u201d personal information, as the term \u201csell\u201d is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such \u201csales.\u201d Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a \u201csale\u201d under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.\nSome take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.\nIf you take the position that any of those relationships involve a \u201csale\u201d within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider SmugMug to have \u201csold\u201d what the CCPA calls \u201cidentifiers\u201d (like IP addresses), \u201cinternet or other electronic network activity information\u201d (like information regarding an individual\u2019s browsing interactions on smugmug.com), and \u201ccommercial information\u201d (like the fact that a browser visited a page directed to people who are considering purchasing from us) to those sorts of companies.\nAs we await clarity on this point and, if applicable, the arrival of a reasonable method for handling CCPA-like choice options for it, we continue to offer individuals the opportunity to opt out of the use of certain third-party cookies and similar technology for analytics and advertising purposes, as described in the Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others section of our Privacy Policy.<br>\n</p>\n<p>California Privacy Rights<br>\n</p>\n<p>This section describes rights under California law, but we plan to accept requests under this law from non-Californians, to the extent practicable and legally permissible.\nCalifornia law may permit you to request that we:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide you with a list of the categories of personal information we have collected or disclosed about you in the last twelve months.\nthe categories of sources of such information.\nthe business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.\nand the categories of third parties with whom we disclosed and (if applicable) \u201csold\u201d personal information in the CCPA sense.</li>\n<li>Provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you.</li>\n<li>Delete certain information we have about you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain information is exempt from such requests under applicable law.\nYou also may have the right to receive information about the financial incentives that we offer to you (if any).\nYou also have certain rights under the CCPA not to be subject to certain negative consequences for exercising CCPA rights.<br>\n</p>\n<p>To exercise any rights relating to \u201cPhotographer Personal Data\u201d, including (i) the images and videos that a user uploads to or creates in the Services or Products, or (ii) any labels, tags, comments, descriptions or categorizations that user adds to those images and videos in the Services or Products, users should contact the relevant user, and not

that reduce the charge to the customer for Products purchased and/or branding tools, boutique packaging and other services that increase your cost to SmugMug for the Products sold.\nThese discounts and services may result in the total amount paid by such customer to fall below what you owe SmugMug for that order.\nIn such case, you will be liable for reimbursing SmugMug for the difference between the amount paid by such customer and what you owe SmugMug for that order and, in the case of a print credit, for SmugMug's stated share of the markup on such order.\nYou hereby authorize

directly reimbursing SmugMug for all such amounts by any designated payment method that SmugMug deems appropriate (including by reducing your Profit Payments).\nYour failure to provide such reimbursement to SmugMug may result in SmugMug pursuing legal action against you in order to recover such amounts.<br>\n<br>Any Profit Payments that you earn through your participation in the Profit Program will be paid to you in connection with the preferences and user settings available in your Account Settings.\nAny Profit Payments will be paid via electronic bank deposit for all U.S.\nSmugMug

otherwise disputes or changes any order made in connection with the Profit Program (including, but not limited to, the return or destruction of physical Products), SmugMug may adjust any current or future Profit Payments to which you are entitled to reflect such refund, dispute or change.\nIf you do not have a current balance of unpaid Profit Payments sufficient to cover the amount at issue in such refund, dispute or change, you will be responsible for directly reimbursing SmugMug for all such amounts by any designated payment method that SmugMug deems appropriate.\nYour failure to provide such refunded, disputed or changed Profit Payment amount to SmugMug may result in SmugMug pursuing legal action against you in order to recover such amounts.<br>\n<br>SmugMug is entitled to withhold payment of current or future earned fees under the Profit Program, recover any refunded, disputed or changed Profit Payments as set forth above (including any amounts owed by you to SmugMug arising out of the use of coupons, discounts, branding tools, boutique packaging and other services as set forth above) and/or suspend or terminate your participation in the Profit Program if you violate

you no longer qualify for the Profit Program for any reason (e.g., you downgrade your Subscription Plan), you are no longer eligible to participate in the Profit Program.\nIn the event of such termination, SmugMug will pay you any outstanding earned Profit Payments if (i) you have provided SmugMug with valid and current Tax Information and Payment Information and (ii) your outstanding Profit Payment amount exceeds the cost of SmugMug's processing fees for such payment.\nIf you do not provide SmugMug with valid and current Tax Information and Payment Information prior to the termination, cancellation, downgrade or other applicable change to your Subscription, or if your outstanding Profit Payment amount does not exceed the cost of SmugMug's processing fees for such payment, you thereby forfeit and waive your rights to any Profit Payments that you have earned as a participant in the Profit Program.\nIN THE EVENT OF SUCH FORFEITURE, YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT SMUGMUG

participation in the Profit Program.\nAs such, you acknowledge that any Profit Payments belong to you and not to SmugMug.\nThe Profit Payments represent the only compensation payable by SmugMug to you in connection with your participation in the Profit Program and no other compensation of any kind is payable to you for participating in the Profit Program.\nIn certain jurisdictions, SmugMug may be required to withhold, collect and/or remit certain sales or other taxes in connection with the purchase of Products or your participation in the Profit Program and any such taxes will reduce the
