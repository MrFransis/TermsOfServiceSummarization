work of the Foundation has two distinct remits: as an operating charity responsible for the care and management of Waddesdon Manor on behalf of the National Trust and undertaking more general

or usage for direct marketing by those organisations unless you consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal data supplied by Grant applicants, and current or former grant recipients</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will only ask for as much information as we need to effectively consider a grant application, to manage an awarded grant if you are successful and to monitor its progress.\nBy submitting an application, you are agreeing to us processing your data for these purposes and in the ways outlined in this section.\nTo collect information, The Rothschild Foundation uses email and set grants forms (via an online portal, web form(s) or in Microsoft Word or PDF format) to capture and process personal data in line with our review and approval policies.&nbsp.\nGrant applications are saved within our grants database (Blackbaud Grantmaking), which is compliant with UK GDPR.\nThe Blackbaud privacy policy can be viewed on the Blackbaud website.</p>\n<p>You may also choose to sign up to our Email newsletter which is sent via MailChimp and is solely administered by Rothschild Foundation staff.\nThe MailChimp privacy policy can be found on the MailChimp website.</p>\n<p>We will keep a record of applications to enable us to maintain records of your application history should you apply again, including assessment notes.\nIn addition to application data, we will retain all personal data related to the administration or operation of the grant, including (not limited to): applicant name, email address and phone number.</p>\n<p>We may use third&nbsp;party or external assessors, advisors, consultants, judges or working group members to assist us with the grant application and management process, including evaluation and research activities.\nBefore data is shared with any party, we ensure a data processing agreement (Data Protection Impact Assessment or DPIA) is completed which confirms the standard of UK GDPR is in place.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data about what we fund</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Rothschild Foundation publishes limited information (that contains no personal data) in its annual accounts which are submitted to Companies House and the Charity

may contact us for a reference.\nMost information will be organisational and not personal, but at times personal data (for example the names of senior staff) may be included.\nThis is a legitimate
