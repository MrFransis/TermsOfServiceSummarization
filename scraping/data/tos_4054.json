persistent cookies <p>We use the so-called \u201csession cookies\u201d, which are stored exclusively during the time of your visit to any of our websites.</p>\n<p>In addition, we and our partners use \"persistent cookies\" to withhold information about those users who repeatedly access any of our websites.</p> Analytical, advertising cookies...\n<p>We use personalized advertising cookies (which we will talk about below) and web analytics cookies, to know the number of visitors to the different pages and sections of our website, their interactions and duration of their visits, place of entry and

www.freepikcompany.com) in the cookie table at the end of this text.</p> Information on the processing of data shared with our advertising partners Preliminary information <p>In the field of online advertising, cookies and other similar technologies allow website visitors to be recognized or singled out (but not identified in the traditional sense of the word, that is, by their names, surnames, ID number or email address) and classified into groups or \"audiences\" based on their interests.</p>\n<p>Knowing your interests and personalizing the advertising displayed to you in accordance with them is possible thanks to the use of these cookies and similar technologies.</p> Third-parties advertising <p>We allocate the exploitation of our advertising spaces to companies that market them to third parties who then insert their advertisements on our website, depending on your habits and interests.</p>\n<p>Consequently, Freepik offers its advertising spaces based on real-time biddings through two channels or platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google AdManager and</li>\n<li>Various platforms that also market our advertising spaces among their own partners through header bidding techniques (Rubicon Project, Index Exchange, DistrictM, Amazon APS, OpenX).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through these real-time biddings, companies interested in our advertising spaces, bid to display their ads on our website, customizing their advertising based on the user.</p>\n<p>Freepik logically benefits from the advertising displayed, enables the collection of user information through cookies and captures their consent to this extent through its websites.\nBut here is where our intervention and responsibility ends.</p>\n<p>Freepik cannot and indeed does not control the advertisements displayed, nor does it participate in the data processing operations carried out on these platforms to select the user receiving the ads and the advertiser placing such ads.</p>\n<p>For these purposes, and to guarantee the quality of both the advertising and the advertisers, Freepik only markets its advertisement space with the leading platforms worldwide (IAB those others mentioned in the cookies policy), as previously stated.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about Google AdManager and the Header Bidding service providers, in their respective links as provided below.</p>\n<p>You can browse the full list of IAB Europe partners (advertisers) here.</p> You can prevent targeted advertising from being specifically shown to you on Freepik websites in the following ways: <p>Through our cookie setting panel: by granularly accepting or rejecting the different categories of cookies used, you can authorize or not the processing of your data for the purposes of profiling you, the placing of personalized advertising, and the rest of the processing operations described hereby.</p>\n<p>You can also disable cookies in your browser by installing a plug-in as Ghostery or Privacy Badger or through a rejection system (\"opt-out\") provided by some third parties that install cookies on our website, as Google (behavioral advertising) (requires Google log-in).</p> Adobe\u2019s advertising <p>\n<b>Freepik, in turn, offers third-party advertising (Adobe), and tracks its users through</b> Google Analytics when they click on its advertising banners, to check the performance in terms of conversion rate on that advertiser's website.</p> Freepik advertising <p>\n<b>Freepik maintains an \u201caffiliate\u201d advertising program</b> on different websites that will redirect its users to our website when they click on our banners or advertisements.\nWe verify and track the performance of our affiliates through the software tool Postaffiliate Pro.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Moreover, Freepik contracts personalized advertising services of</b> Pinterest, Google Ads and Bing Ads to attract potential new users to our websites who have been profiled by such platforms according to their interests.\nFreepik selects, among these profiles, those who we understand may be interested in our products (for example, those users who had visited our websites, or users within a determined age or geographical location).</p>\n<p>These platforms integrate \"cookies\" and other technologies on our website.\nThese technologies allow them, after you have provided consent, to track, for example, whether their users have only accessed Freepik\u2019s websites to just quit, they have downloaded any products or have become Premium users.</p>\n<p>Then, they provide us with this information in an aggregated and anonymous way to bill us accordingly, allowing us to better understand the price and profitability of our advertising campaigns on each platform.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we may show advertisements to visitors who have left our website, for example without registering, to try to convince them to do so (retargeting techniques).</p>\n<p>Regarding these data processing operations, Freepik is a \"joint controller\" together with each of those platforms, in relation to (i) the selection of the interests of its users to whom we request our advertising is displayed.\n(ii) their monitoring and observation on our websites.\nand (iii) the provision of statistical and aggregated data to Freepik on the result of these campaigns, that is, the conversion rate , if applicable, into our clients.</p>\n<p>All these processing operations are carried out without Freepik being able to identify you: we only identify you when you register as a free or premium user.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, Freepik does not participate in and therefore is not a controller of the processing operations that advertisers and platforms carry out for their own purposes, either prior or subsequent to those other processing operations carried out together with Freepik.</p> International data transfers <p>Regarding Freepik advertising, by using Facebook and Google services, we participate in the international transfer of personal data to countries with a potentially lower level of protection than that imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation.\nThese international transfers are therefore based on standard contractual clauses.</p>\n<p>In relation to third-party advertising, Freepik's controllership is limited to the duties of providing information and obtaining our website visitors\u2019 consent for the purpose of using their cookies to show personalized advertising.\n</p> Additional Information <p>Below, and in the corresponding cookie tables, Freepik provides you with the links to the information offered by each of these companies and platforms regarding the joint controllership situations already described and their own processing operations (lawful bases, international data transfers carried out, retention periods or the exercise of a right of access, erasure, restriction of processing, portability and rectification).</p>\n<p>We remind you again that you can exercise your rights of access, restrictions of processing and / or erasure in relation to the processing of your personal data carried out jointly with the aforementioned platforms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Through our email rpd@freepik.com, if you are a registered user of Freepik.</li>\n<li>And otherwise, before the platforms in which you have a user account (because we will not be able to identify you).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Pinterest</b>: Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy </p>\n<p>\n<b>Google</b>: Privacy Policy and Cookies Policy </p>\n<p>\n<b>Microsoft Bing</b>:
