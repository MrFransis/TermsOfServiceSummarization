web server.\nThis is technically always necessary.\nThen, our server needs your IP address to send responses (e.g.\nwebsite content) to your browser.\nBy default, we do not process any other personal data of you.\nThe legal basis for the processing your IP address and user agent is Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nOur legitimate interest is to provide our content if you want to access it.\n</p> Session identifiers <p> While currently logged in, we keep a temporary session identifier on your computer that your software uses to prove your authentication state.\nThis is erased immediately after you log out or the session expires.\nWe do not use these identifiers to track your visit or evaluate how you use the services provided by us.\n<br> We do not use any third party cookies or tracking of any kind.\n</p> Logging <p> By default, no identifiable data such as IP addresses of any user for any service are retained.\nTo fix problems or stop attacks, it may be necessary to temporarily store access or error logs.\nIf this is the case we store data such as but not limited to a timestamp, your IP, your useragent and the URL you access.\nThe data collected is kept for as long as is necessary to resolve the problem, but for a maximum of 24 hours.\nThis is different for the email server! Full maillogs (they include IP address and maybe other informations like your client) are kept for 24 hours.\nThis is needed to prevent abuse (spam, malware) and to get aware of issues with remote mailservers (bounces, blacklisting).\n</p> E-Mail Support <p> The content and the fact of any mail will not be connected to any of your accounts expect you tell us in an email which account you are using.\nWe periodically delete old requests that are closed (at the latest after one year).\n</p> Registration data <p> When you register an account with us, we collect and process certain personal
