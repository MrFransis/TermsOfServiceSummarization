our tracking of your video viewing through online services or third-party social media for up to two years, or as otherwise permitted by applicable law, or until you withdraw your

advertising\n<p>When you use our online services, we (and our vendors who provide services to us) may collect information about your activities so that we can provide you with advertising tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Because we take part in advertising (\u201cad\u201d) networks, you may see certain ads on other websites.\nAd networks allow us to target the information we send you based on your interests, other information related to you, and contextual means.\nThese ad networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through use of cookies, web beacons, and web-server logs.\nThe ad networks use this information to show you advertisements that may be of particular interest to you.\nThe ad networks we take part in may collect information about your visits to websites that also take part in the relevant ad network, such as the pages or advertisements you view and how you use the websites.\nWe use this information, both on our online services and on third-party websites that take part in the ad networks, to provide you with advertising tailored to you, and to help us assess how effective our marketing is.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of targeted advertising by visiting&nbsp;the Digital Advertising Alliance website&nbsp;or&nbsp;the Network Advertising Initiative website&nbsp;.\nIf you choose to opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements but they will not be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Back to Top</u>\n</p> 7.\nLinks to Other Websites and Social Media\n<p>Our online services may offer links to websites that are not run by us but by third parties.\nIf you visit one of these linked websites, you should read the website\u2019s privacy policy, terms and conditions, and their other policies.\nWe are not responsible for the policies and practices of third parties.\nAny information you give to those organizations is dealt with under their privacy policy, terms and conditions, and other policies.</p>\n<p>We may also have providers of other apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our online services, such as Facebook \u201cLike\u201d buttons, which may also use automated methods to collect information about how you use these features.\nThese organizations may use your information in line with their own policies.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Back to Top</u>\n</p> 8.\nInformation Security\n<p>We are committed to taking appropriate measures designed to keep your personal information secure.\nOur technical, organizational and physical procedures are designed to protect personal information from accidental, unlawful or unauthorized loss, access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction.\nWhile we make efforts to protect our information systems, no website, mobile application, computer system, or transmission of information over the internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Back to Top</u>\n</p> 9.\nRetention\n<p>We keep your

records policies reflect applicable laws.\nWe will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this statement.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Back to Top</u>\n</p> 10.\nInternational

information of our customers.\nThe below is meant to provide additional information regarding our privacy practices in the United States.</p>\nChildren\u2019s Privacy Notice\n<p>We understand how important it is to protect your privacy when you use our online services.\nWe are especially committed to protecting the privacy of children who visit or use our online services.\nThis section (children's privacy notice) is designed to answer your questions about how we use the personal information we collect from children under the age of 13 when they use our online services.</p>\nA.\nWhat personal information do you collect?<br>\n<p>We offer many features on our sites, such as games and coloring books, which children do not have to provide any personal information.\nHowever, sometimes we may collect personal information, such as an email address, a postal address or phone number, from your child as part of an activity.</p>\n<p>Here are two examples of information we collect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect your child's email address so that we can tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake.\nWe will tell them using the email address they have given us.\nWe will not keep the email address beyond its expiration or use it for any other purpose.</li>\n<li>We may collect your child's email address to respond to a one-off request from them, such as to send them a screen saver.\nIn these cases we will promptly delete their email address from our system once we have replied to them, and we will not use the address for any other purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 13 without the permission of a parent or guardian.\nIf we need this permission, we will collect your email address so we can tell you how we use information and get your permission to collect information from your child.</p>\n<p>We will only ask a child for information that is reasonably necessary for them to take part in any online activity.</p>\nB.\nHow do you use the personal information you collect?<br>\n<p>We use the email address your child gives us to respond to requests or to tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake they have entered.\nWe will use your email address to give you details about how we use personal information or to get your permission.</p>\nC.\nHow do you share personal information?<br>\n<p>We may share your child's personal information with other people or organizations if it is reasonably necessary, in the following circumstances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To protect the security or integrity of our online services.</li>\n<li>To take precautions against liability.</li>\n<li>If we have to reveal the information by law or in response to requests from government authorities.</li>\n<li>When we believe sharing the information is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss.</li>\n<li>In connection with an investigation of suspected or actual crime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also may share your child\u2019s personal information with vendors (those who provide services for us).\nThese services may include hosting our sites, providing technical services, meeting requests or managing a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstake.\nWe do not allow these vendors to share the personal information we give them unless it is necessary for them to carry out the service for us.</p>\nD.\nRequests from parents about protecting children's privacy<br>\n<p>You can review personal information we have collected from your child that has not been deleted, and can ask us to delete personal information from our records if we have not already done so.\nYou can also refuse to allow us to further collect or use your child's personal information, even if you have previously given us your permission.\nTo do this, please email or write to us (our contact details are below).</p>\nE.\nWho should I contact with questions about children\u2019s privacy?<br>\n<p>We urge parents to regularly monitor and supervise their children's online activities.\nIf you have any questions about our children\u2019s privacy practices, please contact us at:</p>\n<p>Privacy at McDonald's, Dept.\n282<br>\n110 North Carpenter Street<br>\nChicago, IL 60607-2101,

of your age, then under California law you may request and obtain removal of certain content or information you have posted on our online services.\nTo do so, please contact us at the address, phone number or email address below.\nPlease note that removal does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content.\nFor example, removal may not be possible or permitted if another provision of law requires the content to be maintained, if it was posted or reposted by others, or if we paid compensation to you in exchange for the posting.</p>\nAdditional Notice for California

personal information do you collect?<br>\n<p>We offer many features on our sites, such as games and coloring books, which children do not have to provide any personal information.\nHowever, sometimes we may collect personal information, such as an email address, a postal address or phone number, from your child as part of an activity.</p>\n<p>Here are two examples of information we collect.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect your child's email address so that we can tell them if they have won or lost a contest, competition, prize draw or sweepstake.\nWe will tell them using the email address they have given us.\nWe will not keep the email address beyond its expiration or use it for any other purpose.</li>\n<li>We may collect your child's email address to respond to a one-off request from them, such as to send them a screen saver.\nIn these cases we will promptly delete their email address from our system once we have replied to them, and we will not use the address for any other purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not collect other personal information from a child under the age of 13 without the permission of a parent or guardian.\nIf we need this permission, we will collect your email address so we can tell you how we use information and get your permission to collect information from your child.</p>\n<p>We will only ask a child for information that is reasonably necessary for them to take part in any online activity.</p>\nB.\nHow do you use the personal information you collect?<br>\n<p>We use the email address your child gives us to respond to requests or to

law or in response to requests from government authorities.</li>\n<li>When we believe sharing the information is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss.</li>\n<li>In connection with an investigation of suspected or actual crime.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also may share your child\u2019s personal information with vendors (those who provide services for us).\nThese services may include hosting our sites, providing technical services, meeting requests or managing a contest, competition, prize draw, or sweepstake.\nWe do not allow these vendors to share the personal information we give them unless it is necessary for them to carry out the service for us.</p>\nD.\nRequests from parents about protecting children's privacy<br>\n<p>You can review personal information we have collected from your child that has not been deleted, and can ask us to delete personal information from our records if we have not already done so.\nYou can also refuse to allow us to further collect or use your child's personal information, even if you have previously given us your permission.\nTo do this, please email or write to us (our contact details are

other processes that could be available to you, such as court actions or administrative proceedings.\nIt also means that you are waiving your rights to a trial by jury or to combine your dispute with others in a class action.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The online services are not intended to be used by, or targeted to, anyone under the age of 13 years old.\nYou must be at least 13 years old to use the online services.\nIf you are at least 13 years old but not yet 18 years old (or the legal age of majority if different in your jurisdiction), then you must review these terms with your parent or guardian and they must understand and agree to these terms in order for you to use the online services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you or your parent or guardian do not agree to these terms, then you must immediately stop using the online services and request that McDonald\u2019s close any online services account that you have created.\nYou can request account deletion by sending an email to contact.privacy@us.mcd.com, please include the email address of the account that you want deleted.</p>\n1.\nAbout the online services.\nAvailability of products and services.\n<p>McDonald's products and services are available in many parts of the world.\nHowever, the online services may describe products and services that are not available worldwide.</p>\nObey the rules of the road.\n<p>Whenever you use the online services, you must obey the rules of the road and all applicable rules and regulations.\n<b>You must not use the online services while driving or while behind the wheel or controls of a vehicle that is moving or not in \u201cpark\u201d</b>.\nIn the interest of safety at all times, you should only use the online services when it is lawful and safe to do so.</p>\nYou are responsible for your devices and accounts.\n<p>You are responsible for any devices, software and services needed to use the online services.\nMcDonald\u2019s does not guarantee that the online services will fully function on any particular device or with any particular software.\nYou are also responsible for any messaging and data charges, fees and taxes for your use of the online services, including when we communicate with you by text, email or other means that you choose.\nYou may only use the online services with devices that you own or control and using only the authorized operating system (e.g., Apple iPhone OS for Apple devices).\nIf you create an online services account, you are responsible for keeping the account secure and for all activity under the account.\nYou can only use one online services account and must keep your account information accurate at all times.</p>\nMcDonald\u2019s right to update or terminate the online services.\n<p>You understand and consent that (with or without notice) McDonald\u2019s may update, modify or terminate the online services (or your access to them) from time to time, including by pushing updates to (or removing functionality or access from) any McDonald\u2019s mobile app that you have installed on your device.</p>\nUpdates to these terms.\n<p>McDonald's may also update these terms at any time and at its sole discretion.\nIf McDonald\u2019s makes material changes to the terms, we will notify you by any reasonable means such as by posting the new terms in

created.\nTo close your account, you can visit www.mcdonalds.com/contact or email us at contact.privacy@us.mcd.com.</p>\nIndependent businesses own and operate many restaurants.\n<p>While McDonald\u2019s operates and controls the online services, it is not responsible for the operation of most restaurants.\nMost restaurants are instead owned and operated by independent franchisees of McDonald\u2019s and some are operated by McDonald\u2019s subsidiaries (such franchisees and subsidiaries are together, \u201crestaurants\u201d).\nEach restaurant is solely and independently responsible for its legal and regulatory compliance, for any issues relating to the supply of the products to you, and for any employment related matters in the restaurant.</p>\nLinks to job opportunities from the online services.\n<p>McDonald's and all restaurants are equal opportunity employers committed to diverse workforces.\nThe online services may provide links to job opportunities posted by McDonald\u2019s or restaurants.\nThese opportunities are with the restaurant alone and not with McDonald\u2019s or its parent company (McDonald\u2019s Corporation).\nThis means that the restaurant that posted the opportunity is alone responsible for setting the job requirements, all hiring decisions, and all other employment related matters in its business.\nNeither McDonald\u2019s nor its parent company receives a copy of any application you submit to a restaurant that is a franchisee, neither controls whether you receive an interview or are hired, and neither controls franchisees\u2019 employment policies and practices.\nNeither McDonald\u2019s nor its parent company employs independent franchisees.\nIf you are hired by a restaurant that is a franchisee, only that franchisee, and not McDonald\u2019s or its parent company (McDonald\u2019s Corporation), will be your employer.</p>\nHow to contact us.\n<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding the online services, please refer to the Contact Us section in the online services or you can always visit www.mcdonalds.com/contact.</p>\n2.\nOur information practices and communications with

generally.\n<p>You have a choice in how we communicate with you.\nYou can generally find your communication preferences with instructions on how to opt out in the profile section of the online service that you use.\nYou may also have the ability to change your communication preferences using your device settings.\nIn addition, our communications themselves may include the opportunity to opt out.\nYou understand and agree that you may need to separately manage your communication preferences for each communication method.\nFor example, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if you\u2019ve opted in to receiving them.\nWhile we do our best to offer convenient methods for you to manage your communications preferences, you may need to separately adjust your preferences for each online service.\nPlease note that for some account-related and transactional communications, the only way to stop receiving these communications may be to close your online services account.\nLastly, please note that if you are receiving communications from a McDonald\u2019s franchisee, then you will need to opt out from them directly.</p>\nAdditional information on text messages.\n<p>When you opt in to any of our text message programs, you understand that such text message programs are separately governed by&nbsp;McDonald\u2019s Text Messaging Program Terms &amp.\nConditions.\nYou understand and consent that you will receive text messages from an automated system.\nYou further understand that your consent is not required to make any

applies to any orders you place using the online services.\nPlease read this section before you send any orders to restaurants using the online services.\nPlease note that ordering may not be available in all online services.\nPlease refer to the FAQs for more information on ordering.</p>\nAbout ordering.\n<p>The purpose of ordering is to provide customers with a convenient way of building orders for products in advance and submitting their orders by checking in at a participating restaurant.\nYou must register an online services account in order to use ordering.\nBefore you submit an order, you must register a credit card or debit card (either one, a \u201cpayment card\u201d) to use with your orders.\nNot all restaurants may choose to make their products available via ordering.\nYou may need to enable location services on your device in order for ordering to function properly.</p>\nRegistering your payment method.\n<p>McDonald\u2019s and the restaurants use third party providers to securely store your payment card information and process your payments to restaurants.\nYou understand and agree that, when you register a payment card, McDonald\u2019s or its third party providers may verify that the payment card you registered is valid.\nYou also understand and agree that when you use ordering to make a purchase from a restaurant, that restaurant will be the merchant of record.\nRestaurants may require information other than your order code to verify your purchase.\nYou represent and warrant that you are of sufficient age and have all legal rights to use all payment cards you register.</p>\nYou purchase products directly from restaurants.\n<p>When you use ordering, you submit orders directly to a participating restaurant and the contract for supplying the products will be between you and the restaurant that accepts your order.\nThe restaurant where you collect your products is responsible for preparing the products and providing them to you.\nYou further understand and agree that you are purchasing directly from restaurants (and not McDonald\u2019s or any other Members of the McDonald\u2019s system) and that neither McDonald\u2019s nor any other Members of the McDonald\u2019s System have any responsibility arising out of or related to any products that you purchase from restaurants using ordering.\nMcDonald\u2019s Corporation (which is McDonald\u2019s parent company), its subsidiaries, affiliates, their franchisees, agents, representatives, and agencies and their officers, directors, and employees are together, \u201cMembers of the McDonald\u2019s System\u201d.</p>\nAbout the products in the online services.\n<p>All products are subject to availability at the restaurant where you collect your order.\nSome restaurants do not sell all products.\nImages of products and packaging on the online services are examples only and may not be identical to the product or packaging you receive from a restaurant.\nDifferences may be due your device\u2019s display of colors or factors such as the ingredients used, the supplier, the region of the country, and the season of the year.</p>\nAbout the prices in ordering.\n<p>Each restaurant independently determines its own prices and independently applies any additional taxes and fees as required by law.\nCertain offers and pricing may not be available for all orders at all locations.\nIn the event you discover an error in the price of a product charged to you, please contact the restaurant where you purchased the product to seek a refund of the difference.</p>\nBuilding, confirming and sending your order to a restaurant.\n<p>You can use ordering to build your order and send it to a participating restaurant that you select.\nYou do not make your purchase until you check in at a restaurant, and your payment card will not be charged until you check in at a restaurant.\nOrders made must be collected in person from the restaurant.</p>\nChecking in at a restaurant and making your purchase.\n<p>You can check in at any participating restaurant, even if you selected a different restaurant when you built your order.\nYou make your purchase from a restaurant when you complete your check in at that restaurant.</p>\nUpdated order totals at check-in.\n<p>Updated order totals at check-in can result from changes in products, pricing, taxes or other fees required by law due to your arrival at a different participating restaurant than you originally selected.\nUpdated order totals can also result from the unavailability of certain products, changes in price, or other reasons.</p>\nPaying for your order.\n<p>You make your purchase when you complete your check in at a restaurant.\nWhen you complete your check in, you authorize the restaurant to process your order total (and if updated, your updated order total).\nThe restaurant\u2019s payment service provider will process your order total amount (and if updated, your updated order total amount) to the payment card you selected when you built your order.\nYou may receive a notification within the ordering feature that the restaurant has accepted your order and is preparing it.\nYou own the products after you have collected them.</p>\nCancelling your order, refunds and your consumer rights.\n<p>You have the ability to update or abandon your order at any time until you check in your order at a restaurant.\nHowever, once you complete your check in at a restaurant, you cannot cancel it.\nIf you desire to seek a refund for any reason, including if the products are unsatisfactory or other reasons, please contact the restaurant where you purchased the product regarding any refund due to you.\nYour legal rights in this respect are not affected by anything in these terms.</p>\n4.\nDeals.\n<p>You have the possibility of receiving deals through the online services.\nThe following general terms apply to the deals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the deal may only be available through that particular online service and for the product shown and subject to availability, in participating restaurants only, and until the expiration

the McDonald\u2019s System arising from or related to the online services or these terms will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a single arbitrator using JAMS\u2019s Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201crules and procedures\u201d);</li>\n<li>this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16;</li>\n<li>the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by JAMS under its rules and procedures (provided such location is reasonably convenient to you), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed to by you and McDonald\u2019s or other Members of the McDonald\u2019s System;</li>\n<li>the arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be based on these terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the online services;</li>\n<li>the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent with the FAA, and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law;</li>\n<li>no claims shall be arbitrated on a class or representative basis as you and McDonald\u2019s hereby waive the right to assert claims in any class or representative action.\narbitration will therefore only decide the individual claims of you and McDonald\u2019s.\nit is agreed that the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of any other person or party to an arbitration between you and McDonald\u2019s under this provision;</li>\n<li>you and McDonald's empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>in the event that the administrative fees, arbitrator fees and filing fees associated with the arbitration exceed $100 USD, McDonald\u2019s agrees to pay any such administrative, arbitrator and filing fees exceeding $100 on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator.\nIn addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, McDonald\u2019s will pay as much of your fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nand</li>\n<li>with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, subpart (6) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither McDonald\u2019s nor you shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.\nIn such event, you agree to bring any and all claims arising out of or related to these terms or the online services in either the state courts of DuPage County, Illinois or the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n<b>Further, both you and McDonald's agree to waive any right to a trial by jury.</b> Finally, this arbitration provision is reciprocally binding on all parties, such that both you and McDonald\u2019s are required to arbitrate their claims against one another.\nFor more

piloting its MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards program (\u201cMyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards\u201d, or the \u201cprogram\u201d).\nIf you are within those geographical areas, the program may be displayed to you.\nBy using the online services when the program is displayed, you agree to participate in the program as part of your use of the online services.</p>\n<p>These MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards Terms (USA) (the \u201cprogram terms\u201d) apply only if you participate in the program.\nThe program terms are intended to supplement (not change) the Terms and Conditions for McDonald\u2019s Online Services (USA) (the \u201conline services terms\u201d).\nWhen the word \u201cterms\u201d is used without any reference to the \u201cprogram terms\u201d or the \u201conline services terms,\u201d it is meant to encompass both sets of terms.\nAll definitions used in the online services terms apply to these program terms.</p>\n<p>You understand and acknowledge that you have already agreed to the online services terms when you registered and logged into your online services account.\nAlthough the program terms are intended to supplement and not to change the online services terms, in the event of a conflict between the program terms and online services terms that relates to the program itself, the program terms will control.\nIn the event of any other conflict between the program terms and the online services terms, the online services terms will control.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Important</b>: You understand and acknowledge that the terms contain an arbitration agreement, jury and class action waivers, limitations on McDonald\u2019s liability and other provisions that affect your legal rights regarding the online services, including the program as part of the online services.\nPlease carefully read and understand these terms.</p>\nEligibility and enrollment.\n<p>MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards is only open to you if you meet the age requirements for the online services.\nIn order to enroll in MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards, you must register an online services account.\nCustomers who registered an online services account prior to the launch of MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards can enroll in the program by using the online services in the geographical area of the program on or after the launch date of the program.\nWhen you use the online services outside of the geographical area of the program, neither the program nor any points you accumulated in the program will be available to you.</p>\nWhen McCafe\u00ae Rewards expire.\n<p>If you participated in McCafe\u00ae Rewards and have an existing McCafe\u00ae Reward on or before December 27, 2020, then you can redeem that reward on or before February 25, 2021.\nIf you choose to not immediately enroll in MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards and you receive a McCafe\u00ae Reward on or after December 28, 2020, you will have sixty (60) days from the date that the McCafe\u00ae Reward was received to redeem that reward.\nAfter that sixty (60) day period, any existing McCafe\u00ae Reward will expire.</p>\nWhen existing purchases towards McCafe\u00ae Rewards are converted to points.\n<p>If you participated in McCafe\u00ae Rewards and have made purchases as part of McCafe\u00ae Rewards, but have not made enough purchases to receive a McCafe\u00ae Reward, then if you choose to enroll in MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards, your existing purchases qualifying towards a McCafe\u00ae Reward will immediately be converted into MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards points (\u201cpoints\u201d).\nFor each purchase (up to 4 qualifying purchases) under McCafe\u00ae Rewards, 400 Points will be deposited in your account.\nIf you have opted into receiving emails from McDonald\u2019s, you will receive an email alerting you of the number of points added to your account.\nWe will send the email to your email address that you used to create your online services account.</p>\nHow to earn points.\n<p>Once enrolled in the program, when you identify your online services account at the time of purchase, you will earn 100 points for every $1 U.S dollar spent on qualifying purchases.\nYou can identify your online services account at the time of purchase by any way that we recognize, such as: (a) making a purchase using the Mobile Order &amp.\nPay feature of the mobile app, (b) scanning a QR code at a register or kiosk, or (c) giving the code displayed in your account to the restaurant crew person who is taking your order.\nIf you don\u2019t properly identify your online services account before you complete your qualifying purchase, you cannot earn any points for that purchase.</p>\nQualifying purchases.\n<p>A \u201cqualifying purchase\u201d means using the online services to purchase eligible products from a participating restaurant in a manner that properly identifies you as described above.\nQualifying purchases where an active reward, mobile offer, or promotional offer is redeemed will accrue points, but you will only accrue points for U.S.\ndollars actually spent in the transaction.\nFurther, the following are not considered qualifying purchases and will not accrue points: (a) taxes, bag and bottle fees, and other surcharges or fees, and (b) loading any money on a McDonald\u2019s Arch card (gift card), but when a McDonald\u2019s Arch card is used to make a qualifying purchase you will accrue points.</p>\nVerifying your points balance.\n<p>You can check your points balance in your online services account using the McDonald\u2019s app.\nPoints that you earn may not always immediately post to your account.\nYou are responsible to ensure points from your qualifying purchases are correct.\nIf you believe points from your qualifying purchase were incorrectly calculated, you must notify McDonald\u2019s within six (6) months of the qualifying purchase by providing your receipt to McDonald\u2019s Customer Care.\nMcDonald\u2019s has the sole discretion to determine points in your account and McDonald\u2019s has no liability for any delay or failure to correctly credit points to your account.</p>\nExchanging your points for rewards that you choose.\n<p>You can exchange your points for rewards for free products on the Rewards Menu (each a \u201creward\u201d), which you can then use at participating restaurants.\nYou must use the McDonald\u2019s app or other online services in order to exchange your points for rewards.\nIf you have enough points for a reward, the reward will be unlocked in the online services and available for a points exchange.\nPotential rewards for which you don\u2019t have enough points may be displayed but locked.\nOnce you select a reward and exchange your points for it, the number of points for that reward will be temporarily deducted from your account and the reward will be displayed in your account.\nThe reward will temporarily remain in your account until you redeem it for a product, and if you do not, it will be converted back to points.\nWhen you redeem the reward for which you exchanged points, the points will be permanently deducted from your account.\nYou cannot exchange points for more than one reward at a time.\nWhen you redeem your reward for a product, you are obtaining that product directly from the participating restaurant, not from other Members of the McDonald\u2019s system.</p>\nOther ways to earn and redeem.\n<p>From time to time, McDonald\u2019s may offer new and different ways for you to earn and redeem points, including bonus campaigns or points accelerators.\nMcDonald\u2019s has the sole discretion to offer, change and terminate the different ways to earn and redeem points, including for example, the points associated with bonus campaigns and accelerators.\nSometimes earning and redeeming points may be subject to additional terms (\u201cadditional terms\u201d) disclosed at the time of the offer.</p>\nRewards Menu.\n<p>McDonald\u2019s publishes eligible rewards in the online services and identifies how many points are required for each reward.\nThe Rewards Menu may have multiple reward levels and multiple rewards on each level, which can change from time to time.&nbsp.\nMcDonald\u2019s makes no promise of the continued availability of any reward, even if it is displayed to you in the online services.&nbsp.\nRewards are available until supplies last at participating restaurants and may be modified, changed and discontinued at any time.</p>\nPoint expiration.\n<p>Points expire on the first (1st) day of the month after the sixth (6th) month from the date such points were earned.\nPoints will be maintained in your online services account until you exchange your points for a reward, or until they expire, whichever occurs first.&nbsp.\nIf McDonald\u2019s terminates the program, any unused points in your account will expire and be void when the program is terminated.\nUpon termination of your online services account for any reason (including, but not limited to, whether you choose to close your account or McDonald\u2019s terminates your account for a violation of these terms), all points that you have accumulated in MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards will immediately expire.</p>\nYour compliance with the terms.\n<p>McDonald\u2019s has the discretion to invalidate or void points from your online services account, or to suspend or terminate your account (both now and in the future), if McDonald\u2019s believes you improperly obtained points, abused the program or otherwise violated these terms.\nIn that event, you forfeit any points you have accumulated (including properly obtained points) and you forfeit your right to earn points in the future.\nMcDonald\u2019s has the sole discretion to determine your compliance with these terms.\nMcDonald\u2019s determination is final.</p>\nNo rights in points.\n<p>Points are not property and you have no vested right or interest in points.\nPoints have no cash value.\nPoints are not assignable or transferrable between online services accounts or otherwise, and points cannot be combined across accounts, regardless of who registered the account.</p>\nChanges to MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards.\n<p>MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards can change from time to time, so be sure to continue to refer to these terms for the latest details and news.\nWe are also constantly improving the program and we may have exciting new offers.</p>\n<p>McDonald\u2019s reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel, change, modify or discontinue MyMcDonald\u2019s Rewards, in whole or in part, including any terms, rules, features, benefits, rewards, conditions of participation, points accruing or accumulation ratio, the points redemption policy, the points expiration policy, or any other aspect of the program at any time, with or without advance notice, even though changes may affect points and rewards already in your account.</p>\n<p>McDonald\u2019s may make changes to any element of the program to correct for typographical, printing or other errors and you waive any rights relating to same.&nbsp.\nAny changes will become effective immediately upon posting the revisions.&nbsp.\nAt all times, you are solely responsible for remaining knowledgeable about and in compliance with these terms.</p>\nMiscellaneous.\n<p>All rewards offered via the program are subject to availability.\nSome participating restaurants do not sell all products offered as rewards.&nbsp.\nImages of products and packaging of rewards are examples only and may not be identical to the product or packaging you receive from a participating restaurant.</p>\nMcDonald\u2019s Text Messaging Program Terms &amp.\nConditions (USA)\n<p>Last Updated: April 23, 2018<br>\n(non-substantive update for accessibility: May 15,
