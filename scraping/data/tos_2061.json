Law and Venue\n<p>If you are a U.S.\nresident that has acquired Products as a Consumer Purchaser, Exhibit A (\u201cAgreement to Arbitrate \u2013 U.S.\nConsumer Purchaser\u201d) applies.\nIf you are not a U.S.\nresident Consumer Purchaser, this Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to the laws of: (i) the State of California, U.S.A.\nif you obtained the Products from Yubico, Inc..\nand (ii) Sweden if you obtained the Products from Yubico AB.\nIn either event, the choice of law shall be without regard to the conflict of laws provisions

courts located in Sweden, with Stockholm District Court as the court of first instance, when the laws of Sweden apply.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nOther\n<p>The terms and conditions set forth or referenced

bond) to address such a breach, in addition to any other remedies it may have hereunder or at law.\nIf you have any questions regarding this Agreement, you may contact Yubico on our support site at

Consumer Purchaser, you and Yubico agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Software (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an \u201cIP Protection Action\u201d).\nWithout limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Yubico with written notice of your desire to do so by email to legal@yubico.com within 30 days following the date you first purchase or obtain the Software (such notice, an \u201cArbitration Opt-out Notice\u201d).\nIf you don\u2019t provide Yubico with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the 30-day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Client with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\nUnless you timely provide Client with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Yubico are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.\nFurther, unless both you and Yubico otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this Section will survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(b) Arbitration Rules:</b>\n<br>\nThe arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this Section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(c) Arbitration Process:</b>\n<br>\nA party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration and a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents).\nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(d) Arbitration Location and Procedure:</b>\n<br>\nUnless you and Yubico otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Yubico submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(e) Arbitrator\u2019s Decision:</b>\n<br>\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of Section 8 (\u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d) as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nYubico will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>(f) Fees:</b>\n<br>\nYour responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Yubico will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<p>Find<br>\nTake product finder quiz</p>\n<p>Set up<br>\nFind set-up guides</p>\n<p>Buy<br>\nBuy online<br>\nContact
