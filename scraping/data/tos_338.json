Action Waiver\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>If You reside in the EEA/UK/Switzerland/Australia/New Zealand/Turkey/Japan/Brazil</strong> , then only this first paragraph of this Section 15 will apply to You.\nZeniMax will try and solve any disagreements that arise between You and ZeniMax promptly and efficiently.\nYou and ZeniMax may agree to refer any disputed matter to resolution proceedings other than in a court but You and ZeniMax are not restricted from bringing court proceedings at any time.\nThe European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.\nIf you would like to bring a matter to our attention, please contact ODRnotice@zenimax.com.\nWe are not obliged nor willing to participate in dispute settlement proceedings before a consumer arbitration board or scheme.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If You reside outside the EEA/UK/Switzerland/Australia/New Zealand/ Turkey/Japan/Brazil</strong> , then the terms below in this Section 15 apply to You.</p>\n<p>This Section 15 facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between You and ZeniMax.\nArbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.\nYou have the right to opt-out of this Section 15 (as explained below), which means You would retain Your right to file a lawsuit and litigate Your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.\nCertain of the terms below in this Section reference \"class actions\" or \"other collective disputes or representative actions.\" If You reside in a jurisdiction that does not permit class actions or other collective disputes or representative actions, such terms will not apply to You.</p>\n<p>Please read this Section 15 carefully.\nIt provides that You and ZeniMax agree that all Disputes (defined below) between You and ZeniMax shall be resolved by binding arbitration (such agreement is sometimes referred to in this Section as the \" <strong>arbitration agreement</strong>\").\nArbitration replaces the right to go to court.\nIn the absence of this arbitration agreement, You may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions, collective actions or representative actions).\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 15 or applicable law, entering into this arbitration agreement constitutes a waiver of Your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nThe arbitrator must follow this arbitration agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, if otherwise authorized by applicable law).\nThe arbitrator may not award damages disclaimed by these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this Section 15, \" <strong>ZeniMax</strong>\" collectively refers to ZeniMax Media, Inc., its subsidiary and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.\nThe term \" <strong>Dispute</strong>\" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between You and ZeniMax regarding or related to any aspect of Your relationship with ZeniMax, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes, but not limited to, the validity, enforceability or scope of this Section 15 (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).\n\"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</p>\n<p>YOU AND ZENIMAX EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL (AND NOT CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION) ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION 15.</p>\n<p>A.\nPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution.\nFor all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, You must first give ZeniMax an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.\nYou must commence this process by mailing written notification to ZeniMax Media Inc., Attn: Legal Dep't, 1370 Piccard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.\nThat written notification must include (1) Your name, (2) Your address, (3) a written description of Your Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief You seek.\nIf ZeniMax does not resolve the Dispute to Your satisfaction within forty-five (45) days after receipt of Your written notification, You may pursue Your Dispute in arbitration.\nYou may pursue Your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>B.\nExclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.\nNotwithstanding the above, You or ZeniMax may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute is initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (the \" <strong>Opt-Out Deadline</strong>\").\nYou may opt out by mailing written notification to ZeniMax Media Inc., Attn: Legal Dep't, 1370 Piccard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850 USA.\nYour written notification must include (1) Your name, (2) Your address, and (3) a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out will have no adverse effect on Your relationship with ZeniMax.\nYou are responsible for ensuring the ZeniMax's receipt of Your opt out notice, and You therefore may wish to send a notice by means that provide a written receipt.\n<strong>Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and You must pursue Your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>i.\nArbitration Procedures.\nIf this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (\" <strong>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong>\") either You or ZeniMax may initiate arbitration proceedings.\nIf You reside in North America, the American Arbitration Association (\" <strong>AAA</strong>\"), www.adr.org, will arbitrate all Disputes.\nIf You do not reside in North America, the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (\" <strong>ICDR</strong>\"), www.icdr.org, will arbitrate all Disputes.\nThe arbitration taking place before the ICDR will be conducted in English before a single arbitrator.\nIn either case, the arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration.\nThe arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to decide all issues with respect to Section 15, including, but not limited to whether any particular claim asserted by You or ZeniMax falls within the scope of this Section 15 and any alleged ambiguities in this Section 15.</p>\n<p>ii.\nIn Disputes before the AAA, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, and in either instance the AAA's Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.\nThe ICDR's rules will apply to Disputes before that entity.\nAAA and ICDR rules are available at www.adr.org and www.icdr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nThis Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules of the AAA or ICDR.\nBased on the class action waiver set forth in subsection 15(B)(vii) below, under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>\n<p>iii.\nBecause the Services and these Terms of Service concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\" <strong>FAA</strong>\") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>\n<p>iv.\nArbitration Award.\nThe arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law and these Terms of Service, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>\n<p>v.\nLocation of Arbitration.\nIf You reside in North America, You or ZeniMax may initiate arbitration in either Rockville, Maryland, USA or the judicial district that includes the address You provide in Your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution.\nIf You do not reside in North America, the arbitration shall take place in London, England or Sydney, Australia as requested by You.</p>\n<p>vi.\nPayment of Arbitration Fees and Costs.\nZeniMax will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator's costs and expenses upon Your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration or as otherwise required by applicable law.\nYou are responsible for all additional fees and costs that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.\nFees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.\nIn addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if You provide notice and negotiate in good faith with ZeniMax as provided in the section above titled \"Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\" and the arbitrator concludes that You are the prevailing party in the arbitration, You will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>vii.\nClass Action Waiver.\nAny arbitration proceedings initiated pursuant to this Section 15 will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated or representative action or as a member of a class, collective, consolidated or representative action.\n<strong>If You choose to pursue Your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to You.</strong> Neither You, nor any other user of the Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>\n<p>C.\nJury Waiver.\nYou understand and agree that by entering into these Terms of Service You and ZeniMax are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.\nIn the absence of this Section 15, You and ZeniMax might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).\nExcept as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.\nOther rights that You would have if You went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>\n<p>D.\nGoverning Law.</p>\n<p>i.\nFor residents of North America, this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States Federal Arbitration Act and the State of Maryland, USA, excluding its conflicts of laws rules and principles that would result in another State or country's laws applying to these Terms of Service (including this arbitration agreement) or any Disputes, and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>\n<p>ii.\nIf You reside outside of North America, then this arbitration agreement and all Disputes shall be governed by the laws of England, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules and principles that would result in another State or country's laws applying to these Terms of Service (including the arbitration agreement) or any Disputes, and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\nLocal mandatory law may apply.</p>\n<p>E.\nSeverability.\nIf any clause within this Section 15 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 15, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be given full force and effect.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 15 will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>\n<p>F.\nContinuation.\nThis Section 15 shall survive the termination of these Terms of Service and Your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>G.\nModifications.\nNotwithstanding ZeniMax's right to modify these Terms of Service, ZeniMax shall have no right to alter, amend, modify, or revoke this Section 15 (the arbitration
