on the Services that infringes my copyright? <p>In accordance with the DMCA, we\u2019ve adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement.\nWe reserve the right to (1) block access to or

infringement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>3.\n</b>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.\nUnless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company's discretion.\n</p>\n<p>Please contact Railway's Designated Agent at the following address:</p>\n<p>Railway Corporation Attn: DMCA Designated Agent</p>\n<p>80 Rossi Avenue, San Francisco, CA

any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.\nWe cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.\nWe can\u2019t guarantee the identity

<p>We\u2019re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.\nWe\u2019ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn\u2019t always practical.\nWe reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.\n</p>12.\nDo the Services cost anything? <p>The Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services.\nIf you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.\n</p>\n<p> Paid Services.\nCertain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\nPlease see our Paid Services page for a description of the current Paid Services.\nPlease note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Billing.\nWe use a third-party payment processor (the \u201cPayment Processor\u201d) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your \u201cBilling Account\u201d) for use of the Paid Services.\nThe processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms.Currently, we use Stripe, Inc.\nas our Payment Processor.\nYou can access Stripe\u2019s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.\nWe are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor.\nBy choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d).\nYou agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.\nWe reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</p>\n<p>Payment Method.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</p>\n<p>Recurring Billing.\nSome of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.\nBy choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.\nWE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD.\nSUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT.\nTO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS</p>\n<p>Current Information Required.\nYOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT.\nYOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.\nCHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS.IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</p>\n<p>Change in Amount Authorized.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</p>\n<p>Auto-Renewal for Paid Services.\nUnless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.\nTo change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings.\nIf you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.\nHowever, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOURACCOUNT SETTINGSOR TERMINATE YOUR RAILWAY ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM.PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, RAILWAY WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.</p>\n<p>Reaffirmation of Authorization.\nYour non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service.\nWe may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges.\nThis does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.\nYour charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.\n</p>\n<p>Free Trials and Other Promotions.\nAny free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial.\nYou must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service.\nIf you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at support@railway.app.</p>13.\nWhat if I want to stop using the Services? <p>You\u2019re free to do that at any time by contacting us at support@railway.app.\nplease refer to our Privacy Policy , as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.\n</p>\n<p>Railway is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.\nRailway has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>\n<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.\n</p>\n<p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@railway.app \u2013 we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can\u2019t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>\n<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination.\nBy way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.\n</p>14.\nCan I refer other users? <p>From time to time Railway may offer rewards or incentives for referring others to the Services.\nFor details of any current referral offers, please see our referral page.\nThe referring user (\u201cReferrer\u201d) may refer individuals or entities who are neither current customers of Railway nor registered users of the Services (\u201cReferee\u201d).A registered user is a person or entity that already has an existing account with Railway.There is no limit to the number of referrals that Referrer can make, nor the cumulative rewards or incentives that the Referrer may receive through such special offer, unless otherwise indicated.Referrer will receive the stated reward or incentive for each Referee sent by

of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your

IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>Limitation of Liability.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE RAILWAY PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR

($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO RAILWAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>Indemnity.\nTo the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold the Railway Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>\n<p>Assignment.\nYou may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Railway's prior written consent.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>\n<p>Choice of Law.\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Agreement.\nPlease read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Railway and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Railway.\nBoth you and Railway acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Railway's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>\n<p>(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cRules\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>(b) Costs of Arbitration.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nRailway will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nRailway will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\n</p>\n<p>(c) Small Claims Court.\nInfringement.\nEither you or Railway may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n<p>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND RAILWAY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Railway are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Railway over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND RAILWAY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Railway is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.\n</p>\n<p>(f) Opt-out.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 80 Rossi Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94118 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) Exclusive Venue.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Railway to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Railway agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n</p>\n<p>(h) Severability.\nIf the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Railway.</p>\n<p>Miscellaneous.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Railway may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Railway agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Railway, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Railway, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Railway in any respect whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p>Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and Railway agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>", "created_at": "2022-08-17 23:27:07.835132", "updated_at": "2022-08-17
