(Platform as a Service) will let you host your products and services on a dedicated real-time basis, configured and optimized by us, Platform.sh.\nOur end to end complete infrastructure allows you to simply deploy your applications to the cloud without any headaches.</p>\n<p>We automatically configure and run not only your application server but all the services on which it depends (databases, search engines, cache backends, etc.).\nOn top of an easy to navigate web interface, we offer you APIs to control all your third-party integrations and tools.</p>\n<p>\u201cPlatform.sh\u201d is operated by Platform.sh SAS, a French company located at 131, Boulevard de S\u00e9bastopol, Paris, 75002 France, and Platform.sh, Inc.\na Delaware registered corporation, addressed at PO Box 536 Brooklyn, MI 49230 and may include its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, contractors, and/or licensors (together, referred to throughout these Terms of Service as \u201cPlatform.sh\u201d or \u201cus\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d).</p>\n<p>By visiting our site and/ or purchasing something from us, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (\u201cTerms of Service\u201d, \u201cTerms\u201d), including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink, including our Privacy Policy.\nThese Terms of Service apply to all users of the site, including without limitation users who are browsers, vendors, customers, merchants, and/or contributors of content.\nWe offer many services, tools, products, software, and offerings on related Platform.sh websites (the \u201cServices\u201d), including but not limited to, all information, tools and Services available from this website (or \u201csite\u201d) to you (the \u201cuser\u201d, \u201ccustomer,\u201d \u201ccompany\u201d conditioned upon your acceptance of such terms, conditions, policies and notices in or referenced in the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our website.\nBy accessing or using any part of the site, you agree to be bound by these Terms.\nIf you do not agree to all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access the website or use any services.\nIf these Terms of Service are considered an offer, acceptance is expressly limited to these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>METERED AND USAGE BASED: Our Services are bundled in monthly plans, but the actual billing is based on the actual usage you make of our services.\nTo learn more about our self-service plans, please visit our pricing page.</p>\n<p>UPTIME: We try to keep our Services up all the time, but the self-service plans only come with a very limited uptime guarantee of 99.5% (our track record is much higher, but we will not commit to it because not all services run with redundancy).\nMost other providers won\u2019t even commit to this.\nIf you need guaranteed uptime because you depend on your website for your company\u2019s income you should check out our ENTERPRISE offering.</p>\n<p>SUPPORT: The self-service Professional plans do not include personalized support.\nWe do give support, on a best effort basis, through an online service desk, and on public forums.\nWe are sorry but our engineers will simply not take phone calls (if you are using this service you are probably a developer, and do not like taking phone calls either).\nIf your organization needs people they can contact 24/7, again you will need to purchase an optional ENTERPRISE offering (which redefines white gloving, our support staff will be more than happy to talk to you!).\nPlease contact your salesperson for our terms.</p>\n<p>ENTERPRISE SUPPORT: Selected self-service Professional plans do offer an optional enterprise SLA, which provides the following ticket response times through an online service desk: Priority 1 \u2013 Less than 1 hour, Priority 2 &amp.\n3 \u2013 Less than 1 working day.\nThis SLA is offered on an annual term basis, paid for in advance, and is non-refundable.\nFurther details can be found in the specific terms referenced in the Order/Quote form you will need to sign to buy this.</p>\nSECTION 2 - ONLINE SERVICE TERMS\n<p>You may not use our Services for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Services, violate any applicable

our Services, such as product pricing, are subject to change at any time without notice, at our sole discretion.\nWe reserve the right to discontinue any Services at any time.\nAny offers for your products or services made on our site is void where prohibited (for example, on our public forums).</p>\n<p>You commit yourself to choosing one of our Service offerings that meet your needs, or those of your organization or users.\nWe may, in the future, offer new or Platform.sh services and/or features through this website (including, the release of new tools and resources).\nSuch new features or

applicable law, specifically French law, you must clearly be identifiable to third parties in your function as a web host, if you use our services to host public communication services online (notably websites or blogs), regardless of whether you are only an editor to such services.</p>\n<p>Platform.sh Services provides you with a fully autonomous management interface

manage your hosting in real time (and notably publish online, delete, or modify all or some of the content on a real time dedicated basis);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to modify and update your contact information associated with Platform.sh hosting service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some changes may incur additional fees, for which you will be informed and will be subject to your express prior consent.</p>\n<p>You understand that some changes cannot be performed, most notably you may not reduce the amount of storage dedicated to any specific environment or project.\nIn order to reduce storage, you may need to subscribe to a new Platform.sh Service offering and transition the content from the larger one to the smaller one.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, in accordance with these Terms, your access codes, which are private, are under your full and complete responsibility.\nPlatform.sh will not be accountable for misuse by third parties of your account, it is your responsibility to keep such credentials private and safe.</p>\n<p>For the purpose of ensuring the proper operation of its Services, and the safety and stability of the system, Platform.sh may intervene under certain circumstances, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to stop a technical malfunction inherent to our system;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>to carry out a maintenance operation;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in case of trouble

attempts\u2026).\nobvious damage to, or attempt to damage our infrastructure caused by your instance of your software (e.g.\nDDoS, botnet, spamming).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In any event, Platform.sh reserves the right to interrupt some or all of the Services in order to perform a technical intervention, particularly in the case of defective operation, or to improve the operation, or to perform maintenance.\nIn accordance with our 99.5% self-service uptime, we will do everything necessary to limit the time of such interruption as much as possible and, if possible, we will give you reasonable prior notice, indicating the date, type, and duration of the intervention, so that you can make all the necessary arrangements.</p>\n<p>However, you acknowledge that we will not be able to give you prior notice in the case where the Service interruption is due to an external reason, for example emergency security patching (and in particular, one that would be inherent to the internet itself, acts of God, war, terrorism, riot, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, earthquakes, labor strikes, industrial disputes, or fuel crises) or if it is explicitly requested by a competent authority or in application of current French law.</p>\n<p>Platform.sh Professional is intended to be used to host websites, web-applications, and web-APIs with unmetered bandwidth based on fair-use assumptions.\nIt is not intended to be used as a download service or as a Content Delivery Network (CDN).\nAs such, the Services self-service offering currently does not limit the bandwidth you may use, as long as it falls inside the realm of what Platform.sh deems as ordinary usage.\nThe Professional Enterprise offering includes CDN with a 1Tb per month included amount, beyond which overages are chargeable.</p>\n<p>Our development environments share resources between themselves and as such are not intended to be used for production type workloads such as intensive calculations and regular long running jobs.</p>\n<p>Should Platform.sh deem a customer\u2019s account as exceeding fair use bandwidth consumption, or development environment usage, Platform.sh will notify the customer and allow the customer to remedy the problem.\nHowever, should a customer\u2019s\u2019 bandwidth or Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage be significantly greater than what Plaform.sh deems as fair use of the Services, Platform.sh reserves the right to suspend or throttle the customer\u2019s account where appropriate.\nIn such event, Platform.sh will notify you and discuss other available options and Services that could better suited for your use and needs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SSL Certificates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Platform.sh provisions automatically for every site

plans.</p>\n<p>You may not sign up for multiple accounts in order to receive additional Free Trial benefits.\nWe may terminate or suspend a Free Trial at any time without notice or liability, and in our sole discretion, and we reserve the right to adjust pricing relative to any Services offered through a Free Trial.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sponsored Sites</strong>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, at its

non-profit organization\u2019s tax purposes.</p>\nSECTION 6 - FEES AND TERM\n<p>Our monthly plans for Services usually include a certain amount of resources (for example three included development environments or 5GB storage).\nIn the future, we may change those plans, but we will not change the conditions of your subscription without prior notice.\nSuch changes and our notification will never

made.\nWe reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.</p>\n<p>Depending on the total estimated amount for the

void.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, if you reside in a country with laws that give consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts (for example, European Union member states), the
