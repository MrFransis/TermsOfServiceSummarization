process your data for additional purposes which are compatible with any of the purposes listed above.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.2.\nADVERTISING</b>\n</p>\n<p>Advertising is one of the tools that helps fund our Services and enables us to make our Games available free of charge.\nIn some of our Games, we may show our own ads and also ads from third parties.\nWe also advertise our Games outside of our Services on third-party properties such as websites or applications.\nThis section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers.\nAn \u201c<b>Advertising ID</b>\u201d is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of your mobile device (e.g.\nyour phone or tablet).\nIt is consistent across applications from different publishers.\nThe Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (\u201c<b>IDFA</b>\u201d) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (\u201c<b>GAID</b>\u201d) on Android devices.\nAdvertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes.\nYou can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes.\nUsing the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID.\nFor example, you can \u201climit ad tracking\u201d on iOS devices or \u201copt out of interest-based ads\u201d on Android devices.\nThese settings are specific to each device, which means that you should set them as you prefer on each of your devices individually.\nIt may take some time for your updated settings to take effect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please consider that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads or necessarily reduce the number of ads you see, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you and will not be served based on your personal data.<br>\n<br>\n<b>When you see ads in our Games</b>, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners if you have given your consent to the use of your data for personalized ads.\nOur advertising partners may also collect non-personal information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs).\nIn each case, they may use such data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalize the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID).\nFor more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed&nbsp;here.<br>\n<br>\n<b>When you see our ads outside of our Services</b>&nbsp;(for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Services.\nWhen ad-networks use your Advertising ID in these ways, they do so based on their respective privacy policies or notices.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ad networks may also use your data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>limit the number of times you see our ads,</li>\n<li>inform users who have previously played our Games about new content, updates, or other news related to those Games, or</li>\n<li>refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Services</b>, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad.\nMeasurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads.\nThis data is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behavior, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.3.\nCOOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES ON OUR WEBSITE</b>\n</p>\n<p>Like most websites today, our Websites may use cookies or similar technologies (for example, local shared objects or web beacons).\nA \u201c<b>cookie</b>\u201d is a small file your browser stores when told to do so by a website.\nCookies can be set by either the website you visit (\u201c<b>first-party cookies</b>\u201d) or a third party involved in providing content, functionality, or services such as analytics or advertising for the website you visit (\u201c<b>third-party cookies</b>\u201d).\nCookies are typically used to identify or \u201cremember\u201d your device, for example to enable functionality, facilitate audience measurement, improve performance, or store your preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As explained in the cookie banner seen when you first visit the Websites, we may only collect essential (necessary to enable functionality of the Website) and analytical (useful to improve our Websites by using information on its usage) cookies.</p>\n<p>Using your browser or device settings or making a choice through our cookie banner, you can control the use of cookies, for example by disabling some or all cookies or configuring your browser or device to notify you when cookies are being set.\nHowever, please consider that disabling essential cookies may affect your ability to use the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nWHAT DATA DO WE PROCESS?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may process the following data relating to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your name, email address, or
