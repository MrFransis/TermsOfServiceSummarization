Agreement.\nIf you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference.\nThe party initiating the claim must give notice

same or similar claims which arise from the same or substantially identical transactions, incidents, or events requiring the determination of the same or substantially identical questions of law or fact.\nand (3) involve the same or coordinated counsel for the parties.\nIn all other circumstances, the fees set forth in ADR Services, Inc.\u2019s General Fee Schedule shall apply, except that
