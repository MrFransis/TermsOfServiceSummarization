controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration.\nFor United States residents, the arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of Your residence.\nFor international residents, the arbitration will take place within 50 miles of any KIXEYE office.\nAs used in this Section, \"<u>we</u>\" and \"<u>us</u>\" mean KIXEYE and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of its and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives.\nIn addition, \"<u>we</u>\" and \"<u>us</u>\" include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Service or this Agreement (as well as any related or prior agreement that You may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.</p>\n<p>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nThe arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (\"<u>AAA</u>\") with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.\nAs modified by this Agreement, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the \"<u>Rules and Procedures</u>\").\nWhere no claims or counterclaims exceed $10,000, the dispute will be resolved by the submission of documents without a hearing, unless a hearing is requested by a party or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, in which case, a party may elect to participate telephonically.</p>\n<p>You should review this provision carefully.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, You are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend Your rights EXCEPT for matters that You file in small claims court in the state or municipality of Your residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court.\nAdditionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.\nSuch claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.\nAdditionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, You or us may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>\n<p>Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.\nYou are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.\nArbitrators' decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>\n<p>You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n(B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.\n(c) in the event that You are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of Your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration.\n(e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.\n(f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither You nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.\n(g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of this Agreement, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law.\nand (h) You and we will pay our respective attorneys' fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys' fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.</p>\n<p>This Section will survive termination of Your Account and this Agreement as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by You or any bankruptcy by You or us.\nWith the exception of subparts (a) and (b) above of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein.\nIf, however, either subpart (a) or (b) above of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither You nor we will be entitled to arbitration.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.</p>\n<p>For more information on the AAA, the Rules and Procedures, or the process for filing an arbitration claim, You may call the AAA at 888-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at
