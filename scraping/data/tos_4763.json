\u201ccookie\u201d is an element of data that a website can send to your browser when you link to that website.\nIt is not a computer program and has no ability to read data residing on your computer or instruct it to perform any step or function.\nBy assigning a unique data element to each visitor, the website is able to recognize repeat users, track usage patterns and better serve you when you return to that site.\nOur cookies do not extract other personal information about you, such as your name or address.\nYou may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device\u2019s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.\nWe may also use what is known as \u201cclient-side page tagging,\u201d which uses code on each page to write certain information about the page and the visitor to a log when a page is rendered by your web browser.\nThis technique is also commonly used on commercial websites.\n\u201cTagging\u201d does result in a JavaScript program running on your computer, but it is limited to providing information about the page that you are requesting and the configuration of your browser.\nIt will not read any of your data files, or execute any additional programs.\nIt does not extract any personal information about you, such as your name or address.\nYou can prevent tagging by disabling JavaScript in your browser, but that may prevent you from using all of our Site\u2019s functions.\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal, we do not currently respond to browser \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signals.<strong>How do we share Personal Information?</strong>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information
