between virtual and physical reality in which real-world geolocations on a sectioned map correspond to user-generated digital virtual environments.\nOnce fully developed, these environments will be able to be owned, bought, sold and deeply customised and will evolve over time limited only by users\u2019 imaginations.\n</p>\n<p> Earth 2 (and its related bodies corporate) (referred to in this document as we, us or our) recognises that your privacy is very important and we are committed to protecting the personal information we collect from you.\nThe Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act), and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) govern the way in which we manage your personal information and this policy sets out how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise manage personal information about you.\n</p>CollectionTypes of Collection<p> We may collect and hold personal information about you, that is, information that can identify you, and is relevant to facilitating our relationship with you and your use of our website (including the Earth 2 platform).\n</p>\n<p>The kinds of information we typically collect include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Gender</li>\n<li>Phone Number</li>\n<li>Email Address</li>\n<li>User name / Pseudonym and Password</li>\n<li>IP Address</li>\n</ol>\n<p> and other information relevant to providing you with access to our website, the Earth 2 platform and other information or services you request or consent to receive from us.\n</p>\n<p> We may also incidentally collect and hold sensitive information about you, including information about your health, religious beliefs or affiliations, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions and sexual preferences or practices.\nWhile we do not actively collect these from you as part of your use of the website or your transactions in the Earth 2 platform, if you use any of the social elements of the platform, including chat or video functions (if available), this information may be passively collected and stored on our systems, and be viewable by other users.\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge that this is an unavoidable consequence of using the Earth 2 platform in those ways and consent to that collection.\nYou can avoid using those features if you do not consent to that collection.\n</p>Method of Collection<p> Personal information will generally be collected directly from you through the use of any of our standard forms, over the internet (including through our registration page), via email, or through a telephone conversation with you.\nCollection may also occur through your use of the Earth 2 platform (such as through chat or video functions (if available), or by otherwise interacting with other users).\n</p>\n<p> We may also collect personal information about you from third parties acting on your behalf, particularly if you are required to have your parent or guardian act on your behalf.\n</p>\n<p> There may, however, be some instances where personal information about you will be collected indirectly because it is unreasonable or impractical to collect personal information directly from you.\nWe will usually notify you about these instances in advance, or where that is not possible, as soon as reasonably practicable after the information has been collected.\n</p>\n<p> Finally, you should be aware that other users may collect your personal information, such as through screen shots or recording video streams (if available), and this is out of our control.\nUsers are not required to comply with our Privacy Policy and may not be required to comply with privacy laws either as they are acting in a personal capacity.\n</p>Purpose of collection<p> The personal information that we collect and hold about you, depends on your interaction with us.\nGenerally, we will collect, use and hold your personal information if it is reasonably necessary for or directly related to the performance of our functions and activities and specifically for the purposes of: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>providing you with access to our website;</li>\n<li> providing you with access to the Earth 2 platform as a registered user, and related purposes.\n</li>\n<li>enabling transactions to occur within the Earth 2 platform;</li>\n<li> maintaining the block chain record of all transactions conducted on the platform.\n</li>\n<li>responding to your enquiries;</li>\n<li> providing you with promotional material and information about other goods that we and other organisations that we have affiliations with, offer that may be of interest to you.\n</li>\n<li> facilitating our internal business operations, including the fulfilment of any legal requirements.\n</li>\n<li> analysing our services and customer needs with a view to developing new or improved services.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Except as otherwise permitted by law, we only collect sensitive information about you if you consent to the collection of the information (which you do if you use the social functions of the platform, as explained above) and if the information is reasonably necessary for the performance of our functions, as set out above.\n</p>Failure to provide information<p> If the personal information you provide to us is incomplete or inaccurate, we may be unable to provide you, or someone else you know, with the services you, or they, are seeking.\n</p>Internet users<p> If you access our website, we may collect additional personal information about you in the form of your IP address and domain name.\n</p>\n<p> Our website may contain links to other websites.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy practices of linked websites and linked websites are not subject to our privacy policies and procedures.\n</p>\n<p> Our website uses cookies.\nThe main purpose of cookies is to identify users and to prepare customised web pages for them.\nCookies do not identify you personally, but they may link back to a database record about you.\nWe use cookies to monitor usage of our website and to create a personal record of when you visit our website and what pages you view so that we may serve you more effectively.\n</p>\n<p> All transactions are stored on the block chain that underpins this service.\nThat means that a permanent record of those transactions are maintained as a necessary part of the functioning of the service.\nWhile we employ data minimisation techniques, it is not possible to remove all data as the block chain requires that data to maintain the permanent record of the transactions.\n</p>Children under 15<p> We recognise the special considerations that apply to children\u2019s privacy.\nAny registration for the Earth 2 service \u2013 and related data collection - will be done with the consent of a parent or guardian if the user is identified as being under 15.\n</p>Use and disclosure<p> Generally, we only use or disclose personal information about you for the purposes for which it was collected (as set out above).\nWe may disclose personal information about you to: </p>\n<p> (a) other users of the Earth 2 service as a part of the ordinary functioning of the service, and to facilitate features of, and transactions in, that service, including: </p>\n<ol>\n<li> user name, likeness, avatar, for chat and interaction with us and other users in and through the platform.\n</li>\n<li> user name, real name, financial details and other personal details to enable and related to the sale and purchase of land tiles.\n</li>\n<li> our related entities to facilitate our and their internal business processes.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> (b) third party service providers, who assist us in operating our business, and providing services to you such as: </p>\n<ol>\n<li> third parties who assist with transactions (financial institutions and payment service providers).\n</li>\n<li> third parties who assist us with our business (including information technology service providers), </li>\n</ol>\n<p> and these service providers may not be required to comply with our privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p> (c) our related entities and other organisations with whom we have affiliations so that those organisations may provide you with information about goods and various promotions </p>Disclosure of personal information overseas<p> We are likely to disclose personal information about you overseas.\nFor instance, our related bodies corporate, third party service providers or other recipients may be based overseas or may use infrastructure outside Australia, including the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\n</p>Security<p> We store your personal information in different ways, including in paper and in electronic form.\nThe security of your personal information is important to us.\nWe take all reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is stored safely to protect it from interference, misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, including electronic and physical security measures.\n</p>Access and correction<p> You may seek access the personal information we hold about you, upon making a written request.\nWe will respond to your request within a reasonable period.\nWe may charge you a reasonable fee for processing your request (but not for making the request for access).\n</p>\n<p> We may decline a request for access to personal information in circumstances prescribed by the Privacy Act, and if we do, we will give you a written notice that sets out the reasons for the refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons), including details of the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint.\n</p>\n<p> If, upon receiving access to your personal information or at any other time, you believe the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date, please notify us immediately.\nWe will take reasonable steps to correct the information so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.\nHowever, requests to amend information which is held on the transaction block chain may not be able to be accommodated as the purpose of that block chain is to maintain a permanent record of all in-platform land transactions.\n</p>\n<p> If we refuse to correct your personal information, we will give you a written notice that sets out our reasons for our refusal (unless it would be unreasonable to provide those reasons), including details of the mechanisms available to you to make a complaint.\n</p>",

or ID.\n</p>Part C - Buying and Selling Virtual Land in Earth 2<p> A key aspect of the Earth 2 platform will be the ability for registered users to buy and sell land tiles (<b>Virtual Land</b>).\n</p>\n<p> To be eligible to buy and sell Virtual Land, you must first register as a user of the Website as set out in Part B above.\n</p>\n<p> Each tile of Virtual Land will be a virtual equivalent to a real-world measurement of approximately 10x10m, although they may not all be of exactly identical size.\nThe size and positioning of the Virtual Land is established and controlled by us in our sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p> The first-sale of each tile of Virtual Land will be based on a value that we assign to it in USD.\nFuture sales between registered users will be struck at a price agreed between those users.\n</p>\n<p> All subsequent sales of Virtual Land between registered users must be conducted through the marketplace that we provide on the Website for that purpose (Marketplace).\nWe do not promise that the Marketplace will be always available, or that there will be an uninterrupted connection between the Marketplace and any Payment Account.\n</p>\n<p> Sales of Virtual Land will be conducted in credits on the Website that are equivalent to USD.\nIt is each user\u2019s responsibility to ensure they have sufficient credits to perform any transaction.\nTransactions made using credits are ultimately settled through payments of USD amounts equivalent to the Website credits, between Payment Accounts, credit cards, or any other method that we accept from time to time (for instance, we may in the future expand to accept payment in one or more crypto-currencies).\n</p>\n<p> Each registered user must maintain a valid Payment Account, linked and valid credit card (or other approved method from time to time) through which payments for Website credit-based transactions can be made, and must ensure the details of that account are kept up to date within the Website.\n</p>\n<p> The Website will maintain a register of account balances (credits) for convenience, but the accounts behind the payment methods are operated separately from us and we are not responsible for their operation, balances or accuracy.\n</p>\n<p> If the registered user who holds the rights in any Virtual Land (Seller) wishes to sell that Virtual Land, it can place the land for sale on the Marketplace.\nOther registered users can bid on that Virtual Land, and the successful buyer (as determined by the Seller) will become eligible to take ownership of the Virtual Land (Buyer), subject to paying the agreed price to the Seller for the relevant Virtual Land, and payment to us of the relevant transaction fee (which is listed in the Marketplace) (Transaction Fee).\n</p>\n<p> Without limiting any aspect of Part B of these terms, you must not acquire Virtual Land for the purpose of inciting religious or racial tensions, or engage in any conduct or behavior in connection with Virtual Land that is designed or is likely to incite religious or racial tensions.\nIn addition to other rights we may have under these terms and under applicable law (including the right to cancel your membership without compensation), we may elect to compulsorily acquire Virtual Land from you without notice (for the same price as you first paid for that Virtual Land) if we reasonably consider that you have breached this clause or clause 5 of Part B of these terms.\nPayment of that amount is your sole and exclusive remedy in respect of our election to acquire that Virtual Land and is reasonably designed to protect our legitimate interests in operating Earth 2.\n</p>\n<p> The Buyer must pay the agreed price for the relevant Virtual Land in USD (or other method that we accept from time to time), together with our Transaction Fee.\nOwnership in the Virtual Land will pass on confirmation to our satisfaction of successful and complete payment of the agreed sale price and our Transaction Fee.\nIf payment is not successfully received, then the sale will not proceed.\n</p>\n<p> We will settle any disputes in relation to any ownership of Virtual Land according to the process that we maintain for that purpose from time to time.\n</p>Nature of rights in Virtual Land<p> The value of Virtual Land that is not yet assigned to \u2018ownership\u2019 by any particular user is set by us in our discretion, including by the use of algorithms that respond to various factors including the apparent supply and demand and desirability of particular lots.\n</p>\n<p> There is no inherent value in any Virtual Land and the value in particular blocks of Virtual Land, and in the Virtual Land generally, may fluctuate in value from time to time by various factors including user demand and our algorithmic determination of land values.\n</p>\n<p> Your rights in any Virtual Land are not \u2018ownership\u2019 and are conferred by contract only for the purposes of transacting within the Website as a registered user.\nThose rights are expressly subject to all of the terms that apply to use of the Website, and require you to remain a registered user of the Website.\n</p>\n<p> We reserve the right in the future to convert your holding of Virtual Land (or any equivalent credits held in the Earth 2 platform) to an equivalent value of a crypto-currency that we may create in the future.\nAny conversion would be conducted at a valuation reasonably determined by us.\n</p>\n<p> Rights in Virtual Land are not assignable from your account to any other account (other than by \u2018sale\u2019 as contemplated by these terms).\nIf your membership is cancelled in accordance with these terms, or you cancel your use of the website for any reason, you forfeit any Virtual Land assigned to your account and we are not liable to you in any way (including without limitation for the payment of any amount in respect of the relevant Virtual Land).\nAny Virtual Land so forfeited returns to ownership by us, and will be made available for sale to other users at the price determined by us.\n</p>\n<p> If we have converted Virtual Land holdings to a separate crypto currency (as permitted by these terms), then you will maintain your rights to that crypto currency separately from your registration to the Website, in accordance with the terms that govern that crypto currency.\nThose </p>Tax<p> Transactions involving Virtual Land, between us and any registered user, and between registered users, may be subject to tax.\nA user is responsible for all of the taxation consequences of its use of the Website.\n</p>Fund Transactions<p>To deposit or withdraw funds you must provide us with current, complete and accurate information.\nSuch information may include, without limitation, details such as Your full name, country of origin and e-mail address, copies of identification as well as Your home address, telephone number and Your bank account and/or credit/debit card information (\"Personal Information\").\nThe protection of all of Your Personal Information is regulated by our privacy policy.\nYou agree that You are responsible to update any of Your Personal Information, whenever needed, so that our records are always correct.\nWe reserve the right to terminate Your Earth Version 2 Account and/or to refuse a deposit or a withdrawal if You provide false, incomplete or misleading Personal Information.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that We may refuse, halt or reverse a withdrawal, and/or ask You to verify Your identity as condition to withdrawal if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We are unable to verify or authenticate any or some of the Self-Registered Information You provide.\nor</li>\n<li>You did not provide Us with the full and comprehensive information needed to complete a withdrawal.\nor</li>\n<li>We are obliged by law or regulations to do so.\nor</li>\n<li>It is suspected that the withdrawal may involve fraudulent and/or other unlawful activity.</li>\n</ol>GST(a) Definitions<p> Any terms capitalised in this clause and not already defined above have the same meaning given to those terms in A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).\n</p>(b) GST Exclusive<p> The consideration for a supply of Virtual Land does not include GST.\n</p>(c) Taxable Supply<p> Transactions involving Virtual Land may be a Taxable Supply and subject to GST.\nIf a supply involving Virtual Land is a Taxable Supply, then: </p>\n<ol>\n<li> the Recipient must pay the Supplier the amount equal to the total GST for the supply in addition to the consideration otherwise payable for the supply.\nand </li>\n<li> the Supplier must give the Recipient a Tax Invoice for the Supply.\n</li>\n</ol> (d) Warranty that Tax Invoice is issued regarding a Taxable Supply <p> Where a Tax Invoice is given by the Supplier, the Supplier warrants that the Supply to which the Tax Invoice relates is a Taxable Supply and that it will remit the GST (as stated on the Tax Invoice) to the Australian Taxation Office.\n</p>(e) Later GST change<p> For clarity, the GST payable under subclause (c) is correspondingly increased or decreased by any subsequent adjustment to the amount of GST for the Supply for which the Supplier is liable, however caused.\n</p>(f) Reimbursement or indemnity<p> If either party has the right under
