What information gets processed when our customers connect to our VPN service? <p>We maintain a non-persistent log of connection data for troubleshooting purposes which includes customer\u2019s randomly generated username and internally assigned (non-public) IP address.\nThe troubleshooting log gets securely erased every few hours.\nWe purposely and strictly do not log any other data to mitigate our legal liability.\nWe do not monitor or log your browsing behavior.\nIt is impossible to record your browsing behavior with our technical backend.\nAll the usage data is anonymous and not connected to your real, public IP address.<br>\n<br>\nUpon connection termination we process the amount of traffic you have spent during your VPN session to update the traffic usage counters.\nWe
