other Internet-related services, Booru Project offers its customer (also known as \"Subscribers\") and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information.\nBooru Project respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion and dissemination of information.\nHowever, when there are competing interests at issue, Booru Project reserves the right to take certain preventive or corrective actions.\nIn order to protect these competing interests, Booru Project has developed an </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Acceptable Use Policy (\"AUP\")</strong>, which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer's respective service agreement, and is intended as a guide to the customer's rights and obligations when using Booru Project' services.\nThis AUP will be revised from time to time.\n<br> One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls it.\nThis fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who use it, both in the information they acquire and in the information they disseminate to others.\nWhen subscribers obtain information through the Internet, they must keep in mind that Booru Project cannot monitor, verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information they acquire.\nFor this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet may be sexually explicit or otherwise offensive.\nBecause Booru Project cannot monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, Booru Project cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal Internet communications.\n<br> When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, they must keep in mind that Booru Project does not review, edit, censor or take responsibility for any information its subscribers may create.\nWhen users place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech.\nAlso, because the information created is carried over Booru Project' network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers and non-subscribers of Booru Project, subscribers' postings to the Internet may affect other subscribers and may affect Booru Project' goodwill, business, reputation or operations.\nFor these reasons, subscribers violate Booru Project policy and the Service Agreement when they, their customers, affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following prohibited activities:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Obscene Speech or Materials:</strong>\n<br> Using Booru Project' network to advertise, transmit, store, post, display, or otherwise make available child pornography, Bestiality or obscene speech or material is prohibited.\nBooru Project is required by law to notify law enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through its network.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Defamatory or Abusive Language:</strong>\n<br> Using Booru Project' network as a means to transmit or post negative, defamatory, harassing, abusive or threatening language.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses or Other Destructive Activities</strong>: <br> Distributing information regarding the creation of and sending Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mail bombing or denial of service attacks.\nAlso, activities that disrupt the use of or interfere with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected network, system, service or equipment.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Facilitation a Violation of this AUP:</strong>\n<br> Advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available any software, program, product or service that is designed to violate this AUP, which includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, flooding, mail bombing, denial of service attacks and piracy of software.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Illegal Activities: </strong>\n<br> Engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including, but not limited to, advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards and pirating software.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Activities: </strong>\n<br> Engaging in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that Booru Project determines to be harmful to its subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill or customer relations.\n<br> As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful activities just described rests primarily with the subscriber.\nBooru Project will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its subscribers to ensure that the comply with Booru Project' policy or applicable law.\nHowever, when Booru Project becomes aware of harmful activities, it may take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removal of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by Booru Project.\n<br> Booru Project is also aware that many of its subscribers are themselves providers of Internet services, and that information reaching Booru Project' facilities from those subscribers may have originated from a customer of the subscriber or from another third party.\nBooru Project does not require its subscribers who offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or web sites created by customers of its subscribers.\nBooru Project reserves the right to directly take action against a customer of its subscribers.\nAlso, Booru Project may take action against the Booru Project' subscriber because of activities of a customer of the subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of the subscriber.\nSimilarly, Booru Project anticipates that subscribers who offer Internet services will cooperate with Booru Project in any corrective or preventive action that Booru Project deems necessary.\nFailure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures is a violation of Booru Project policy.\n<br> Booru Project will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required to do so by law, governmental authority or when public safety is at stake.\nBooru Project may, however, monitor its service electronically to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily.\nAlso, Booru Project may disclose information, including, but not limited to, information concerning a subscriber, a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, regulation or governmental request.\nBooru Project assumes not obligation to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been provided and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving such notice.\nFinally, Booru Project may disclose subscriber information or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect Booru Project and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper operation of the system.\nHowever, Booru Project will never sell information to other services or outside companies.\n<br> Booru Project expects that its subscribers who provide Internet services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy of online communications.\nA subscriber's failure to comply with those laws will violate Booru Project policy.\nFinally, Booru Project wishes to emphasize that, in signing the Service Agreement, subscribers indemnify Booru Project for any violation of the Service Agreement, law or Booru Project policy resulting in loss to Booru Project or the bringing of any claim against Booru Project by any third party.\nThis means that, if Booru Project is sued because of a subscriber's or customer of a subscriber's activity, the subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages awarded against Booru Project, plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.<br> We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet users, including Booru Project and its subscribers, as responsible members of the Internet.\nAny complaints about a subscriber's violation of this AUP should be sent to admin@slayerduck.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>* This only applies when the customer has the paid version of our booru software or service</strong>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-11-27
