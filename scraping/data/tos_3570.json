listed persons are excluded from participation.<br>\n<br>\nBy participating in the prize draw, the participant agrees with these Conditions of Participation.\nThe decisions of the organiser in all matters pertaining to this prize draw are final and binding.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Participation</strong>\n<br>\nThe prize draw begins on 01.05.2021 and ends on 31.05.2021 at 23:59 GMT.\nThe following

complies with the guidelines.\nIf it does, it is released by the organizer for publication.\nOnly once it has been published can you participate in the competition.\nThe more reviews you submit, the greater our chance of winning will be.\n<br>\n<br>\nParticipation shall be electronically logged by the organiser.<br>\n<br>\nIn the case of a dispute concerning participation, the legitimate owner of the email address that was used to register shall be regarded as the participant.\nThe \u201clegitimate owner\u201d is the natural person to whom an email address is assigned by an internet service provider, online service provider or other organisation responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address.\nThe potential winners may be requested to

data, in particular their email and postal addresses.\nParticipation with invalid/incomplete data, for example non-functioning or inactive email addresses shall lead to disqualification.<br>\n<br>\nThere is no right to registration for the competition or participation in the prize draw.<br>\n<br>\nIf applicable, the participant may be charged internet access and user costs by the internet service provider when registering and participating in the prize draw.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Execution and settlement</strong>\n<br>\nWithin 10 days of the end of the prize draw,

stated period.<br>\n<br>\nThe organiser shall notify the winner in writing by email or by post.\nThe winner must reply to the notification within the stated period, otherwise their claim on the

colour, model, technical equipment or the like, but will be of comparable value and involve equivalent equipment.\nThe prizes may not be exchanged, are not transferable, cannot be paid in cash and no other prize can be chosen as a replacement.\nMaterial prizes shall be sent free of charge by the organiser or a third party commissioned by the organiser via forwarding agency, parcel service or post

shall contact the winner in order to organise a delivery date.<br>\n<br>\nIf:<br> (a) it is not possible to deliver a prize or notification of the win or<br> (b) the winner refuses the prize, <br>\n<br>\nthis winner shall be disqualified.\nIn this case, the organiser reserves the right to select a new winner by drawing lots.<br>\n<br>\nThe chance of winning a prize depends on the number of draw participants.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Description of prizes</strong>\n<br> One (1) arbitrarily drawn winner will win one (1) voucher valued at \u20ac1,000 or \u20ac100 from Thomann GmbH<br>\n<br>\n<strong>General conditions</strong>\n<br>\nThe organiser reserves the right to end the prize draw at their own discretion at any time without advance notice.\nThis option is of particular use to the organiser in cases where the normal execution of the prize draw cannot be guaranteed due to technical or legal reasons.\nIn this case, the organiser reserves the right to draw the winner of the prize from amongst the eligible participants who had participated prior to the time of termination.<br>\n<br>\nThe organiser also reserves the right, at their own discretion, to exclude persons from participation:<br>\n<br> (a) for manipulation associated with access to or execution of the prize draw;<br> (b) for violations of these Conditions of Participation;<br> (c) for unfair conduct;<br> (d) for incorrect or misleading statements associated with participation in this prize draw.<br>\n<br>\nShould a person attempt to compromise the legitimate operation of the prize draw, e.g.\nusing technical aids, this may present a violation of criminal or civil law.\nShould a person attempt such a thing, the organiser reserves the right to seek damages through legal means and withdraw or demand the return of prizes.\nThe failure to enforce any provision in these official Conditions of Participation shall not constitute the organiser\u2019s waiver of that provision.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Data protection</strong>\n<br>\nThe participant agrees that the organiser shall store all data required for the execution of the prize draw for the duration of the prize draw.\nIn the case of a win, the organiser reserves the right to publish the given names and surnames (shortened to initials) of the winner along with their place of residence on the www.thomann.de website, in the newsletter and/or on social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Google).\nThe participant may object to their data being published after being notified of the win at any time by email to marketing@thomann.de, or by post to the organiser\u2019s address provided in this section.<br>\n<br>\nThe organiser has assigned services necessary for the execution and settlement of the prize draw in part to third parties (cooperation partners).\nParticipants\u2019 data shall be stored by the cooperation partner/s for the purposes of executing and settling the prize draw for the duration of the prize draw.\nAll data shall be deleted after the end and settlement of the prize draw.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>By participating in this prize draw, the participant agrees to the use of their data by third parties for the stated purposes and, in particular, transmission of their data to third parties by the organiser.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe participants may revoke their permission for their data to be used at any time.\nBy revoking this permission, the participant withdraws their participation in the prize draw.\nFurthermore, through the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG), the participant has the guaranteed rights to information and \u2013 provided that the legal requirements for such action have been met (cf.\n\u00a7 35 BDSG) \u2013 correction, blocking or deletion of collected data.<br>\n<br>\nThe stated rights can be exercised by sending a notification via post to: <br>\n<br> Thomann GmbH<br> c/o Data Privacy Officer<br> Hans-Thomann-Stra\u00dfe 1<br> 96138 Burgebrach<br> Germany<br>\n<br>\nThe organiser undertakes to protect the privacy of the participants and ensures that the data shall be used pursuant to the German Federal Data Protection Act, the German Telemedia Act, European Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and EU directive 02/58/EC.\nIn this context, particular reference is made to the organiser\u2019s general data protection provisions.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Liability</strong>\n<br>\nWith the fulfilment or handover of the prize to the participant, the organiser shall be released from all obligations, insofar as the organiser, depending on the nature of the prize draw, has any legal obligation towards the participant.<br>\n<br>\nWarranty claims on winnings that are provided by cooperation partners for the prize draw shall be asserted exclusively against the cooperation partners.<br>\n<br>\nAccording to legal provisions, the organiser shall assume liability in the case of fraudulent intent, wilful intent or gross negligence.\nDamages caused by the organiser as a result of ordinary negligence shall only be compensated if there is breach of a material obligation, the

obtained for practical reasons and the processing of data is permitted by law.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>Legal basis for the processing of personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If we obtain the consent of the data subject to process their personal data, Article 6(1)(a) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing of personal data.</p>\n<p>When processing personal data necessary for the performance

required in order to fulfil or deliver your order or to process an enquiry.\nThe legal basis for this is the fulfilment of the contract concluded with you (e.g.\nfor orders) or the initiation of a contract (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).</p>\n<p>We will also transmit personal data to third parties where we are required to do so by law.\nThe legal basis in this instance is Article 6(1)(c)

the number of visitors, the average time of the visits, pages visited, etc.\nThe data we collect is combined and used for internal purposes only.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>\n<p>We use this combined data for evaluating our products, services and the news we make available via our website, as well as for monitoring use of our website and generally improving its content.</p>\n<p>The temporary storage of IP addresses by the system is required in order to enable the delivery of the website to the user\u2019s computer.\nTo do this, the user\u2019s IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.</p>\n<p>Data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website.\nIn addition, we use the data to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.\nThese purposes are also the basis for our legitimate interests in data processing pursuant to Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>\n<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.\nIf data is stored in log files, this is the case after no more than seven days.\nFurther storage is possible.\nIn this case, the users\u2019 IP addresses are deleted or distorted, so that it is no longer possible to associate them with the calling client.</p>\n<p>The collection of data in order to provide the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website.\nTherefore the user cannot opt out.</p>\n<p>Third party advertisements or links to

enables our website to recognise your computer when you return.\nSessions cookies are erased when you close your browser.</p>\n<p>We use transient cookies to make our websites more user-friendly.\nSome elements on our website require the browser to be identified even after you have moved to a different page.</p>\n<p>Our website also uses <strong>persistent cookies</strong> that enable analysis of the browsing behaviour of our users.\nPersistent cookies are automatically erased after a prescribed period, which may vary depending on the cookie.\nThey enable transmission of, for example, IP addresses and search terms entered, as well as the use of certain website functions.</p>\n<p>Most cookies do not save a user\u2019s personal data.\nHowever, the user\u2019s email address and customer ID could be stored on the server in addition to the cookie ID.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>\n<em>Tracking/web bugs</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some of our services also use \u201ctracking bugs\u201d, \u201cweb bugs\u201d or \u201ctracking pixels\u201d.\nThis involves code snippets that are usually only 1x1 pixel in size and can identify and detect your browser via the browser ID \u2013 your browser\u2019s individual \u201cfingerprint\u201d.\nThese enable the service provider to see how many users have accessed the pixel and if and when an email has been opened or a

additional legal basis for the processing shall be Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.</p>\n<p>The personal data from the input screen is only processed in order for us to process the contact.\nIn the event of contact via email, this is also the basis for the required legitimate interest in the processing of data.</p>\n<p>Any other personal data processed during the sending process serves to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.</p>\n<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection.\nFor the personal data from the contact form input screen and the data sent by email, this is the case if the respective conversation with the user has ended.\nThe conversation is deemed to be ended if it can be inferred from the circumstances that the relevant facts have been conclusively clarified.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>Use of services for marketing and analysis
