(INCLUDING ANY parents, subsidiaries, AFFILIATES, officers, directors, employees, OR agents OF OURS) that arise out of or in any way relate to this SERVICE AND PRODUCTS OR services that we, OUR AFFILIATES AND/OR OUR SERVICE PROVIDER (ON OUR BEHALF) MAY provide to you in connection with YOUR USE OF THIS SERVICE.\nPROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THIS PROVISION PREVENT YOU FROM FILING OR JOINING A COMPLAINT WITH ANY FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT IS AUTHORIZED BY LAW TO SEEK RELIEF AGAINST us ON YOUR BEHALF.\nThe arbitration between you and the AJC will be binding AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED IN THE ARBITRATION MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.</b>\n</p>\n<p>In arbitration, there is no judge and no jury, and review of arbitration decisions in the courts is very limited.\nInstead, disputes will be resolved by an arbitrator, whose authority is governed by the terms of this Agreement.\nYou and the AJC agree that an arbitrator may only award such relief as a court of competent jurisdiction could award, limited to the same extent as a court would limit relief pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.\nAn arbitrator may award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs if a court would be authorized to do so, and may issue injunctive or declaratory relief if that relief is required or authorized by the applicable law, but that injunctive or declaratory relief may not extend beyond you and your dealings with us.\nDiscovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.\nNotwithstanding this arbitration agreement, you and the AJC may bring appropriate claims against each other in small claims court, if the claims fall within the small claims court\u2019s jurisdiction, or any other federal, state, or local government agency authorized by law to hear your claims.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Class Action Waiver:</b> You and the AJC agree that all claims or disputes between you and the AJC and/or its Affiliates will be arbitrated individually, and that there will be no class, representative, or consolidated actions in arbitration.\nIf you or we bring a claim in small claims court, the class action waiver will apply, and neither of the parties can bring a claim on a class or representative basis.\nFurthermore, neither you nor we may participate in a class or representative action as a class member if the class action asserts claims that would fall within the scope of this arbitration agreement if they were directly asserted by you or us.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, this arbitration agreement shall not prohibit you or us from participating in any judgment or settlement in any litigation brought by a federal, state, or local government on behalf of you or us, excluding litigation brought by any relator or party in its capacity as a private attorney general.\nWe both agree that this class action waiver is an essential part of our arbitration agreement and that if this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable by any court or arbitrator then the entire arbitration agreement set forth in this section will not apply to any claim or dispute between you and us.\nThis class action waiver may not be severed from our arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Informal Dispute Resolution:</b> You and the AJC agree to try to resolve disputes informally before resorting to arbitration.\nIf the dispute cannot be resolved by telephone, you agree to notify us of the dispute by sending a written description of your claim to Dawn Forman, Director, Customer Service Operations, 223 Perimeter Center Parkway NE , Atlanta, Ga 30346so that we can attempt to resolve it with you.\nIf we do not satisfactorily resolve your claim within 30 calendar days of receiving written notice of it, then you may pursue the claim in arbitration.\nNeither you nor we may initiate arbitration without first providing the other notice of the claim and following the informal dispute resolution procedure provided in this paragraph.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Procedures:</b> You and the AJC agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act applies.\nAll arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nThe AAA\u2019s rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nIf the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.\nIf the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.\nIf there is a conflict between the AAA\u2019s rules and this dispute resolution agreement, this dispute resolution agreement shall control.\nTo initiate arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claims to Cox Enterprises, Inc., 6205 Peachtree Dunwoody Road, Atlanta, GA 30328 Attn: Legal Department, VP Litigation.\nYou must also comply with the AAA\u2019s rules regarding initiation of arbitration.\nWe will pay all filing fees and costs for commencement of an arbitration, but you will be responsible for your own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or applicable law.\nWe will not seek to recover our fees and costs from you in the arbitration unless your claim has been determined to be frivolous.\nIf you are successful in the arbitration, we will pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\nIf you obtain an award from the arbitrator greater than our last written settlement offer, we will pay you $5,000 in addition to what you have been awarded in the arbitration.\nThe arbitration will be held in a mutually convenient location.\nIf you seek less than $10,000, then you may choose to hold the arbitration in person, via phone, or to have it decided based on written submissions.</p>\n<p>\n<b>USE OF COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide a variety of services on this Service through which you can directly interact with others, such as email services, chat rooms, communications

rights, property or safety of visitors to our Service, our customers, the public our employees, Service Providers and Affiliates.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to deny access to any Communications
