user action (needs to be explicitly send from the user\u2019s mail application) and user may review all the information before sending and decide whether they want to share it with us or not.</p>\n<p>We do not ask for explicit consent as we consider collecting bug report data via email to be a legitimate interest under GDPR.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How it is used by us: </strong>We use

or delete the information: </strong>To delete the data, all records must be first deleted from Sleep as Android and next Google Fit sync action must be executed.\nUser can also manage the data in their Google Account at the Google Account Dashboard.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to opt-out from future personal data collection: </strong>To stop uploading data to Google Fit and using data from the

any data, all retained data are either offline in the app or in Google Fit, subject to Google\u2019s policy.</p>\n<strong>Google Calendar</strong>\n<p>Sleep as Android app may use the integration with Google Calendar, if enabled in the app\u2019s settings, for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exporting sleep data to Google Calendar as standalone events</li>\n<li>reading events in the user\u2019s primary and holiday calendars and using&nbsp.\n<strong>start</strong>, <strong>end</strong> and <strong>title</strong> fields for alarm postponing/advancing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>What is collected:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>user\u2019s primary, sleep and holidays calendars identifiers</li>\n<li>already parsed calendar event identifiers \u2013 in order to remember which events were

policy.</p>\nLocation\n<p>We do not read device location in our apps unless it is absolutely necessary for the core functionalities of our apps.\nWe try to use the most coarse information needed for that purpose and retrieve the data in a battery efficient way.\nIn most of our apps this information never leaves the device by default, unless not specified differently below.</p>\nLocation in Twilight\n<p>The <strong>Twilight</strong> app which needs to timely react on any changes in location with respect to local sunrise and sunset times and adjust screen filtering accordingly.\nFor this the apps need to access location in background.\nTwilight does not collection location and the location information never leaves the device.\nTwilight is basically completely offline and the Internet permission is only used to allow Twilight to talk to smart light devices on the local network.</p>\n<p>Location retrieval can be disabled in the main screen under <em>Sun &amp.\nLocation &gt.\nAutomatic location.</em>\n</p>\nLocation in Air\n<p>The core feature of <strong>Air</strong> is to notify the users\u2019 about worsening in pollutant levels at their current location automatically without touching the app.\nThis can only be done though retrieving location regularly though out the day.\nThe location information is not stored, but only used to quite the pollutant level server for local data.</p>\n<p>Location retrieval cannot be disabled in-app as this would break app\u2019s core functionality.\nBut users may decide to not grant the location permission to the app.</p>\nLocation in Sleep as Android\n<p>Sleep as Android only retrieves location when the app is used.\ntypically when sleep tracking starts.\nIt stores s very coarse geo cell location ~+/-10km at each sleep record to allow users to compare their sleep quality in different locations.\nThe location does not leave the device unless users explicitly install the <em>SleepCloud Backup addon</em> and decide to send those data to their selected services.</p>\n<p>Location gathering and storing at sleep records can be disabled in <em>Settings &gt.\nPrivacy</em>.</p>\n<p>Sleep as Android may query a weather service to show you current weather at your location in the morning.</p>\nDo we disclose any information to outside parties?\n<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties
