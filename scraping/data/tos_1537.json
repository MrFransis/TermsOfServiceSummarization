the ways in which we use your personal information, in particular where (i) you contest the accuracy of your personal information.\n(ii) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your personal information.\n(iii) we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of the processing, but you require the information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal

processing.</strong>If it is applicable under the legislation in your jurisdictions you may require us not to process your personal information for certain specific purposes (including profiling) where such processing is based on legitimate interest.\nIf you object to such processing we will no longer process your personal information for these purposes unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for such processing or such processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.Where your personal information is processed for direct marketing
