determined by the European Commission.</p>\n<p>If we share your personal information with entities located in the United States or other non-EEA jurisdictions which, according to the European

(CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield, and we can no longer rely on our EU-US Privacy Shield Framework certification for&nbsp.\ntransfers of&nbsp.\npersonal information from the European members countries to the US.&nbsp.\nInstead, we rely on other appropriate safeguards recognized by the GDPR to effectuate such transfers set out above.&nbsp.\nWe will continue to apply the Privacy Shield
