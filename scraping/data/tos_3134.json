following personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name;</li>\n<li>Business/company name;</li>\n<li>Email address;</li>\n<li>Phone number;</li>\n<li>Country, region, city and office location;</li>\n<li>Date of

Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data).\nNor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.</p>\n<p>Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with products or services).\nIn this case, we may have to cancel a product or service you have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>\n<p>5.\nHow Do We Use Your Data?</p>\n<p>All personal data is processed and stored securely, for no longer than is necessary in light of the reason(s) for which it was first collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>\n<p>Our use of your personal data will always have a lawful basis, either because it is necessary for our performance of a contract with you, because you have consented to our use of your personal data (e.g.\nby subscribing to emails), or because it is in our legitimate business interests to use it.\nPlease contact us (using the details provided in section 13) if you need details about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.</p>\n<p>Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.\nWe make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.\nWe do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).\nYou can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us (see section 13 below).</p>\n<p>6.\nSpecifically, we may use your data for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing and managing your account;</li>\n<li>Providing and managing your access to our Site;</li>\n<li>Supplying our products and services to you;</li>\n<li>Personalising and tailoring our products and services for you;</li>\n<li>Communicating with you (e.g.\nresponding to emails or calls from you);</li>\n<li>Supplying you with emails that you have opted into (you may unsubscribe or opt-out at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the relevant communication);</li>\n<li>Market research.\nEnforcing our contracts and policies, investigating complaints and preventing illegal activity;</li>\n<li>Complying with our legal obligations;</li>\n<li>Analysing your use of our Site and gathering feedback to enable us to continually improve our Site and your user experience;</li>\n<li>Logging data to allow system auditing.\nSupporting network and system security;</li>\n<li>Conducting web analytics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your data for marketing purposes which may include contacting you by email with information, news and offers on our products and services.\nWe will not, however, send you any unsolicited marketing or spam and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that we fully protect your rights and comply with our obligations under the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.\nWe will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third parties for marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>You have the right to withdraw your consent to us using your personal data at any time, and to request that we delete it.\nWhere you opt out of receiving marketing<br>\nmessages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, product/service experience or other transactions (i.e.\nservice emails).</p>\n<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p>\n<p>If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us (see section 13 below).\nIf we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>\n<p>7.\nHow and Where Do We Store Your Data?</p>\n<p>We only keep your personal data for as long as we need to in order to use it as described above in section 5, and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it.</p>\n<p>Some of the external third parties to whom we transfer your personal data are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>\n<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.\nFor further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</p>\n<p>Where we use certain service providers, we may use standard contractual clauses (\u2018SCCs\u2019) approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.\nFor further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</p>\n<p>Where we use providers based in the US, we will make an assessment to determine whether we can transfer your personal data on the basis of SCCs taking into account the circumstances of the transfer, and put supplementary measures in place if required.\nThe supplementary measures along with SCCs follow a case-by-case analysis of the circumstances surrounding the transfer and this would ensure that U.S.\nlaw does not encroach on the satisfactory level of protection guarantee.\nIf we come to the decision, taking into account the circumstances of the transfer and possible supplementary measures, that appropriate safeguards would not be ensured, then we will either suspend the transfer of your personal data until we ensure an adequate level of protection can be provided or we might end the transfer of your personal data.</p>\n<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>\n<p>Data security is very important to us, and to protect your data we have taken suitable security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.\nFor example, access to our Workbench is enabled by two mechanisms.\nOAuth.\nsalted password mechanism that is encrypted with BCrypt algorithm, and communication between the server and client is secured by HTTPS, using the TLS.Tx protocol.\nAll personal data is encrypted with BCrypt algorithm before being stored (AES 256 encryption for personal data).</p>\n<p>In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.\nThey will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>\n<p>8.\nDo we Share Your Data?</p>\n<p>Subject to the sections below, we will not share any of your data with any third parties for any purposes.</p>\n<p>We may sometimes contract with third parties to supply products and services to you on our behalf.\nThese may include payment processing, search engine facilities, and marketing.\nIn some cases, the third parties may require access to some or all of your data:</p>\n<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.\nWe do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions and the law.</p>\n<p>We may compile statistics about the use of our Site including data on traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information.\nAll such data will be anonymised and will not include any personally identifying data, or any anonymised data that can be combined with other data and used to identify you.\nWe may from time to time share such data with third parties such as prospective investors, affiliates, partners, and advertisers.\nData will only be shared and used within the bounds of the law.</p>\n<p>We may sometimes use third party data processors that are located outside of the EEA.\nWhere we transfer any personal data outside the EEA, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the UK.\nThe third-party data processor used by is Google Cloud Platform.</p>\n<p>In some limited circumstances, we may be legally required to share certain personal data, which might include yours, if we are involved in legal proceedings or complying with legal obligations, a court order, or the instructions of a government authority.</p>\n<p>9.\nWhat happens If Our Business Changes Hand?</p> We may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of our business.<p>\n</p>\n<p>Any personal data that you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of our business that is being transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this privacy policy, be permitted to use that data only for the same purposes for which it was originally collected by us.</p>\n<p>10.\nSubject Access Requests</p> You have the right to ask for a copy of any of your personal data held by us about you.\nPlease contact us for more details using the contact details below in section 13.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (to cover our administrative costs in responding).\nAlternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>\n<p>10.\nCookies</p> Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or device by our Site when you
