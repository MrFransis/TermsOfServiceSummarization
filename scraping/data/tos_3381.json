Disclaimer regarding content TradingView cannot and does not represent or guarantee that any of the information available through our services or on TradingView is accurate, reliable, current, complete or appropriate for your needs.\nVarious information available through our services or on TradingView may be specially obtained by TradingView from professional businesses or organizations, such as exchanges, news providers, market data providers and other content providers (e.g.\nCboe BZX and possibly other established financial exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, New York Mercantile Exchange and Dow Jones), who are believed to be sources of reliable information (collectively, the \"Data Providers\").\nNevertheless, due to various factors \u2014 including the inherent possibility of human and mechanical error \u2014 the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, results obtained from use, and correct sequencing of information available through our services and website are not and cannot be guaranteed by TradingView.\nWe make no warranty and assume no obligation or liability for scripts, indicators, ideas and other content of third parties.\nYour use of any third-party scripts, indicators, ideas and other content is at your sole risk.\n</li>\n<li> Disclaimer regarding investment decisions and trading Decisions to buy, sell, hold or trade in securities, commodities and other investments involve risk and are best made based on the advice of qualified financial professionals.\nAny trading in securities or other investments involves a risk of substantial losses.\nThe practice of \"Day Trading\" involves particularly high risks and can cause you to lose substantial sums of money.\nBefore undertaking any trading program, you should consult a qualified financial professional.\nPlease consider carefully whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition and ability to bear financial risks.\nUnder no circumstances shall we be liable for any loss or damage you or anyone else incurs as a result of any trading or investment activity that you or anyone else engages in based on any information or material you receive through TradingView or our services.\n</li>\n<li> Disclaimer regarding hypothetical performance results Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations, some of which are mentioned below.\nNo representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.\nIn fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program.\nOne of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight.\nIn addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risk in actual trading.\nFor example the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of the trading losses are material points, which can also adversely affect trading results.\nThere are numerous other factors related to the market in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.\n</li>\n<li> Registered users Certain services, such as saving charts, publishing them or the ability to comment on published charts, are available only to registered users of the TradingView website and require you to sign in with a username and password to use them.\nIf you register as a user (a \"Subscriber\") of any of the features of TradingView, during the registration process you may be prompted to click \"Register Now\", \"Submit\" or a similar button.\nyour clicking on such button will further confirm your agreement to be legally bound by these Terms of Use.\nIn consideration of your use of the TradingView website, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract

complete information about yourself as prompted by the TradingView's registration form (the \"Registration Data\") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate,

inaccurate, not current or incomplete, TradingView has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the TradingView services (or any portion thereof).\nYou represent and warrant that you have all intellectual property rights, including all necessary patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights, in and to your content.\nIf you use third-party materials, you represent and warrant that you have the right to distribute third-party material in the content.\nYou agree that you will not submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including patent, privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have

Non-Professional subscriber status As a vendor of official real-time market data from exchanges (e.g.\nNasdaq) for end users, we are required to identify the 'Non-Professional' status of any Subscriber.\nBy ordering a subscription for market data on TradingView (except for the following subscriptions: CME GLOBEX, CBOT, COMEX, NYMEX) you confirm the following: <ol>\n<li> You use market data solely for personal use, not for your business or any other entity.\n</li>\n<li> You are not registered or qualified with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).\n</li>\n<li> You are not registered or qualified with any securities agency, any securities exchange, association or regulatory body in any country.\n</li>\n<li> You do not perform any functions that are similar to those that require an individual to register or qualify with the SEC, the CFTC, any other securities agency, any securities exchange, or association or regulatory body, or any commodities or futures contract market, or association or regulatory body.\n</li>\n<li> You are not engaged as an investment advisor (as that term is defined in Section 202 (a) (11) of the Investment Advisor's Act of 1940) or asset manager and you are not engaged to provide investment advice to any individual or entity.\n</li>\n<li> You are not subscribing to the service in

trading or work as a financial consultant to any person, firm or business entity.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Derived Data Our proprietary derivation consumes raw market data and executes a 2-factor derivation process to produce the displayed price, later consumed by the price engine.\nDerived market data is sourced and supplied from various sources and can therefore be blended.\nThe derivation process involves changing the raw price by a factor determined by the volume of trading on the underlying market, a randomized variable and a maximum offset amount.\nThe derived data price is only ever displayed to our non-professional clients, the derived data price then being the proprietary value of an organization.\nAt no point is raw data accessible by any client, nor can said data be reverse-engineered in any manner.\nAll markets are passed through the same derivation engine.\n</li>\n<li> Access and security You accept responsibility for the confidentiality and use of any username and email address that use to register for your access to and use of our services.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account and are fully responsible for

ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.\nTradingView cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply.\nTradingView considers private information on the site (source code of protected or invite-only scripts, etc.) to be confidential to you.\nTradingView protects such private information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure

the Service, you can cancel the subscription to avoid billing for next months.\n</li>\n<li> We do not offer refunds for upgrades to a more expensive plan or a longer billing cycle.\nRemaining days are converted into an equivalent value of days on the new subscription.\n</li>\n<li> We offer refunds for recurring annual and 2-year payments on demand.\nIf you have been billed for automatic annual and 2-year renewal of the service, you have 14 calendar days (after the payment was made) to contact our support team.\nIf you don't do this, TradingView assumes that renewal of the service is expected and the payment will not be refunded.\n</li>\n<li> Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e.\nafter trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the
