Notice Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement Previews Terms of Use Guidelines for Law Enforcement Transparency Report 2019 Transparency Report 2018 Transparency Report 2017 Privacy Policy Reddit Privacy Policy Effective October 15, 2020.\nLast Revised September 15, 2020 <p>We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc.\n(\u201cReddit,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our sites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the \"Services\") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a separate privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference.</p>\n<strong>What We Collect (and How it is Used and Shared)</strong>\n<br>\n<u>Information You Provide to Us</u>\n<br>We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services.\nThis includes:<em>\n<br>Account information</em>\n<br>If you create a Reddit account, we may require you to provide a username and password.\nYour username is public, and it doesn\u2019t have to be related to your real name.\nYou may also provide other account information, like an email address, bio, or profile picture.\nWe also store your user account preferences and settings.\n<em>\n<br>Content you submit</em>\n<br>We collect the content you submit to the Services.\nThis includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, videos you broadcast via RPAN, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us.\nYour content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.<em>\n<br>Actions you take</em>\n<br>We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services.\nThis includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting.\nIt also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking.\nWe collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.<em>\n<br>Transactional information</em>\n<br>If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Premium or Reddit Coins), we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing.\nReddit uses industry-standard payment processor services (for example, Stripe) to handle payment information.<em>\n<br>Other information</em>\n<br>You may choose to provide other information directly to us.\nFor example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us.<br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br>\n<u>Information We Collect Automatically</u>\n<br>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you.\nThis includes:<em>\n<br>Log and usage data</em>\n<br>We may log information when you access and use the Services.\nThis may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), device settings, pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, and search terms.\nExcept for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.\n<em>\n<br>Information collected from cookies and similar technologies</em>\n<br>We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies.\nWe use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services.\nFor example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings.\nSee our Cookie Notice for more information about how Reddit uses cookies.\nFor more information on how you can disable cookies, please see \u201cYour Choices\u201d below.<em>\n<br>\n</em>\n<p>\n<em>\n<em>Location information</em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<br>We may receive and process information about your location.\nFor example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth).\nWe may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.<br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br>\n<u>Information Collected from Other Sources</u>\n<br>We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you.\nFor example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers (such as the fact that an advertiser is interested in showing you an ad), and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID.\nYou can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in \u201cYour Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics\u201d below.<em>\n<br>Linked services</em>\n<br>If you authorize or link a third-party service (e.g., an unofficial mobile app client) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization.\nLinking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service.\nFor example, if you sign in to Reddit with a third-party identity provider, that provider may share an email address with us.\nTo learn how information is shared with linked services, see \u201cHow Information About You Is Shared\u201d below.\n<em>\n<br>Information collected from integrations</em>\n<br>We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate our Services, including our embeds and advertising technology.\nFor example, when you visit a site that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited.\nSimilarly, if an advertiser incorporates Reddit\u2019s ad technology, Reddit may receive limited information about your activity on the advertiser\u2019s site or app, such as whether you bought something from the advertiser.\nYou can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you as described in \u201cYour Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics\u201d below.<br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br>\n<u>Information Collected by Third Parties</u>\n<em>\n<br>Embedded content</em>\n<br>Reddit displays some linked content in-line on the Reddit services via \u201cembeds.\u201d For example, Reddit posts that link to YouTube or Twitter may load the linked video or tweet within Reddit directly from those services to your device so you don\u2019t have to leave Reddit to see it.\nIn general, Reddit does not control how third-party services collect data when they serve you their content directly via these embeds.\nAs a result, embedded content is not covered by this privacy policy but by the policies of the service from which the content is embedded.\n<em>\n<br>Programmatic ads</em>\n<br>We partner with third-party programmatic ad exchanges to show advertisements relevant to your interests.\nIn providing those ads, those third parties collect information, including log and usage data and information from cookies as described above.\nThese third parties do not receive any information from your Reddit account.<em>\n<br>Audience measurement</em>\n<br>We partner with audience measurement companies (including Quantcast and Nielsen) to learn demographic information about the population that uses Reddit.\nTo provide this demographic information, these companies collect cookie information to recognize your device.<br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br>\n<u>Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers</u>\n<br>If you use Reddit Ads (Reddit\u2019s self-serve ads platform at ads.reddit.com) we collect some additional information.\nTo sign up for Reddit Ads, you must provide your name, email address, and information about your company.\nIf you purchase advertising services, you will need to provide transactional information as described above, and we may also require additional documentation to verify your identity.\nWhen using Reddit Ads, we may record a session replay of your visit for customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research purposes.<br>\n<p>\n<br>We use information about you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Services;</li>\n<li>Research and develop new services;</li>\n<li>Help protect the safety of Reddit and our users, which includes blocking suspected spammers, addressing abuse, and enforcing the Reddit User Agreement and our other policies;</li>\n<li>Send you technical notices, updates, security alerts, invoices, and other support and administrative messages;</li>\n<li>Provide customer service;</li>\n<li>Communicate with you about products, services, offers, promotions, and events, and provide other news and information we think will be of interest to you (for information about how to opt out of these communications, see \u201cYour Choices\u201d below);</li>\n<li>Monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in connection with our Services.\n</li>\n<li>Measure the effectiveness of ads shown on our Services.\nand</li>\n<li>Personalize the Services, and provide and optimize advertisements, content, and features that match user profiles or interests.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account.\nBy using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.</p>\n<p>When you submit content (including a post, comment, chat message, or RPAN broadcast) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content.\nReddit allows other sites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools.\nReddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and other similar technologies.\nAlthough some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderator\u2019s option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services.</p>\n<p>Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public.\nYour profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, awards received, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Premium status, and how long you have been a member of the Services.\nYou can also choose for your profile to include the content you upvote and downvote.</p>\n<p>We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media.\nYour use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature.\nFor more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter).</p>\n<p>Reddit only shares nonpublic information about you in the following ways.\nWe do not sell this information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>With your consent.</em> We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction.</li>\n<li>\n<em>With linked services.</em> If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service.\nYou can control this sharing as described in \"Your Choices\" below.</li>\n<li>\n<em>With our service providers.</em> We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work for us.\nTheir use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\nA few examples: (i) payment processors who process transactions on our behalf, (ii) cloud providers who host our data and our services, (iii) third-party ads measurement providers who help us and advertisers measure the performance of ads shown on our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<em>To comply with the law.</em> We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.\nTo the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request.\nOur Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests.</li>\n<li>\n<em>In an emergency.</em> We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person.</li>\n<li>\n<em>To enforce our policies and rights.</em> We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User Agreement, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others.</li>\n<li>\n<em>With our affiliates.</em> We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Aggregated or de-identified information.</em> We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were, or we may tell an advertiser how many people saw their ad.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong>\n<p>We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\nFor example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted.\nWe also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to nonpublic personal information.</p>\n<p>You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it.\nWe may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.</p>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>\n<p>You have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and sharing of information about you when you use the Services.\nSome of these choices are available to everyone who uses Reddit, while others only apply if you have a Reddit account.</p>\n<br>\n<em>Accessing and Changing Your Information</em>\n<br>You can access and change certain information through the Services.\nSee our Help Center page for more information.\nYou can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here.\n<br>\n<em>Deleting Your Account</em>\n<br>You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page.\nYou can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described in the \u201cYour Rights - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests\u201d section below.\nWhen you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account.\nPlease note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content.\nWe may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.<br>\n<em>Controlling Linked Services\u2019 Access to Your Account</em>\n<br>You can review the services you have permitted to access your account and revoke access to individual services by visiting your account\u2019s Apps page (for third-party app authorizations) and the Connected Accounts section of your Account Settings (for Google Sign-In, Sign in with Apple, and connected Twitter accounts).<br>\n<em>Controlling the Use of Cookies</em>\n<br>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.\nIf you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies.\nPlease note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.\nFor more information on controlling how cookies and similar technologies are used on Reddit, see our Cookie Notice.<br>\n<em>Controlling Advertising and Analytics</em>\n<br>Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt out.\nFor example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics via the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.\nYou can opt out of the Audience Measurement services provided by Nielsen and Quantcast.<br>\n<br>We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements.\nYou can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences in your account settings, or here if you use Reddit in a web browser.\nYou can also use device-level settings to control personalized advertisements on Android (\u201cReset advertising ID\u201d and \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d) and iOS (\u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d) devices.\nYou may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks.\nTo learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the sites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices.<br>\n<em>Do Not Track</em>\n<br>Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the sites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked.\nHowever, there is no accepted standard for how a site should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal.\nInstead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.<br>\n<em>Controlling Promotional Communications</em>\n<br>You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here.\nIf you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.<br>\n<em>Controlling Mobile Notifications</em>\n<br>With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device.\nYou can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.<br>\n<em>Controlling Location Information</em>\n<br>You can control how we use location information inferred from your IP address for content recommendation purposes via the Safety and Privacy settings on your account.\nIf you initially consent to our collection of more precise location information from your device, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.<br>\n<strong>Your Rights</strong>\n<strong>Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests</strong>\n<p>Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account\u2014including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) consumer information requests\u2014can be submitted following the process described here.<br>\n<br>All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your

distinct online communities.<br>\n</strong>\n<strong>This User Agreement and your conduct make that possible.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hello, redditors and people of the Internet! This Reddit User Agreement (\u201c<strong>Terms</strong>\u201d) applies to your access to and use of the websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201d) provided by Reddit, Inc.\n(\u201c<strong>Reddit</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>we</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>us</strong>,\u201d or

you agree to be bound by these Terms.\nIf you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our Services.<br>\n<br>Please take a look at Reddit\u2019s Privacy Policy too\u2014it explains how and why we collect, use, and share information about you when you access or use our Services.</p>\n<strong>1.\nYour Access to the Services</strong>\n<p>Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an Account or otherwise use the Services.\nAdditionally, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have received verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.</p>\n<p>In addition, certain of our Services or portions of our Services require you to be 18 years of age or older, so please read all notices and any Additional Terms carefully when you access the Services.</p>\n<p>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of another legal entity, including a business or government entity, you

Policy Broadcasting Content Policy Moderator Guidelines Cookie Notice Premium and Virtual Goods Agreement Previews Terms of Use Guidelines for Law Enforcement Trademark Use Policy Transparency Report 2019 Transparency Report 2018 Transparency Report 2017 Content Policy Reddit Content Policy <p>Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, the Reddit users.</p>\n<p>Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests, and we encourage you to find\u2014or even create\u2014your home on Reddit.</p>\n<p>While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon.\nCommunities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others.\nLikewise, everyone on Reddit should have an expectation of privacy and safety, so please respect the privacy and safety of others.</p>\n<p>Every community on Reddit is defined by its users.\nSome of these users help manage the community as moderators.\nThe culture of each community is shaped explicitly, by the community rules enforced by moderators, and implicitly, by the upvotes, downvotes, and discussions of its community members.\nPlease abide by the rules of communities in which you participate and do not interfere with those in which you are not a member.</p>\n<p>Below the rules governing each community are the platform-wide rules that apply to everyone on Reddit.\nThese rules are enforced by us, the admins.</p>\n<p>Reddit and its communities are only what we make of them together, and can only exist if we operate by a shared set of rules.\nWe ask that you abide by not just the letter of these rules, but the spirit as well.</p>\n<strong>Rules</strong>\n<strong>Rule 1</strong>\n<p>Remember the human.\nReddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people.\nEveryone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence.\nCommunities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.</p>\n<strong>Rule 2</strong>\n<p>Abide by community rules.\nPost authentic content into communities where you have a personal interest, and do not cheat or engage in content manipulation (including spamming, vote manipulation, ban evasion, or subscriber fraud) or otherwise interfere with or disrupt Reddit communities.</p>\n<strong>Rule 3</strong>\n<p>Respect the privacy of others.\nInstigating harassment, for example by revealing someone\u2019s personal or confidential information, is not allowed.\nNever post or threaten to post intimate or sexually-explicit media of someone without their consent.</p>\n<strong>Rule 4</strong>\n<p>Do not post or encourage the posting of sexual or suggestive content involving minors.</p>\n<strong>Rule 5</strong>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to use your real name to use Reddit, but don\u2019t impersonate an individual or an entity in a misleading or deceptive manner.</p>\n<strong>Rule 6</strong>\n<p>Ensure people have predictable experiences on Reddit by properly labeling content and communities, particularly content that is graphic, sexually-explicit, or offensive.</p>\n<strong>Rule 7</strong>\n<p>Keep it legal, and avoid posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal or prohibited transactions.</p>\n<strong>Rule 8</strong>\n<p>Don\u2019t break the site or do anything that interferes with normal use of Reddit.</p>\n<strong>Enforcement</strong>\n<p>We have a variety of ways of enforcing our rules, including,
