PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING AS A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>1.\nNotice of Claim and Dispute Resolution Period.\nPlease contact Binance first! Binance wants to address your concerns without resorting to formal legal proceedings, if possible.\nIf you have a dispute with Binance, then you should contact Binance and a ticket number will be assigned.\nBinance will attempt to resolve your dispute internally as soon as possible.\nThe parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute (which discussions shall remain confidential and be subject to applicable rules protecting settlement discussions from use as evidence in any legal proceeding).<br>\n<br>In the event the dispute cannot be resolved satisfactorily,

email.\nThe Notice of Claim should be submitted to an email address or hyperlink provided in your correspondence with Binance.\nAfter you have provided the Notice of Claim to Binance, the dispute referenced in the Notice of Claim may be submitted by either Binance or you to arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Section, below.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the submission of a dispute to Binance for resolution internally and the delivery of a Notice of Claim to Binance are prerequisites to commencement of an arbitration proceeding (or any other legal proceeding).\nDuring

paragraph 1 above, any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Binance arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Binance as a user of Binance

by mandatory final and binding individual (not class) arbitration, except as set forth below under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou and Binance further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including without limitation any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Agreement to Arbitrate, or to the

LIMITED.\nThere may be more limited discovery than in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including, if applicable, attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award declaratory or injunctive relief benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration.\nThe arbitration provisions set forth in this Section will survive termination of these Terms.\nArbitration Rules.\nThe arbitration shall be subject to the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules (HKIAC.\nRules) in force when the Notice of Arbitration is submitted, as

reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nJUDGMENT ON ANY ARBITRAL AWARD MAY BE GIVEN IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE PARTY (OR OVER THE ASSETS OF THE PARTY) AGAINST WHOM SUCH AN AWARD IS RENDERED.\nTime for Filing: ANY ARBITRATION AGAINST BINANCE MUST BE COMMENCED BY FILING A REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR, AFTER THE DATE THE PARTY ASSERTING THE CLAIM FIRST KNOWS OR REASONABLY SHOULD KNOW OF THE ACT, OMISSION OR DEFAULT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\nAND THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.\nTHIS ONE YEAR LIMITATION PERIOD IS INCLUSIVE OF THE INTERNAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS SECTION, ABOVE.\nTHERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT TO ANY REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIM NOT ASSERTED WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD.\nIf applicable law prohibits a one-year limitation period for asserting claims, any claim must be asserted within the shortest time period permitted by applicable law.\nProcess.\nNotice: The party who intends to seek arbitration after the expiration of the Dispute Resolution Period set forth in paragraph 1, above, must submit a request to the HKIAC in accordance with the HKIAC Rules.\nIf we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or mailing address you have provided.\nYou agree that any notice sent to this email or mailing address shall be deemed effective for all purposes, including without limitation to determinations of adequacy of service.\nIt is your obligation to ensure that the email address and/or mailing address on file with Binance is up-to-date and accurate.\nSeat of Arbitration: The seat of the arbitration shall be Hong Kong.\nPlace of Hearing: The location of any in-person arbitration hearing shall be Hong Kong, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.\nGoverning Law / Jurisdiction: The governing law of the arbitration shall be Hong Kong.\nConfidentiality.\nThe parties agree that the arbitration shall be kept confidential.\nThe existence of the arbitration, any nonpublic information provided in the arbitration, and any submissions, orders or awards made in the arbitration (together, the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) shall not be disclosed to any non-party except the tribunal, the HKIAC, the parties, their counsel, experts, witnesses, accountants and auditors, insurers and reinsurers, and any other person necessary to the conduct of the arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that disclosure may be required to fulfill a legal duty, protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings.\nThis confidentiality provision shall survive termination of these Terms and of any arbitration brought pursuant to these Terms.</p>\n<p>3.\nClass Action Waiver.\nYou and Binance agree that any claims relating to these Terms or to your relationship with Binance as a user of Binance Services (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) shall be brought against the other party in an arbitration on an individual basis only and not as a plaintiff or class member in a purported class or representative action.\nYou and Binance further agree to waive any right for such claims to be brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, representative, or private attorney general action, to the extent permissible by applicable law.\nCombining or consolidating individual arbitrations into a single arbitration is not permitted without the consent of all parties, including Binance.</p>\n<p>4.\nModifications.\nBinance reserves the right to update, modify, revise, suspend, or make any future changes to Section X regarding the parties\u2019 Agreement to Arbitrate, subject to applicable law.\nYou hereby consent and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that your understanding of this Section is up to date.\nSubject

that if you object to the modifications to Section X, Binance may block access to your account pending closure of your account.\nIn such circumstances, the Terms of Use prior to modification shall remain in full force and effect pending closure of your account.</p>\n<p>5.\nSeverability.\nIf any portion of these Terms are adjudged to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent,
