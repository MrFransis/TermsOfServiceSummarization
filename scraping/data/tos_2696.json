Rights Requests (Subject Access Requests) at Swiftype<p>There are two distinct cases for handling Subject Access Requests: (i) Swiftype as Data Controller and (ii) Swiftype as Data Processor.</p>Swiftype as Data Controller<p>Swiftype is deemed a \u201cdata controller\u201d with regard to personal data that Swiftype has collected directly from the data subject and where Swiftype controls the purpose and means of processing.\nThis applies generally to data that is shared by data subjects interacting directly with Swiftype\u2019s website or services.\nIt does not apply to personal data that is accessed by Swiftype in providing site search, app search or enterprise search to its customers (see Swiftype as Data Processor below).\nFor all requests related to Swiftype\u2019s collection and processing of personal data (when we are the Data Controller), please refer to our Privacy Statement.</p>Swiftype as Data Processor<p>Swiftype is deemed a \u201cdata processor\u201d with regard to personal data that is shared with or made accessible to Swiftype in providing site search, app search or enterprise search to its customers.\nIn these cases, the customer acts as the \u201cdata controller\u201d because it controls the purpose and means (by way of instruction to Swiftype) of processing.\nAs a processor of personal data, we will assist our customers with responding to individual rights requests that they receive under the GDPR.\nIn many cases, customers may be able address these types of requests by logging into the applicable product and using settings available within such product or by using Swiftype APIs.\nSee below for details on handling specific types of requests by using different Swiftype product features.\nWhere this is not possible, you could contact us to request assistance with any such individual rights requests.</p>Handling Requests to Delete Personal Data<p>Swiftype customers control the data they process in the Swiftype services.\nSwiftype employees do not access customer data stored in Swiftype indexes and cannot respond to requests for access or correction for personal data that may be indexed in Swiftype's systems.\nPlease see below for information on Swiftype product features that could be used by Swiftype customers (Data Controllers) to respond to data deletion requests from their users.</p>Site Search Service<p>For granular data deletion, Swiftype provides a set of APIs allowing our customers to delete any data indexed in Swiftype Site Search.\nThe data could be deleted on an engine level, document type level or by individual document.\nAny customer data deleted through APIs is deleted from Swiftype systems irreversibly.\nSee our API documentationfor more details on relevant API methods.</p>\n<p>If you want to close your Site Search account and delete all data from Swiftype systems, you could log in to Swiftype Dashboard, select your Site Search account, go to your settings page and click \u201cClose Account\u201d button to permanently delete your records from Swiftype.</p>App Search Service<p>For granular data deletion, Swiftype provides a set of APIs allowing our customers to delete any data indexed in Swiftype Site Search.\nAdditionally, there is an option of deleting the data using Swiftype App Search Dashboard.\nThe data can be deleted on an engine level or by individual document.\nSee our API documentation for more details on relevant API methods.</p>\n<p>If you want to close your App Search account, please contact Swiftype Support at support@swiftype.com.</p>Enterprise Search Service<p>On a granular level, if you need to delete a document from Swiftype Enterprise Search, you can delete it from your data source (Google Drive, Confluence, etc) and Swiftype would automatically pick up the changes and remove your documents from our data stores.\nYou can also use your Account Settings dashboard to delete your data sources, and Swiftype would delete all related documents and secrets from our systems.</p>\n<p>To close an individual Enterprise Search account and all private data sources,log in to your organization, open your Account Settings and click \"Delete\" to delete your account and data from Swiftype.\nTo delete a whole organization account, please contact Swiftype Support at support@swiftype.com.</p>Handling Requests to Access or Correct Personal Data<p>Swiftype customers control the data they process in the Swiftype services.\nSwiftype employees do not access customer data stored in Swiftype indexes and cannot respond to requests for access or correction for personal data that may be indexed in Swiftype's systems.\nPlease see below for information on Swiftype product features that could be used by Swiftype customers (Data Controllers) to respond to data access or correction requests from their users.</p>Site Search Service<p>If you need to access or update any data indexed in Swiftype Site Search, you can use our APIs to do so.\nSee our API documentation for more details.\nFor crawler-based engines, you can update the content on your website, and our crawlers would pick up the changes.</p>App Search Service<p>If you need to access or update any data indexed in Swiftype App Search product, you can use our APIs or the Dashboard to do so.\nSee our API documentation for more details on relevant API methods.</p>Enterprise Search Service<p>Enterprise search connections keep the data in Swiftype systems in sync with the data sources defined by our customers.\nThis means, that any updates to the original data would be reflected in Swiftype Enterprise Search databases.</p>", "created_at": "2021-02-03 21:10:14.926275", "updated_at": "2021-02-03 21:10:18.953031"}, {"id":
