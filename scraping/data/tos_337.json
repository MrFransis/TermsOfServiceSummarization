pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment.\nYou agree that the remedies Mobiblocks may pursue in order to effect payment shall include, but not be limited to, immediate cancellation without notice to you of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf.\nMobiblocks reserves the right to charge you reasonable \u201cadministrative fees\u201d or

from the credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed Payment Method(s) linked to your PayPal Account (\u201cPayPal Funding Source\u201d).\nIt is your responsibility to keep your PayPal Account and PayPal Funding Source current and funded, and your PayPal Account backed by a valid credit card.\nYou acknowledge and agree that <strong>(I)</strong> PayPal reserves the right to decline a

available/sufficient funds) and <strong>(II)</strong> in such event, neither PayPal nor Mobiblocks shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.\nIf for any reason PayPal is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for your purchase, you agree that PayPal and Mobiblocks may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment.\nYou agree that if the transaction is
