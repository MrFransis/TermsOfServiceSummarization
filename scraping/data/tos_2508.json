below toward copyright infringement.\nWe reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.\nRemember that your use of Bot Lab\u2019s Services is at all times subject to the&nbsp;Terms of Use, which incorporates this Copyright Dispute Policy.\nAny terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the&nbsp;Terms of Use.</p> 1.Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements.\n<p>If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Bot Lab\u2019s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our \u201cDesignated Agent,\u201d whose contact details are listed below):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;</li>\n<li>(b) Identification of works or materials being infringed;</li>\n<li>(c) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence;</li>\n<li>(d) Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;</li>\n<li>(e)A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c)is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li>(f) A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.</li>\n</ul> 2.Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent.\n<p>Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) remove or disable access to the infringing material;</li>\n<li>(b) notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material.\nand</li>\n<li>(c) terminate such content provider\u2019s access to the Services if he or she is a repeat offender.</li>\n</ul> 3.Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent.\n<p>If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner\u2019s agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;</li>\n<li>(b) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;</li>\n<li>(c) A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material.\nand</li>\n<li>(d) Content provider\u2019s name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider\u2019s address is located, or, if the content provider\u2019s address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days.\nUnless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Company\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p>Please contact Company\u2019s

concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the Bot Labs Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services.\nThe Bot Labs Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services.\nTHE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY BOT LABS (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN \u201cAS-IS\u201d BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Limitation of Liability</em>.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE BOT LABS PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO BOT LABS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Indemnity</em>.\nYou agree to indemnify and hold the Bot Labs Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Assignment</em>.\nYou may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Bot Labs\u2019 prior written consent.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Choice of Law</em>.\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Agreement.\n</em>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Bot Labs and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Bot Labs.\nBoth you and Bot Labs acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Bot Labs\u2019 officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement</em>.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cRules\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p> (b) <em>Costs of Arbitration</em>.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nBot Labs will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nBot Labs will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\n</p>\n<p> (c) <em>Small Claims Court.\nInfringement</em>.\nEither you or Bot Labs may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n<p> (d) <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>.\nYOU AND BOT LABS WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Bot Labs are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Bot Labs over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND BOT LABS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n</p>\n<p> (e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Bot Labs is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> (f) <em>Opt-out</em>.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 2105 S Bascom Ave, Ste 380, Campbell, CA 95008 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.\n</p>\n<p> (g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Bot Labs to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Bot Labs agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.\n</p>\n<p> (h) <em>Severability</em>.\nIf the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Bot Labs.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Miscellaneous</em>.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Bot Labs may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Bot Labs agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Bot Labs, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Bot Labs, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Bot Labs in any respect whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p> Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and Bot Labs agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.\n</p> ", "created_at":
