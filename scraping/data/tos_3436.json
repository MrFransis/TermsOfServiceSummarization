types of personal information we may collect and how we may use it.</p>\n<p>What personal information we collect<br>\n\u2022 When you create an account, register your products, apply for commercial credit, purchase a product, download a software update, contact us or participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number,

may ask for your Social Security number (SSN) but only in limited circumstances such as when setting up an account.</p>\n<p>How we use your personal information<br>\n\u2022 The personal information we

your preferences.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We also use personal information to help us create, develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention and anti-fraud purposes.</p>\n<p>\u2022 From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and

purposes such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve our products, services, and customer communications.</p>\n<p>\u2022 If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</p>\n<p>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information<br>\nWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual.\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>\n<p>\u2022 We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where a product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</p>\n<p>\u2022 We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, and store and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>\nCookies and Other Technologies<br>\nOur website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use \u201ccookies\u201d and other technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons.\nThese technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\nWe treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\nSimilarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\n<p>We and our partners may use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.\nIf you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your Apple device: http://oo.apple.com or Android device using: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en.\nIf you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests.\nYou may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information.</p>\n<p>We and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications.\nOur goal in these cases is to make your experience with us more convenient and personal.\nFor example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the store.\nKnowing your country and language helps us provide a customized and more useful shopping experience.\nKnowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.</p>\n<p>If you want to disable cookies and you\u2019re using a computer web browser, go to preferences and then disable

behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nWe may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.</p>\n<p>In some of our email messages, we use a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d linked to content on our website.\nWhen customers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our website.\nWe track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.\nIf you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.</p>\n<p>Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been opened.\nWe may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to customers.</p>\n<p>Disclosure to Third Parties<br>\nAt times we may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with us to provide products and services, or that help us market to customers.\nPersonal information will only be shared by us to provide or improve our products, services and advertising.\nit will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Service Providers<br>\nWe share personal information with companies who provide services such as information processing, extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys.\nThese companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever we operate.</p>\n<p>Others<br>\nIt may be necessary \u2212 by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence \u2212 for us to disclose your personal information.\nWe may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users.\nAdditionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.</p>\n<p>Protection of Personal Information<br>\nWe take the security of your personal information very seriously.\nOur online services such as the store protect your personal information during transit using encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nWhen your personal data is stored by us, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures.</p>\n<p>When you use some of our products, services, or applications or post on our forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them.\nYou are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances.\nFor example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public.\nPlease take care when using these features.</p>\n<p>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information<br>\nWe make it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date.\nWe will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>Access to Personal Information<br>\nYou can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account.\nFor other personal information we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose including to request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if we are not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes.\nWe may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law.\nAccess, correction, or deletion requests can be made through the regional Privacy Contact Form.</p>\n<p>Location-Based Services<br>\nTo provide location-based services on our products, we and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or

services.\nFor example, we may share geographic location with application providers when you opt in to their location services.</p>\n<p>Some location-based services offered by us, may require your personal information for the feature to work.</p>\n<p>Third-Party Sites and Services<br>\nOur websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and
