by reputable sources and/or context examples.\nYou are also asked to read the detailed instructions about creating new entries, which you will find by clicking the&nbsp.\nNotes for Users.</p>\n<p>The New Entry forum is intended for individual suggestions only.\nIf you would like to submit a whole list of words, the procedure to be followed is explained in the next section.</p>\n<b>Donating word lists</b>\n<p>If you wish to give us a more extensive collection of words, we will naturally be very happy to hear from you.\nPlease write a brief e-mail to the LEO team so that we can coordinate the procedure.\nWe can only integrate word lists for which you hold the copyright.\nBy submitting the word list, you declare your agreement to transfer your collection of vocabulary items to LEO and permit LEO to make use of the data worldwide as required either directly or through third parties (online and offline).\nIn particular, you agree that LEO may replicate and distribute it in all possible forms (in print, on data carriers or in other media) and may make it available for public access by third parties.</p>\n<b>Reporting mistakes</b>\n<p>To correct simple spelling mistakes, typos etc., please make use of the Report a mistake&nbsp;form.</p>\n<p>If you have doubts about the quality or accuracy of entries in the dictionary and would like to read the opinions of other users, check whether there has already been a discussion on this topic in the forum and, if not, launch a new discussion in the &nbsp;\u2018Wrong entry?\u2019&nbsp;forum.\n(Please also read the&nbsp;Forums&nbsp;section below.)</p>Forums <b>Content and use of the forums</b>\n<p>The forums (links:&nbsp;German-English, German-French, German-Spanish, German-Italian, German-Chinese, German-Russian, German-Portuguese, German-Polish) are intended to give you the opportunity to ask questions, provide information, make comments and to publish your views on other matters related to the subject of languages and to discuss these with other users.\nParticipation in the forums is subject to the following<strong> conditions of use:</strong>\n</p>Registration<p>\n<strong>Participation in the forums must be preceded by </strong> Registration, for which a <strong>valid email address must be provided</strong>.\nYou may, of course, participate in discussions under a pseudonym (nick/alias).\nAccordingly, registration requires you to choose a login identity as well as a nick/alias.\nIn principle, you can select the same sequence of characters for your nick as for your login.\nHowever, for security reasons you are advised to choose a different sequence of characters for your login to avoid giving third parties an easy way of hacking into your account.\n<strong>You are not permitted to take part in the forums using a number of different nicks and thus to appear in seemingly different identities.</strong>\n</p>Forum policy<p>Every user who posts a contribution in our forums agrees irrevocably to the publication of this contribution in the forum concerned.\nHowever, the user has no entitlement to force LEO to publish their contributions in a forum.</p>\n<p>Contributions must be pertinent, in other words, they must refer to the subject of language.\nLEO is entitled to erase contributions that are not related to the subject of language.\nThe different sections (sub-forums) are arranged into various topics.\n<strong>Before you use a section for the first time, you are asked to read the notes provided about that section</strong> (info link just to the right of the section title).\nThis explains the features of this section and gives instructions about how to start a new thread (discussion).\nBefore initiating a new discussion, you should in any case check whether a corresponding discussion has already been launched on the topic in question by using the&nbsp;forum search.\nIf this is not the case, go to the forum start page (Forum home) and click on the heading of the appropriate section.\nYou can then click the \u201cStart new thread\u201d button to start a new discussion.</p>\n<p>Discussions in the forums should be conducted in a courteous and objective manner.\nSubstantive criticism, even if it is quite forceful, is of course permitted.\nHowever, defamatory criticism and disparaging personal comments or other remarks that contravene applicable German law are not permitted.\n<strong>Insofar as LEO is aware of forum contributions that contravene German law, LEO reserves the right to inform the public prosecutor accordingly.&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If any content in a forum appears to a user to be illegal or dubious, we ask the user to inform us immediately and send an e-mail to the LEO teamIf any content in a forum appears to a user to be illegal or questionable, we ask the user to inform us immediately by sending an email to the LEO team.\nPlease indicate the reason(s) that the contribution is considered to be illegal or at least questionable, so that we can investigate the matter.\nPlease also send us the URL (address of the contribution in question, shown in the browser's address bar), to enable us to locate the contribution.</p>\n<strong>Sanctions</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Completion of the registration process establishes a contractual relationship between LEO and the registered user</strong>.\nLEO is entitled to <strong>ban any user or to terminate this contract immediately</strong> if the user violates the above terms of use or behaves in such an unacceptable manner that LEO cannot reasonably continue the contract.\nIn addition, LEO can also remove any individual contributions which are in contravention of the terms of use set out above.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In the event of a termination or the blocking of a contract, the user concerned is not permitted to register again with LEO</strong> using the same or another login and/or nick <strong>without obtaining prior written consent from LEO</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>LEO is entitled, but not obliged, to continue to make use of the contributions posted in a forum by the user in question prior to termination of the contract.\nContributions that have been erased may not be re-posted.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Online Courses / General Terms &amp.\nConditions&nbsp;<p>If you would like to
