activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this list or define what we consider abuse.\nCheck the Acceptable Use Policy for more details about the Prohibited Activities.</p> BANDWIDTH USAGE <p>Bandwidth transfer is subject to fair usage policy.\nExcessive/abusive bandwidth consumption that may result in service disruption is not acceptable.\n</p> SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate the privileges of users who commit violations of our policies and service agreements.\nWe will determine, in our discretion, whether there has been a breach of these terms through your use of our Site or VPN Service and suspend or terminate a user's account accordingly.\n</p> ANTI-FRAUD <p>We take precautionary steps to prevent fraudulent sign-ups, by relying on automated checks or by doing manual checks.\nWe will never ask for proof of identity, such as a scanned copy of a Government issued ID.\nInstead, we would rather decline an order which we believe to be suspicious.\n</p> LOGGING <ul>\n<li>We do not log any user activity, such as but not limited to sites you visit, DNS lookups, email messages, passwords, etc.\n</li>\n<li>We only log access to our VPN Service for troubleshooting, service improvement and security purposes.\n</li>\n<li>We log customer's IP address, VPN session connect and disconnect time, amount of traffic transferred.\nAll these session logs are removed shortly after closing the session.\n</li>\n<li>We do not give your personal info to any third parties.\nWe do not cooperate

is due, you will be notified by e-mail.\nThe refund process can take up to 15 days (usually less than a day) after cancellation of your account to receive your refund depending on payment form used.\nIf you have not received your refund after 15 days, please inform us.\n<br> We do not refund orders from users suspended for breaching our policies.\n<br> No refunds (full or partial) are provided after the 7 days since last payment for any reasons.\n<br> No refunds are provided for the reason of potentially changing a discount/voucher code.\n<br> Refund requests must be based on valid reasons.\nWe do not refund orders for vague reasons like \"it doesn't work\" without providing us details and letting us help.\nFor example, if the customer doesn't use the correct VPN account credentials, first we need to make sure that the credentials are correct.\n<br> Issuing a 2nd refund for any reason is not possible.\n<br> Bitcoin refunds are made in Bitcoin, not the USD/EUR/GBP/other currency equivalent.\nFor example, if you paid 0.005 BTC and you ask for a refund after a few days, you will receive 0.005 BTC back.\nThe obvious reason for doing so is to protect both you and us from BTC's massive volatility, as well as discouraging speculative signups &amp.\nrefund requests.\n<br> Not all payment instruments can be refunded! If you pay using a payment method that can't be refunded, we will only be able to refund using PayPal, Bitcoin.\n<br>\n</p>OUR LIABILITY We do our best to keep the VPN Service up and running,
