below.</p>\n<strong>1.\nAbout This Policy</strong>\n<p>This Policy sets out the essential details relating to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal data you use the website, Publisher

activities for the following types of data subjects:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishers (\u201c<strong>Publishers</strong>\u201d) who use our publisher-facing product (the \u201c<strong>Publisher Platform</strong>\u201d) that helps publishers of podcasts monetize their podcasts by inserting ads into the podcasts hosted by Megaphone.\nPublishers also have the option to utilize the Spotify Audience Network (\u201c<strong>SPAN\u201d</strong>) as part of our service offerings.</li>\n<li>Advertisers (\u201c<strong>Advertisers</strong>\u201d) who use our advertiser-facing services (the \u201c<strong>Advertiser Services</strong>\u201d) to help reach targeted audiences, which includes the SPAN and dsp.megaphone.fm (\u201c<strong>Advertiser Dashboard</strong>\u201d).</li>\n<li>Listeners (\u201c<strong>Listeners</strong>\u201d) of podcasts hosted by Megaphone, whether they are listening on Spotify or other third party audio streaming services.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With respect to personal data about Publishers and Advertisers, Spotify is the data controller.\nWith respect to&nbsp.\npersonal data about Listeners, if Spotify is processing the data as part of providing SPAN services, Spotify is the controller.\nIn all other contexts with respect to Listeners, Spotify is the processor.</p>\n<p>From time to time, we may develop new or offer additional services.\nIf the introduction of these new or additional services results in any change to the way we collect or process your personal data we will provide you with more information and additional terms or policies.\nUnless stated otherwise when we introduce these new or additional services, they will be subject to this Policy.</p>\n<strong>2.\nYour Rights and Preferences</strong>\n<p>As provided by applicable privacy laws, you may have certain rights as individuals in relation to their personal data.\nAs available and except as limited under applicable

notice that you wished to withdraw consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right not to be subject to Automated Decision-making</strong> - the right to not be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making, including profiling, where the decision would have a legal effect on you or produce a similarly significant effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights).\u201d We may decline requests to exercise these rights where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates.</p>\n<p>In addition to the rights above, you always have the following choices regarding promotional communications and notifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promotional Communications - If you are a Publisher or Advertiser who have opted into receiving newsletters from us (which may include updates about new or improved

promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not sell Listener personal data and have taken substantial steps to identify and remediate any data sharing arrangements that could constitute a \"sale\" under the CCPA following our acquisition by Spotify.\nWe will continue to update our business practices as regulatory guidance becomes available and provides clarity on what constitutes a sale transaction, particularly in the advertising ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you are a Listener, depending on the service on which you listen to podcasts (e.g., Spotify or another service), that service\u2019s privacy policies may apply to you in addition to this Policy, which may contain additional disclosures and rights.\nIf you are a Listener and listen to podcasts on Spotify, Spotify\u2019s user privacy policy can be found here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about your

our daily business operations and to enable us to maintain and provide services to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Service Providers.\n</strong>We may share your information with our agents and service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as to host our Services, manage databases, facilitate payment or send communications for us.\nWe have direct relationships with certain advertising, marketing and analytics services (including some of our measurement partners) who also are our service providers that help us collect and analyze personal data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>In connection with a transfer of assets.</strong> If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer your personal data to one or more third parties as part of that transaction;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To comply with legal requirements.</strong> We will share your personal data when we in good faith believe it is necessary for us to do so in order to comply with a legal obligation under applicable law, or respond to a valid legal process, such as a search warrant, a court order, or a subpoena.\nWe also will also share your personal data where we in good faith believe that it is necessary for the purpose of our own, or a third party\u2019s legitimate interest relating to national security, law enforcement, litigation, criminal investigation, protecting the safety of any person, or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm, provided that we deem that such interest is not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms requiring the protection of your personal data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Other parties with your consent.</strong> We may share information about you with third parties when you consent to such sharing.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>6.\nCookies</strong>\n<p>When you use the Publisher Platform or Advertiser Services, we or our third party partners may store some information on your device or device hard drive as a \"cookie\" or similar type of file (such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, and similar technologies that work on mobile devices) to collect data related to usage of these services and for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with the Website.</p>\n<p>We use the following types of cookies on the Publisher Platform and Advertiser Dashboard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strictly necessary cookies.\nThese are cookies that are required for the operation of our website.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Analytical/performance cookies.\nThey allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it (such as Google Analytics).</li>\n<li>Functionality cookies.\nThese are used to recognize you when you return to our website (such as cookies dropped by Intercom).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We currently do not directly collect personal data about Listeners through cookies.\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>7.\nOpt-Outs</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting out of cookies.</strong> If you want to stop or restrict the placement of cookies or flush any cookies that may already be on your computer or device, please refer to and adjust your web browser preferences.\nFurther information on cookies is available at www.allaboutcookies.org.\nBy deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain areas or features of our service or some of its functionality may be affected.\nCookies and similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personal data from your device without your knowledge.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting out of targeted advertising via

please use Nielsen\u2019s opt-out function.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that Nielsen\u2019s opt-out function does not opt you out of tailored advertising entirely - it works independently and is unique to each browser on your devices and each IP address that you use to access podcasts.\nFor instance, if you opt out of tailored advertising on your iPad at home but not on your iPhone at home, you may still receive tailored advertising while listening to podcasts on your iPhone.\nRelatedly, if you opt out on your iPad at home but then listen to podcasts from a different location, you may still receive tailored ads.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once you opt out, Nielsen will stop providing us with your data.\nIt can take up to 30 days for our database to update your selection, during which you may still receive tailored advertising.<br>\n</p>\n<strong>8.Links to Third Party Sites and Services</strong>\n<p>Our website may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and

organisational measures to help protect the security of personal data.\nhowever, please note that no system is ever completely secure.\nWe have implemented various policies including pseudonymisation, encryption, access, and retention policies to guard against unauthorised access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems.</p>\n<p>If you are a Publisher or Advertiser and have an account with us, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any access to or use of your account using your password, whether or not authorized by you.\n&nbsp;Please notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security.<br>\n</p>\n<strong>10.\nData Retention and Deletion</strong>\n<p>We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the service you are using and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the performance of our services, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information required to send these communications until you opt out of receiving these communications in accordance with our policies.<br>\n</p>\n<strong>11.\nInternational Transfers</strong>\n<p>Spotify USA, Inc.\nis based in the United States and we process and store personal data in the United States and other
