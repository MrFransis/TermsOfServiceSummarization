of your information.\nThis policy specifically explains how we, our partners, and users of our services deploy cookies, as well as the options you have to control them.\n</p>\nWhat are cookies?\n<p>Cookies are small pieces of data, stored in text files, that are stored on your computer or other device when websites are loaded in a browser.\nThey are widely used to \u201cremember\u201d you and your preferences, either for a single visit (through a \u201csession cookie\u201d) or for multiple repeat visits (using a \u201cpersistent cookie\u201d).\nThey ensure a consistent and efficient experience for visitors, and perform essential functions such as allowing users to register and remain logged in.\nCookies may be set by the site that you are visiting (known as \u201cfirst party cookies\u201d), or by third parties, such as those who serve content or provide advertising or analytics services on the website (\u201cthird party cookies\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking technologies such as \u201cweb beacons\u201d or \u201cpixels.\u201d These are typically small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar purposes as cookies.\nThey are often used in conjunction with cookies, though they are not stored on your computer in the same way.\nAs a result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their functionality will be restricted.\n</p>\n<b>How we use cookies</b>\n<p>We use cookies for a number of different purposes.\nSome cookies are necessary for technical reasons.\nsome enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users.\nand some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks.\nSome of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d button on a post, for example).</p>\n<p>Many of the cookies we use are only set if you are a registered WordPress.com user (so you don\u2019t have to log in every time, for example), while others are set whenever you visit one of our websites, irrespective of whether you have an account.</p>\n<p>For more information on the choices you have about the cookies we use, please see the Controlling Cookies section below.\n</p>\n<b>Where we place cookies</b>\n<p>We set cookies in a number of different locations across our services.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On our websites (including automattic.com, wordpress.com, vip.wordpress.com, jetpack.com, woocommerce.com, crowdsignal.com, gravatar.com, intensedebate.com, vaultpress.com, akismet.com, simplenote.com, simperium.com, leandomainsearch.com, cloudup.com, longreads.com, and happy.tools).</li>\n<li>In the administrative dashboards of our websites, such as Calypso and wp-admin.</li>\n<li>On sites we host for our users.</li>\n<li>On sites that use our plugins (e.g.\nJetpack).</li>\n<li>In the emails we send.</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Types of Cookie</b>\n<p>The table below explains the types of cookies we use on our websites and why we use them.\n</p>\n<b>Category of cookies</b>\n<b>Why we use these cookies</b> Required\nThese cookies are essential for our websites and services to perform basic functions and are necessary for us to operate certain features.\nThese include those required to allow registered users to authenticate and perform account-related functions, store preferences set by users such as account name, language, and location, and ensure our services are operating properly.\nAnalytics and Performance\nThese cookies allow us to optimize performance by collecting information on how users interact with our websites, including which pages are visited most, as well as other analytical data.\nWe use these details to improve how our websites function and to understand how users interact with them.\nAdvertising\nThese cookies are set by us and our advertising partners to provide you with relevant content and to understand that content\u2019s effectiveness.\nThey may be used to collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites to predict your preferences and to display more relevant advertisements to you.\nThese cookies also allow a profile to be built about you and your interests and enable personalized ads to be shown to you based on your profile.\nUser Sites\n<p>In addition to the cookies set on our own sites, we utilize cookies for our Site Stats feature.\nThis tallies the unique numbers of visitors to a site, as well as the number from specific geographic locations.\nA visitor is counted when we see a user or browser for the first time in a given period.</p>\nExamples\n<p>Below are examples of the cookies set by Automattic, with explanations of their purpose.\nSome of these cookies are set across our whole network, whereas some are specific to individual services (e.g.\nWordPress.com, Longreads, etc).\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list, but rather aims to be representative.\nInformation about cookies that may be set by third parties, such as our ads partners, is below.&nbsp;Additionally, we occasionally set referrer cookies on Jetpack connected sites, using WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>In addition, people and companies that use our services to publish or host their own sites may place additional cookies.\nWe provide more information on these cookies below.</p>\n<b>Required</b>\n<b>Cookie</b>\n<b>Purpose</b> __ssid\nFor processing payment and to aid in fraud

or sites that use our services.</p>\nAdvertisements from Third Parties Through Automattic\u2019s Ads Program\n<p>Our mission is to democratize publishing.\nSo that we can offer free access to create a website using WordPress.com, we show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites.\nOur users may also choose to place ads on their site through our ads program.\nAdditionally, we also show ads from our ads program on some of our own websites (e.g.\nlongreads.com), and in emails.</p>\n<p>We operate our ads program in partnership with third party vendors.\nAs part of the operation of our ads program, we use cookies to collect certain information.\nAdvertising cookies enable us and our partners to serve ads and to personalize those ads based on information like visits to our sites and other sites on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Below is a representative list of our advertising program partners, along with information on the cookies that that each partner sets.&nbsp;The partners we work with change from

our users may set additional cookies (such as Google Analytics), depending on the features they have chosen to enable or the plugins they have installed.</p>\nControlling Cookies\n<p>Visitors may wish to restrict the use of cookies or completely prevent them from being set.\nMost browsers provide for ways to control cookie behavior such as the length of time they are stored \u2013 either through built-in functionality or by utilizing third party plugins.\nIf you disable cookies, please be aware that some of the features of our service may not function correctly.</p>\n<p>To find out more on how to manage and delete cookies, visit aboutcookies.org.\nFor more details on your choices regarding use of your web browsing activity for interest-based advertising you may visit the following sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>networkadvertising.org</li>\n<li>optout.aboutads.info&nbsp;</li>\n<li>youradchoices.com</li>\n<li>youronlinechoices.eu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On a mobile device, you may also be to adjust your settings to limit tracking.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some analytics services we use, which place their own cookies or web tags on your browser, offer their own opt out choices.\nFor example, you can opt out of Google Analytics by installing Google\u2019s opt-out browser add-on, from Hotjar by using the Do Not Track header, and from Nielsen by clicking the opt out link found within Nielsen\u2019s Privacy Statement.</p>\nOur Internal Analytics Tool\n<p>In order to better understand how our services are used, we monitor certain user activities that take place within our products, including page views and clicks on any links used when managing a site via our dashboards.\n</p>\n<p>We call each one of these actions an \u201cevent.\u201d Analytics events are attached to your WordPress.com account and are handled via a first party system that Automattic owns and maintains.\nIn general, we record the following data for each event: IP address, WordPress.com user ID and username, WordPress.com-connected site ID (for sites not hosted on WordPress.com), user agent, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, and country code.</p>\n<p>We use this information to improve our products, make our marketing to you more relevant, personalize your experience, and for the other purposes described in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>You may opt out of our analytics program through your user settings.\nBy doing so, you won\u2019t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nNote that opting out does not disable the functionality of the actions we track \u2013 for example, if you publish a post, we will still have record of that (don\u2019t worry!), but for an event or action after you opt out, we will not have other data associated with that action or event in the analytics tool.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For our Simplenote Users:</strong>\n</em> We use our first party analytics tool in Simplenote to help us better understand how Simplenote is used and improve the app for our users.\nYou may opt-out through your privacy settings in the app.\nBy doing so, you won\u2019t share information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out.\nOne more thing\u2013For Simplenote users who log onto Simplenote using their WordPress.com login, if you\u2019d like to opt-out of our analytics tool on Simplenote, you\u2019ll also need to opt out on the Simplenote app\u2013not on your WP.COM Account Privacy Settings.</p>\nConsent for Advertising Cookies on Our Sites\n<p>You may see a \u201ccookie banner\u201d on our websites and dashboards.\nIf you are visiting one of our sites from the EU, then we do not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you click to accept.\nWhen you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set advertising cookies on the site you are visiting and on our other websites, dashboards, and services, which we use to show you advertisements about our various Automattic products.\nWe\u2019ll display the banner to you periodically, just in case you change your mind.</p>\n<b>Consent and Choices for Advertisements on Our Users\u2019 Sites Through Our Ads Program</b>\n<p>You may see a \u201ccookie banner\u201d on our users\u2019 websites, particularly if you are in the European Union.\nIf so, then our ad program does not set, or allow our ad partners to set, cookies that are used to show you targeted ads before you accept.\n</p>\n<p>When you consent in this manner, we and our advertising partners may set third party advertising cookies in order to show you personalized ads on the website you are visiting and, if you are visiting a site in the WordPress.com network, on all websites within that network of sites.\nYou\u2019ll know that a site is in the WordPress.com network because it will have a WordPress.com subdomain (e.g., example.wordpress.com).\nFor other sites that participate in our ads program, your consent is only for personalized ads on the specific site you are visiting.</p>\n<p>\n<em>For visitors to sites in the WordPress.com network</em>:</p>\n<p>You can manage your privacy choices for third party advertising cookies for sites in the WordPress.com network by clicking \u201cLearn More\u201d on the banner, which will bring up our consent management platform (CMP).\nYou can also adjust your settings for sites in the WordPress.com network at any time by clicking on the \u201cPrivacy\u201d link displayed beneath every ad.</p>\n<p>In March 2021 we began rolling out a new CMP to some of our users as part of our transition to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe\u2019s Transparency and Consent Framework, which we will participate in as both a CMP provider and as a vendor (framework identification number 496).\nOur new CMP complies with the the framework\u2019s Specifications and Policies, and honors the choices you make using the IAB\u2019s tools.\nWithin the CMP we list as partners all the vendors that participate in the IAB\u2019s Framework.\nWe don\u2019t work with all of these vendors, but our ad partners listed above might, so we want you to give you the choice to deactivate them.\n(This is also why the list in our CMP is longer than you\u2019d expect!).</p>\n<p>\n<em>Other Choices:</em>\n</p>\n<p>We also set a cookie to help us understand how visitors engage with websites that participate in our ad program.\nVisitors may opt out of our use of this information by visiting this link (the opt-out will be processed immediately with no confirmation step).\nWhen you opt out, we replace the unique value for that cookie with an opt-out value.\nThe opt-out works across all websites in our ads program.\nIf you have opted out by accident&nbsp.\nor wish to opt back in, you may do so by visiting this link.\nPlease note that this option is browser-specific, so if you use a different device or browser or clear your cookies, then you will need to repeat the process.</p>\nContact Us\n<p>If you have any questions about

to that information.</p>\nCreative Commons Sharealike License\n<p>We\u2019ve decided to make this Privacy Policy available under a Creative Commons Sharealike license.\nYou can grab a copy of this Privacy Policy and other legal documents on GitHub.\nYou\u2019re more than welcome to copy it, adapt it, and repurpose it for your own use.\nJust make sure to revise the language so that your policy reflects your actual practices.\nIf you do use it, we\u2019d appreciate a credit and link to Automattic somewhere on your site.</p>\nInformation We Collect\n<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so \u2014 for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>\n<p>We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p>\n<em>Information You Provide to Us</em>\n<p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic account information: </strong>We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\nYou may provide us with more information \u2014 like your address and other information you want to share \u2014 but we don\u2019t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public profile information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\nFor example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an \u201cAbout Me\u201d description.\nYour public profile information is just that \u2014 public \u2014 so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment and contact information: </strong>If you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we\u2019ll collect information to process those payments and contact you.\nIf you buy something from us \u2014 a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a custom domain, some Longreads swag \u2014 or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you\u2019ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information.\nWe also keep a record of the purchases you\u2019ve made.\nIf you use our Ecommerce Services (including Store on WordPress.com, WooCommerce Shipping &amp.\nTax, and WooCommerce Payments), you\u2019ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL.\nYou may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.\nIf you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like WordAds, you\u2019ll provide some additional information \u2014 for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Business Profile: </b>Some of our products collect additional information from you as part of creating a user/customer profile.\nFor example, if you are a Jetpack CRM customer we may add you to our customer relationship database (powered by Jetpack CRM!) using information you provide us including your name, your employer, your job title or role, your contact information, and your communications with us.\nIf you are a Happy Tools user, we use information you provide us like your timezone and location information, your company and team information, and your contact information, to set up your account and power the Service\u2019s features.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content information: </strong>You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Credentials: </strong>Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).\nJetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications with us (hi there!): </strong>You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads.\nWhen you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Job applicant information:</strong> If you apply for a job with us \u2014 awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification as part of the application process.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Information We Collect Automatically</i>\n<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services \u2014 for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services \u2014 in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted \u201c[title of post]\u201d at [time/date]).\nOur WooCommerce Usage Tracker also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers.\nWe also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our Admin Bar and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.\nWe may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system\u2019s permissions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stored information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps.\nWe access this stored information through your device operating system\u2019s permissions.\nFor example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device\u2019s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interactions with other users\u2019 sites:</strong> We collect some information about your interactions with other users\u2019 sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your \u201cLikes\u201d and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you.\nAs another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from cookies &amp.\nother technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails.\nAutomattic uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.\nFor more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Information We Collect from Other Sources</i>\n<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature, we\u2019ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.\nAs another example, if you use WooCommerce Payments, we\u2019ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>\n<p>Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!).\nWe use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.</p>\nHow and Why We Use Information\n<i>Purposes for Using Information</i>\n<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, host your website, backup and restore your website, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong> For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services.\nOr, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To place and manage ads in our advertising program.</strong> For example, to place ads on our users\u2019 sites and some of our own sites as part of our advertising program, and understand ad performance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting security incidents.\ndetecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.\nfighting spam.\ncomplying with our legal obligations.\nand protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Automattic.\ntexting you to verify your payment.\nor calling you to share offers and promotions that we think will be of interest to you.\nIf you don\u2019t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time.\n(If you opt out, we\u2019ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To recruit and hire new Automatticians.</strong> For example, by evaluating job applicants and communicating with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Legal Bases for Collecting

obligation.\nor</p>\n<p>(3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person.\nor</p>\n<p>(4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information \u2014 for

Policy.</p>\nSharing Information\n<i>How We Share Information</i>\n<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.\nThese are spelled out below, as well as in the section called Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf.\nWe require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site.\nThis includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooCommerce Payments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic).\nthose that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services).\nthose that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).\nthose that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams).\nother third-party tools that help us manage operations.\nand companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you.\nWe require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.\nOther vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our Cookie Policy).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.\nFor more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our Legal Guidelines.\nAdditionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\u2019 (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies.\nFor example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers.\nPlease see our Domain Registrations and Privacy support document for more details.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large.\nFor example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nIf any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\nFor example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Site owners: </strong>If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site.\nFor example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.\nOr if you make a payment (like via the Payments feature) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site.<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users\u2019 data.\nWe aren\u2019t a data broker, we don\u2019t sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don\u2019t sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>\n<p>We show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites as well as some of our own, and the revenue they generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn\u2019t become an obstacle to having a voice.</p>\n<p>Under a new California law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), some personalized advertising you see online and on our services might be considered a \u201csale\u201d even though we don\u2019t share information that identifies you personally, like your name or email address, as part of our advertising program.</p>\n<p>You have choices about these ads, learn more about them and our ads program.</p>\n<i>Information Shared Publicly</i>\n<p>Information that you choose to make public is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 disclosed publicly.</p>\n<p>That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your \u201cLikes\u201d and comments on other websites are all available to others \u2014 and we hope they get a lot of views!</p>\n<p>For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven\u2019t uploaded one, is your <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>R</strong>ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar \u2014 get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and \u201cLikes\u201d that you make on other users\u2019 websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nYour Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, \u201cLikes,\u201d and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.</p>\n<p>We also provide a \u201cFirehose\u201d stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly.\nFind out more about opting out of the Firehose for WordPress.com and Jetpack sites.\nPublic information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>\n<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>\nHow Long We Keep Information\n<p>We generally discard information about you when it\u2019s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it \u2014 described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information \u2014 and we\u2019re not legally required to keep it.</p>\n<p>For example, we keep web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic\u2019s websites, like the visitor\u2019s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days.\nWe retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic\u2019s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>\n<p>As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun.\nAfter the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>\nSecurity\n<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.\nWe monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>\n<p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication.</p>\nChoices\n<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information.\nPlease keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services \u2014 for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge \u2014 may not be accessible.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit access to information on your mobile device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps.\nIf you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us.\nJust follow the instructions in those communications or let us know.\nIf you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, Automattic does not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals across all of our Services.\nHowever, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic\u2019s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt out of our internal analytics program:</strong> You can do this through your user settings.\nBy opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you\u2019re logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nFor more information, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Close your account:</strong> While we\u2019d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services.\n(Here are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above \u2014 for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>\n</ul>\nYour Rights\n<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the \u201cGDPR\u201d), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>\n<em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em>\n<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to your personal data;</li>\n<li>Request correction or deletion of your personal data;</li>\n<li>Object to our use and processing of your personal data;</li>\n<li>Request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data.\nand</li>\n<li>Request portability of your personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have the right to make a complaint to a government supervisory authority.</p>\n<em>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</em>\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.</p>\n<p>The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the \u201ccategories\u201d of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is.\nIn the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>\n<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>\n<li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);</li>\n<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services, like the actions you take as an administrator of a WordPress.com site);</li>\n<li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>\n<li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);</li>\n<li>Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information if you are a Happy Tools user, or information you provide in a job application).\nand</li>\n<li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above.</p>\n<p>We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section.\nAnd we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section.</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li>\n<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>\n<li>Opt out of any sale of personal information.\nand</li>\n<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n<em>The CCPA &amp.\nPersonalized Advertising in Our Ads Program</em>\n</strong>\n<p>Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible.\nWe show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn\u2019t become an obstacle to having a voice.\nOur ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites.\nAs part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users\u2019 sites and some of our own.</p>\n<p>The personal information we share includes online identifiers.\ninternet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address).\nand geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address).\nThese disclosures may be considered a \u201csale\u201d of information under the CCPA.\nWe do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information.\nWe don\u2019t knowingly sell personal information of those under 16.\nLearn how you can opt out by going to California: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>\n<em>Contacting Us About These Rights</em>\n<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren\u2019t able to or you\u2019d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to \u201cHow to Reach Us\u201d to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>\n<p>When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we\u2019ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything.\nFor example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account.\nYou can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization.\nWe may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>\nControllers and Responsible Companies\n<p>Automattic\u2019s Services are worldwide.\nDifferent Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.</p>\n<p>Depending on the Services you use, more than one company may be the controller of your personal data.\nGenerally, the \u201ccontroller\u201d is the Automattic company that entered into the contract with you

communicate with you, or to make our Services better.</p>\n<p>We collect this information from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.\nLet\u2019s go over the information that we collect.</p>\n<em>Information You Provide to Us</em>\n<p>It\u2019s probably no surprise that we collect information that you provide to us directly.\nHere are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic account information: </strong>We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account.\nFor example, we require individuals who sign up for a WordPress.com account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name \u2014 and that\u2019s it.\nYou may provide us with more information \u2014 like your address and other information you want to share \u2014 but we don\u2019t require that information to create a WordPress.com account.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public profile information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we collect the information that you provide for your public profile.\nFor example, if you have a WordPress.com account, your username is part of that public profile, along with any other information you put into your public profile, like a photo or an \u201cAbout Me\u201d description.\nYour public profile information is just that \u2014 public \u2014 so please keep that in mind when deciding what information you would like to include.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Payment and contact information: </strong>If you buy something from us or earn revenue through your site, we\u2019ll collect information to process those payments and contact you.\nIf you buy something from us \u2014 a subscription to a WordPress.com plan, a premium theme, a custom domain, some Longreads swag \u2014 or if you pay fees to a person or business through their WordPress.com site (for example via the Payments feature or the Pay with PayPal block), you\u2019ll provide additional personal and payment information like your name, credit card information, and contact information.\nWe also keep a record of the purchases you\u2019ve made.\nIf you use our Ecommerce Services (including Store on WordPress.com,&nbsp;the WooCommerce Shipping &amp.\nTax, and WooCommerce Payments), you\u2019ll have to create a WordPress.com account or connect an existing account and, for some Services, provide your site URL.\nYou may also provide us with financial details to set up a payments integration, like the email address for your Stripe or PayPal account or your bank account information.\nIf you participate in a revenue sharing opportunity for your site, like WordAds, you\u2019ll provide some additional information \u2014 for example, a tax ID or other identifier so we can process payments to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Happy Tools information: </strong>If you are a Happy Tools user, you will provide us with information to set up your Happy Tools account and make use of the Service\u2019s features.\nFor example, you might enter timezone and location information, company and team information, and contact information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Content information: </strong>You might provide us with information about you in draft and published content (a blog post or comment that includes biographic information about you, or any media or files you upload).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Credentials: </strong>Depending on the Services you use, you may provide us with credentials for your self-hosted website (like SSH, FTP, and SFTP username and password).\nJetpack and VaultPress users may provide us with these credentials in order to use our one-click restore feature if there is a problem with their site, or to allow us to troubleshoot problems more quickly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications with us (hi there!): </strong>You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our Happiness Engineers about a support question, post a question in our public forums, or sign up for a newsletter like the one we send through Longreads.\nWhen you communicate with us via form, email, phone, WordPress.com comment, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Job applicant information:</strong> If you apply for a job with us \u2014 awesome! You may provide us with information like your name, contact information, resume or CV, and work authorization verification as part of the application process.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Information We Collect Automatically</i>\n<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.\nWe collect log information when you use our Services \u2014 for example, when you create or make changes to your website on WordPress.com.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage information:</strong> We collect information about your usage of our Services.\nFor example, we collect information about the actions that site administrators and users perform on a site using our WordPress.com or Jetpack services \u2014 in other words, who did what and when (e.g., [WordPress.com username] deleted \u201c[title of post]\u201d at [time/date]).\nOur WooCommerce Usage Tracker also tracks information like your email address, WooCommerce settings, and PHP settings, along with information about your online store, like the aggregate number of orders and customers.\nWe also collect information about what happens when you use our Services (e.g., page views, support document searches at en.support.wordpress.com, features enabled for your website, interactions with our Admin Bar and other parts of our Services) along with information about your device (e.g., screen size, name of cellular network, and mobile device manufacturer).\nWe use this information to, for example, provide our Services to you, get insights on how people use our Services so we can make our Services better, and understand and make predictions about user retention.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location information:</strong> We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address.\nWe collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.\nWe may also collect information about your precise location via our mobile apps (like when you post a photograph with location information) if you allow us to do so through your mobile device operating system\u2019s permissions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Stored information:</strong> We may access information stored on your mobile device via our mobile apps.\nWe access this stored information through your device operating system\u2019s permissions.\nFor example, if you give us permission to access the photographs on your mobile device\u2019s camera roll, our Services may access the photos stored on your device when you upload a really amazing photograph of the sunrise to your website.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Interactions with other users\u2019 sites:</strong> We collect some information about your interactions with other users\u2019 sites while you are logged in to your account with us, such as your \u201cLikes\u201d and the fact that you commented on a particular post, so that we can, for example, recommend posts we think may interest you.\nAs another example, we collect information about the comments IntenseDebate users make while logged in and use that information to, for example, tally up statistics about your comments (check them out in your dashboard!) and display information about your comments in your IntenseDebate public profile.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information from cookies &amp.\nother technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nPixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of

track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads.\nFor more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Information We Collect from Other Sources</i>\n<p>We may also get information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you create or log in to your WordPress.com account through another service (like Google) or if you connect your website or account to a social media service (like Twitter) through our Publicize feature, we\u2019ll receive information from that service (e.g., your username, basic profile information, friends list) via the authorization procedures for that service.\nAs another example, if you use WooCommerce Payments, we\u2019ll receive information relating to your Stripe account, such as your email address and phone number.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you use or authorize and what options are available.</p>\n<p>Third-party services may also give us information, like mailing addresses for individuals who are not yet our users (but we hope will be!).\nWe use this information for marketing purposes like postcards and other mailers advertising our Services.</p>\nHow and Why We Use Information\n<i>Purposes for Using Information</i>\n<p>We use information about you for the

of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong> For example, by detecting security incidents.\ndetecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity.\nfighting spam.\ncomplying with our legal obligations.\nand protecting the rights and property of Automattic and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services, recommending content through our Reader post suggestions, and providing new essays and stories through Longreads for your reading pleasure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your

will be of interest to you.\nIf you don\u2019t want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time.\n(If you opt out, we\u2019ll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To recruit and hire new Automatticians.</strong> For example, by evaluating job applicants and communicating with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<i>Legal Bases for Collecting

Policy.</p>\nSharing Information\n<i>How We Share Information</i>\n<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.\nThese are spelled out below, as well as in the section called Ads and Analytics Services Provided by Others:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf.\nWe require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site.\nThis includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, which powers WooCommerce Payments, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, payment providers you use for your own ecommerce operations, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you, registrars, registries, data escrow services that allow us to provide domain registration services, and your hosting provider if your site is not hosted by Automattic).\nthose that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services).\nthose that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers).\nthose that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams).\nother third-party tools that help us manage operations.\nand companies that make products available on our websites (like the extensions on WooCommerce.com), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you.\nWe require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them.\nOther vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our Cookie Policy).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.\nFor more information on how we respond to requests for information about WordPress.com users, please see our Legal Guidelines.\nAdditionally, if you have a domain registered with WordPress.com, we may share your information to comply with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers\u2019 (ICANN) regulations, rules, or policies.\nFor example, your information relating to your domain registration may be available in the WHOIS database, or we may be required to share your information with ICANN-approved Dispute Resolution Service Providers.\nPlease see our Domain Registrations and Privacy support document for more details.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Automattic, third parties, or the public at large.\nFor example, if we have a good faith belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury, we may disclose information related to the emergency without delay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Automattic goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nIf any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction.\nFor example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so, like when you connected your site to a social media service through our Publicize feature.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you.\nFor instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Site owners: </strong>If you have a WordPress.com account and interact with another site using our Services, your information may be shared with the administrators of the site.\nFor example, if you leave a comment on a site created on WordPress.com or running Jetpack, your IP address and the email address associated with your WordPress.com account may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site where you left the comment.\nOr if you make a payment (like via the Payments feature) to a site, your public display name, user name, and email address may be shared with the administrator(s) of the site.<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users\u2019 data.\nWe aren\u2019t a data broker, we don\u2019t sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don\u2019t sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>\n<p>We show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites as well as some of our own, and the revenue they generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn\u2019t become an obstacle to having a voice.</p>\n<p>Under a new California law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), some personalized advertising you see online and on our services might be considered a \u201csale\u201d even though we don\u2019t share information that identifies you personally, like your name or email address, as part of our advertising program.</p>\n<p>You have choices about these ads, learn more about them and our ads program.</p>\n<i>Information Shared Publicly</i>\n<p>Information that you choose to make public is \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 disclosed publicly.</p>\n<p>That means information like your public profile, posts, other content that you make public on your website, and your \u201cLikes\u201d and comments on other websites are all available to others \u2014 and we hope they get a lot of views!</p>\n<p>For example, the photo that you upload to your public profile, or a default image if you haven\u2019t uploaded one, is your <strong>G</strong>lobally <strong>R</strong>ecognized Avatar, or Gravatar \u2014 get it? :) Your Gravatar, along with other public profile information, displays alongside the comments and \u201cLikes\u201d that you make on other users\u2019 websites while logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nYour Gravatar and public profile information may also display with your comments, \u201cLikes,\u201d and other interactions on websites that use our Gravatar service, if the email address associated with your account is the same email address you use on the other website.</p>\n<p>We also provide a \u201cFirehose\u201d stream of public data (like posts and comments) from some sites that use our Services to provide that data to Firehose subscribers, who may view and analyze the content (all subject to our Terms of Service), but do not have rights to re-publish it publicly.\nFind out more about opting out of the Firehose for WordPress.com and Jetpack sites.\nPublic information may also be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>\n<p>Please keep all of this in mind when deciding what you would like to share publicly.</p>\nHow Long We Keep Information\n<p>We generally discard information about you when it\u2019s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it \u2014 described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information \u2014 and we\u2019re not legally required to keep it.</p>\n<p>For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor to one of Automattic\u2019s websites, like the visitor\u2019s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days.\nWe retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic to Automattic\u2019s websites and investigate issues if something goes wrong on one of our websites.</p>\n<p>As another example, when you delete a post, page, or comment from your WordPress.com site, it stays in your Trash folder for thirty days in case you change your mind and would like to restore that content, because starting from scratch is no fun.\nAfter the thirty days are up, the deleted content may remain on our backups and caches until purged.</p>\nSecurity\n<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.\nWe monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>\n<p>To enhance the security of your account, we encourage you to enable our advanced security settings, like Two Step Authentication.</p>\nChoices\n<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information.\nPlease keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services \u2014 for example, premium themes that carry an additional charge \u2014 may not be accessible.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limit access to information on your mobile device:</strong> Your mobile device operating system should provide you with the option to discontinue our ability to collect stored information or location information via our mobile apps.\nIf you choose to limit this, you may not be able to use certain features, like geotagging for photographs.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us.\nJust follow the instructions in those communications or let us know.\nIf you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set your browser to reject cookies:</strong> At this time, Automattic does not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals across all of our Services.\nHowever, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using Automattic\u2019s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Automattic\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opt out of our internal analytics program:</strong> You can do this through your user settings.\nBy opting out, you will stop sharing information with our analytics tool about events or actions that happen after the opt-out, while you\u2019re logged in to your WordPress.com account.\nFor more information, please see our Cookie Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Close your account:</strong> While we\u2019d be very sad to see you go, you can close your account if you no longer want to use our Services.\n(Here are account closure instructions for WordPress.com accounts.) Please keep in mind that we may continue to retain your information after closing your account, as described in How Long We Keep Information above \u2014 for example, when that information is reasonably needed to comply with (or demonstrate our compliance with) legal obligations such as law enforcement requests, or reasonably needed for our legitimate business interests.</li>\n</ul>\nYour Rights\n<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the \u201cGDPR\u201d), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>\n<em>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em>\n<p>If

residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it.</p>\n<p>The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the \u201ccategories\u201d of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is.\nIn the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>\n<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>\n<li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as

the Information We Collect section above.</p>\n<p>We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section.\nAnd we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section.</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li>\n<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>\n<li>Opt out of any sale of personal information.\nand</li>\n<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>\n<em>The CCPA &amp.\nPersonalized Advertising in Our Ads Program</em>\n</strong>\n<p>Our mission is to democratize publishing and commerce, and that means making our Services accessible to as many people as possible.\nWe show ads on some of our users\u2019 sites as well as some of our own sites, and the revenue these ads generate lets us offer free access to some of our Services so that money doesn\u2019t become an obstacle to having a voice.\nOur ads program also allows our users to earn revenue to support and grow their own sites.\nAs part of our advertising program, we and our users do use cookies to share certain device identifiers and information about your browsing activities with our advertising partners, and those advertising partners may use that information to show you personalized ads on some of our users\u2019 sites and some of our own.</p>\n<p>The personal information we share includes online identifiers.\ninternet or other network or device activity (such as cookie information, other device identifiers, and IP address).\nand geolocation data (approximate location information from your IP address).\nThese disclosures may be considered a \u201csale\u201d of information under the CCPA.\nWe do not sell (or share) information through our ads program that identifies you personally, like your name or contact information.\nWe don\u2019t knowingly sell personal information of those under 16.\nLearn how you can opt out by going to California: Do Not Sell My Personal Information.</p>\n<em>Contacting Us About These Rights</em>\n<p>You can usually access, correct, or delete your personal data using your account settings and tools that we offer, but if you aren\u2019t able to or you\u2019d like to contact us about one of the other rights, scroll down to \u201cHow to Reach Us\u201d to, well, find out how to reach us.</p>\n<p>When you contact us about one of your rights under this section, we\u2019ll need to verify that you are the right person before we disclose or delete anything.\nFor example, if you are a user, we will need you to contact us from the email address associated with your account.\nYou can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf by giving us written authorization.\nWe may still require you to verify your identity with us.</p>\nControllers and Responsible Companies\n<p>Automattic\u2019s Services are worldwide.\nDifferent Automattic companies are the controller (or co-controller) of personal information, which means that they are the company responsible for processing that information, based on the particular service and the location of the individual using our Services.</p>\n<p>Depending
