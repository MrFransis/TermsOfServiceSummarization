"\nHelp Terms of Service <p>We strive to uphold the ideals of freedom of speech on this website.\nHowever, to stay within the confines of applicable law, there are certain rules you must obey with content you upload to this site.\nWhat you can and cannot post is listed below.\nIf what you wish to post is not listed, you can assume that this isn't the place to post it.</p>\n<p>\nYou may:<br>\n<br>\n- Post galleries featuring legally drawn characters of any kind, including anime-style drawings and western-style cartoons, both pornographic and non-pornographic.\nAlternative stuff is allowed, but please mark the gallery appropriately in the title.<br>\n<br>\n- Post real high-quality cosplay that complies with US and international law.<br>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\nYou may NOT:<br>\n<br>\n- Post any kind of material that contains or depicts people who are or appear to be underage (even if they are borderline), nor galleries that claim to contain this kind of content (using keywords like \"lolita\", \"preteen\", \"incest\", \"lolicon\" or derivatives, even if they do not contain this).\nThis includes drawings and underage \"models\" who do not engage in actual sexual activity, as well as normal photos involving children.\n<strong>ANY KIND OF ILLICIT ACTIVITY INVOLVING CHILDREN WILL BE REPORTED ALONG WITH A FULL TRACE OF ALL YOUR ACTIVITY ON THIS SITE.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n- Post photograpic material of real people that can be considered \"obscene\".\nThis includes extreme BDSM, bestiality, scat, and other stuff that is way \"out there\".\nThis isn't where to come for that stuff, please go away.<br>\n<br>\n- Post any kind of drawn or virtual material that violates the principles above.\nThis explicitly includes, but is not limited to, computer-generated images (\"rendered\") and images created based on real people or pictures (\"rotoscoped\").\nIf it resembles or was obviously manufactured to resemble the real thing, this rule particularly applies.<br>\n<br>\n- Post material listed in our E-Hentai Prohibited Content and Artists thread.\nWe know that you did not obtain permission for these, so don't even try.<br>\n<br>\n- Post photographic material of real people that does not fit under the Cosplay category.<br>\n<br>\n- ANY KIND OF MATERIAL INVOLVING CHILDREN IS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT PORNOGRAPHIC OR RISQUE IN NATURE, AND EVEN IF THEY CONTAIN NO NUDITY NOR POSES WITH SEXUAL IMPLICATIONS.\nJUST A SINGLE VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL CAUSE YOUR ACCOUNT TO BE PERMANENTLY BANNED, AND IF THE MATERIAL IS ILLICIT, YOUR DETAILS TO BE HANDED OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES IN YOUR JURISDICTION.<br>\n<br>\n- Computer-generated or \"virtual\" child pornography is just as prohibited as the real stuff.\nUploading this type of images is a one-strike-and-you're-out infraction.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you violate the rules, you agree that we can submit your browsing history, uploading history, posting history, medical history, any and all IP addresses you have ever browsed or posted with, proxy traces, e-mail addresses, referring web sites, browser type, blood type, favorite stuffed

anyone we damn well please.\nSo be warned.\n</p> Posting Guidelines <p>\nActivity that violates one or more of the following guidelines may cause your galleries to be expunged, and your account to be

gallery.<br>\n<br>\n- Excessive updates to or \"bumping\" of galleries must be avoided.\n\"Excessive\" should generally be interpreted as more than twice per month.<br>\n<br>\n- Avoid posting galleries with just a few images unless it is naturally released as such.\n\"A few\" should generally be interpreted as less than eight.<br>\n</p> Content Licensing <p>\nYou agree that, upon uploading

viewable section of the galleries that are available for access for everyone.\nIn order to improve the experience for out visitors, there are certain restrictions in place on what types of content can be classified as which category.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Doujinshi, Manga, Artist CG, Game CG and Image Set sections should only be used for corresponding content that contain \"hentai\" or \"ecchi\" material.\nAll non-H material should be posted as \"Non-H\".\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Cosplay section should only be used for real people involved in \"costume play\".\nThis includes but is not limited to characters from anime, manga or games.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Western section should only be used for western-style drawn art of a sexual nature (\"cartoon porn\").\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Misc section can be used as a generic category for stuff that doesn't fall under the other ones, but that still would hold some interest for the average E-Hentai visitor.\n</p>\n<p>\nDo not post low quality or irrelevant material.\nDo not post non-cosplay photographic porn or other images of real people.\nExcessive amounts of crap can get you banned without warning.\n</p> Copyright and Intellectual Property E-Hentai

gallery in question, or by emailing a list of links to the galleries in question to <strong>reports (a) e-hentai period org</strong>.\nPlease make sure to include all the information
