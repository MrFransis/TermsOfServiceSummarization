court or having a jury trial.</p>\n<p>No Representative Actions.\nYou and Company agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site is personal to you and Company and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</p>\n<p>Arbitration of Disputes.\nExcept for small claims disputes in which you or Company seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Company seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and Company waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Site, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) resolved in court.\nInstead, for any Dispute

will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator.\nArbitration proceedings will be held in Washington, District of Columbia unless you are a consumer, in which case you

15 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1, et seq.\n(the \u201cFAA\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\nAs limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability.\nThe arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute.\nThe arbitrator, Company, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.\nThe duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</p>\n<p>You and Company agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee (up to a maximum of $250 if you are a consumer), and Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs.\nFor any arbitration initiated by Company, Company will pay all JAMS fees and costs.\nYou and Company agree that the state or federal courts of Washington, District of Columbia and the United States sitting in District of Columbia have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>\n<p>Any Dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose.\notherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and Company will not have the right to assert the claim.</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 15 by providing notice to the Company at admin@gowithcharlotte.com.\nIn order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration.\nBy opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 16.</p>\n<p>If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms.\n(b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 15 or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 15.\nand (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.\nFurther, if any part of this Section 15 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.</p> 16.\nGoverning Law and
