If you are an individual (acting as a consumer) who is based in a Member State of the European Union or the UK (whether or not the UK remains an EU Member State), please note that these Terms of Use

users).&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>WHAT TERMS APPLY TO USE OF OUR DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP OFFERINGS BY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM?</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Please note that the terms that govern and condition UK-based Educational Institutions\u2019 use of our Digital Citizenship Offerings are our UK Digital Citizenship Terms of Service (together with the associated Data Processing Addendum, which covers our Processing of certain Personal Data on behalf of such Educational Institutions).</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>If you are an educator in UK or otherwise act on behalf of a UK-based Educational Institution, please read our UK Digital Citizenship Terms of Service carefully.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The application of the UK Digital Citizenship Terms of Service to UK-based Educational Institution\u2019s use of the Digital Citizenship Offerings does not affect or limit the general application of these Terms of Use to you and your use of the Site.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU SUBSCRIBE TO MEMBER SERVICES, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS OF THE SAME DURATION AS YOUR INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION AT CSM'S THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION FEE UNLESS YOU DECLINE TO RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIBE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 8 BELOW.\nMEMBER SERVICES ARE PROHIBITED IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES: CUBA, IRAN, LEBANON, SYRIA, NORTH KOREA, LIBYA, SUDAN, SOMALIA, AND BY SUBSCRIBING TO MEMBER SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE NOT LOCATED IN THOSE COUNTRIES.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 17 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS OF ANY KIND.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that these Terms of Use are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged.\nFrom time to time, these Terms of Use may be changed, expanded or amended, and may include the introduction of additional terms for certain Site features.\nAny changes to these Terms of Use may be made without notice and will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site, so please be sure to review them on a regular basis.\nThe effective date appearing at the top of this page indicates when the latest changes were made to these Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to Member Services, CSM will also provide notice of material changes the Terms of Use to the last e-mail you provided when registering your account.\nIf you refuse to accept the updated Terms of Use then CSM reserves its right to discontinue your use of the Member Services.</p>\n<p>To assist you with your review of these Terms of Use, we provide at the end of most sections a short, very high-level summary of the applicable section.\n<strong>These summaries are included for reference purposes only, do not constitute contractual terms and are not a substitute for reading the actual contractual terms.\nthe summaries will not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms of Use, and, in all cases, the substantive terms of these Terms of Use (and not any summary) will govern and take priority over any summary.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Summary</u>:<br> Welcome to our Site! We are Common Sense Media.\nWe know that Terms of Use can be very long, so we have tried to summarize the key concepts for you in summary boxes throughout these Terms of Use in non-legalese.\nAlthough these summaries are helpful, please be sure to read all terms carefully, because the language in each Section (aside from these summaries) is the legally binding language.\nThese terms apply to you if you are over the age of 18 or are a parent or guardian entering into these terms on behalf of a child under the age of 13.\nIf you fall into one of these categories, and if you use the Site, you are indicating that you agree with these terms.\nIf you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please navigate to the Teen Terms of Use, because those terms will govern your use of the Site.\nWe may change these terms at any time and may do so simply by posting a revised version here.\nYou can always check if we have changed the terms by looking to the date at the top of the page.\nIf they have been modified, you will want to take time to review what has changed.\nYou will also want to take a close look at Section 17, which requires that legal disagreements between you and us be resolved through binding arbitration, rather than in a court room before a judge and jury.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nMATERIALS ON THE SITE AND RELATED RIGHTS AND RESTRICTIONS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The information and materials provided through the Site, including any data, text, photographs, graphics, images, music, audio and video clips, logos, icons, software and links (collectively, the

site?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We support the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (<strong>COPPA</strong>) and other frameworks like the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the so-called UK GDPR (together, the <strong>GDPR</strong>), which endorse the protection of children and their data.\nOur goal is to minimize the information gathered from and disseminated about kids while permitting them active participation with the trustworthy information, education, and independent voice for which we are known.&nbsp.\nUnder COPPA in the United States, children for these purposes are considered to be individuals under the age of 13.\nThis age range may vary in other countries and regions.\nWhere consent is required or recommended for a particular purpose or practice, we aim to get parental consent for youth in accordance with the age designated by the country they are in.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For teens 13 and over, once an account is created (with parental consent as needed) we take extra steps to limit information collected and protect privacy, as described in this policy.</p>\n<p>For children under 13, we have especially strict limitations about what personal information can be collected and viewed about kids and how and when they can be contacted.\nPlease see our&nbsp;Children's Privacy Policy&nbsp;for additional information pertaining to our policies relating to the use of

Account\" link located towards the bottom of the page.\nOnce you delete your account, all of your Personal Information stored in your account and Profile on our site will be removed and any reviews

delete your account.\nOr, you can contact us at&nbsp;Contact Support&nbsp;and request that we delete your content (including reviews) and account for you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if you decide

Page.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION THROUGH ANY PAYMENT SERVICE PAGE OR THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF THE PAYMENT

respond to your requests or inquiries and provide related customer service).\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>Additional Communications.</i>&nbsp;If you register to become a Member of our community or sign up to receive one of our e-newsletters, we may use the Personal Information submitted in connection with your application to contact you with surveys or important communications regarding Common Sense Media.\nWe may additionally use Personal Information to contact you about Common Sense content, features, opportunities, and products that may be of interest to you.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>Membership.</i>&nbsp;If you become a Member, we may use your Personal Information to maintain and update your Profile and postings in our online reviews, surveys and polls.\nAll content that you submit to the Services is governed by our&nbsp;Terms of Use.\nWe may also use Personal Information to send updates and communications to our Members, such as our e-newsletters, surveys and other important Common Sense Media communications such as information regarding the Services or changes to our terms, conditions and policies.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>Internal Operations and Analysis.</i>&nbsp;We may also use Personal Information about you for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, enhancing or modifying our products and services, and so forth.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may also use Personal Information to personalize your experience on the Services by presenting content and market opportunities and products tailored to you and to allow you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions and to administer these activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nHow We Use Information Collected Through Digital Citizenship Quizzes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Quizzes provided by Common Sense Education are available at the end of each lesson in the Digital Citizenship Curriculum.\nEach quiz includes 4-6 questions that have varied formats: multiple choice, drag and drop to complete a sentence, and drag and drop sorting.\nThe quiz is autograded and students can see their results immediately.\nThe quizzes are intended to assess student understanding after the teacher has completed the corresponding lesson.</p>\n<p>Common Sense quiz reports (for the entire class and individual student) are only accessible to a teacher who is authenticated with Google Classroom and who requests specific quiz reports on specified students authenticated with Google Classroom.\nCommon Sense works with the following third party service providers to provide Google Classroom integrated quizzes through the Digital Citizenship curriculum:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Learning Locker</strong>\n<br> Learning Locker is a Learning Record Store (LRS) database-driven application and analytics tool designed specifically for the learning sector.\nCommon Sense uses Learning Locker to store, sort and share data as recorded using the xAPI specification from Google Classroom.\nLearning Locker may collect and store the following information including, but not limited to: Google User ID, quiz_id, quiz name, start time, start date, quiz completion, stop time, stop date, quiz duration, quiz questions, alphanumeric answers, quiz grade, and quiz ranking.\nPlease read Learning Locker\u2019s privacy policy for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Google Classroom</strong>\n<br> Google Classroom is a free web service developed by Google and part of the G Suite for Education to help schools streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students.\nStudents using Google Classroom can view assignments, submit homework, and receive grades from teachers to help them stay on track and organized.\nThe G Suite for Education core services are the heart of Google\u2019s educational offering to schools.\nThe core services include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts and Vault.\nPlease read Google Classroom\u2019s privacy policy for more information.\n<p> The Google Classroom service provides Common Sense with a Google Classroom authenticated teacher\u2019s class roster of student Google IDs.\nOnly authenticated teachers can access student first and last names associated with Google IDs for quiz reporting purposes.\nCommon Sense requests authorization from teachers to access their Google Classroom class roster of student Google IDs in order to combine all the specified student Google IDs present in the class roster with their respective Common Sense quiz submission data and quiz grades in order to generate class and individual student quiz reports for teachers.\nAll quiz reports are generated on-demand by the Google Classroom authenticated teacher and are not stored or retained by Common Sense.\nWhen a teacher requests a \"class roster\" or individual \u201cstudent\u201d quiz report, Common Sense loads the teacher\u2019s specified Google IDs from our third-party service provider Learning Locker and matches student IDs with Google Classroom to create and display a class roster quiz report for the entire class, or individual student report to produce a Google Classroom listing that includes student names paired with quiz scores.\nCommon Sense and our third-party service providers do not store or retain any class or individual student report data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nHow We Use Information Collected Via Cookies and Other Technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use

Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum Training.</em>&nbsp;For Educator users who complete our Digital Literacy and Citizenship Curriculum Training, if requested by your school district, we may share your first and last name, school name, and completion date.\nThe purpose of sharing this data is to help your district understand which teachers have received instruction on the Common Sense curriculum.\nAdditionally, if your school receives E-rate support, it will help your district comply with CIPA.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Third-Party Service Providers.</em>&nbsp;We work with third-parties who provide services such as data analysis, payment or donation processing, order fulfillment, infrastructure provision, information technology services, content personalization, email delivery services,

levels of control over the extent to which content or information you submit to the Services is also made public and shared on linked Social Networking and/or Single Sign-On Services.\nWhen you use a

child;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>how we use it and why.\nand&nbsp;</li>\n<li>how the parent can revoke their consent and/or ask that we delete their child\u2019s Profile and their Personal
