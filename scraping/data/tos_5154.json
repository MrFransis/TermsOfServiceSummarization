share a user\u2019s information with a Counselor and a Counselor\u2019s information with a user.\nWe may also share your information with vendors and service providers, including our data hosting and

use \"cookies\" and \"web beacons\" (also known as pixels) to collect information.\nA \"cookie\" is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.\nWe collect cookies that are necessary for the Platform to function, cookies that enhance the Platform\u2019s performance, and cookies used for third-party tracking.\nA \"web beacon\" is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a Web page or email that can report your visit or use to a third party.\nWeb beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users at a website for the purpose of web analytics, advertising optimization, or page tagging.\nAdditional information regarding web beacons is available on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>You can change your browser's settings so it will stop accepting cookies and web beacons or to prompt you before accepting a cookie or web beacon.\nOpt-out options for cookies and web beacons are located here.</p> Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Analytics <p>We may use third party cookies or web beacons for the purposes of web analytics, attribution, and error management.\nOur Platform may use vendor services that use cookies, web beacons, and similar technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, including when you pay for services, load a page, indicate that you heard about us on television, sign up for services, enter your payment information (but the payment details are not disclosed), start the intake questionnaire, and your response as to the referral source to the Platform.</p>\n<p>Our Platform also uses analytics vendors to collect information (for example, Visitor Data and Onboarding Data) about user actions on our websites for purposes of analytics and analysis of certain Platform usage.</p> Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Advertising Networks <p>You and others may see certain ads for our services or for the Platform on other websites because we participate in ad networks.\nAd networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means.\nThese networks track individuals\u2019 online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons.\nThe networks use this information to show advertisements that may be tailored to an individual\u2019s interests.\nThe information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites.\nThis data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks.\nThis process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and assists other websites and advertising partners to find you or people like you on different platforms, including social media websites.\nAs mentioned above, you can opt-out of cookies and web beacons by visiting this link here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Social and General Information Tools <p>We use several publicly-available tools and information exchange resources, such as (but not limited to) a blog, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and others (collectively \"Social and General Information Tools\").\nAny information you provide or share while using Social and General Information Tools may be read, accessed, collected by that site and users of that site according to their Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Phishing <p>Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as \"phishing\", are of great concern.\nYou should always be diligent when you are being asked for your account information and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system.\nWe will never request your login information or your credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication (email, phone or otherwise).</p>\n</li>\n<li>Links <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties.\nIf you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service.\nThe fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.\nWe do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Security of Information <p>While using any Internet-based service carries inherent security risks that cannot be 100% prevented, our systems, infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built and maintained with your security and privacy in mind.\nWe apply industry standards and best practices to prevent any unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.\nWe comply with all applicable federal laws, state laws, and regulations regarding data privacy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Service Providers <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Platform, to perform certain tasks which are related to the Platform, or to provide audit, legal, operational or other services for us.\nThese tasks include, but not limited to, customer service, technical maintenance, monitoring, email management and communication, database management, billing and payment processing, reporting and analytics.\nWe will share with them only the minimum necessary information to perform their task for us

Information from a child under age 13 please let us know by contacting us and we will delete that information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law.\nWe may disclose information necessary or appropriate to protect the safety of the public or any person, to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), and to prevent or stop activity that may be illegal or dangerous.\nYou should also be aware that Counselors may be obliged to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities to conform to their professional and legal responsibilities.\nSpecifically, and without limitation, you should be aware that the law requires mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action in the following cases: (a) reported or suspected abuse of a child or vulnerable adult.\n(b) serious suicidal potential.\n(c) threatened harm to another person.\n(d) court-ordered presentation of treatment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Changes to the Privacy Policy <p>We may update this privacy statement at our sole discretion.\nThe date of the last revision of this policy appears at the end of this page.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our Privacy Policy and practices.\nRegardless of changes
