WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>Limitation of Liability</i>.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE INRUPT PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK

(D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<i>Indemnity</i>.\nYou agree to indemnify and hold the Inrupt Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to your violation of these Terms.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>\n<p>\n<i>Assignment</i>.\nYou may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Inrupt's prior written consent.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Choice of Law</i>.\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Arbitration Agreement</i>\n</b>\n<i>.\n</i>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Inrupt and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Inrupt.\nBoth you and Inrupt acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Inrupt's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>\n<p>\n<i>(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement</i>.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cRules\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b) <i>Costs of Arbitration</i>.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nInrupt will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nInrupt will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(c) <i>Small Claims Court.\nInfringement</i>.\nEither you or Inrupt may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(d) <i>Waiver of Jury Trial</i>.\nYOU AND INRUPT WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Inrupt are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Inrupt over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND INRUPT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>(e) <i>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</i>.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Inrupt is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<b>&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>(f) <i>Opt-out</i>.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Inrupt Inc., c/o Gunderson Dettmer, One Marina Park Drive, Suite 900, Boston MA 02210&nbsp;postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) <i>Exclusive Venue</i>.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Inrupt to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Inrupt agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Suffolk County, Massachusetts, or the federal district in which that county falls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(h) <i>Severability</i>.\nIf the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Inrupt.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Miscellaneous</i>.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Inrupt may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Inrupt agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Inrupt, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Inrupt, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Inrupt in any respect whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You and Inrupt agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p> &nbsp;Solid<ul>\n<li>About

"To make requests regarding your rights, you can contact inrupt on security@inrupt.com.\nYou have control over your personal data and how it is collected, used, and shared.\nFor example, you have a right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a \"data subject access request\").\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to confirm that we are lawfully processing it.</li>\n<li>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>\n<li>Request erasure of your personal data via&nbsp;https://inrupt.net/account/delete.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nPlease note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>\n<li>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>\n<li>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy.\n(b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nor (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>\n<li>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nPlease note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>\n<li>Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.&nbsp;If you do not want to receive promotional or other e-mail from us, you can remove yourself from our mailing lists.</li>\n<li>Submit a complaint to the supervisory authority for data protection in your country.</li>\n<li>If you are a European national or resident, you have the right to submit a report to your local data protection supervisory authority if you do not get a response from&nbsp;us within 30 days.",
