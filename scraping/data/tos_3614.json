submission\n<p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.</li>\n<li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>\n<li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a

purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties\u2019 terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.</p>\n<p>Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.</p>\nRetention of Product ownership\n<p>Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become the User\u2019s property.</p>\nRetention of usage rights\n<p>Users do not acquire any rights to use

cause service interruptions.</p>\nFixed-term subscriptions\n<p>Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.</p>\n<p>Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible, unless the User renews the subscription by paying the relevant fee.</p>\n<p>Fixed-term subscriptions may not be terminated prematurely and shall run out upon expiration of the subscription term.</p>\nSubscriptions handled via Apple ID\n<p>Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on Yuka.\nWhen doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any payment due shall be charged to their Apple ID account;</li>\n<li>subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;</li>\n<li>any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;</li>\n<li>subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users\u2019 Apple App Store account settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.</p>\nAutomatic renewal\n<p>\n<strong>Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase, unless the User cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination specified in the relevant section of these Terms and/or Yuka.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.</strong>\n</p>\nTermination\n<p>\n<strong>Recurring subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or \u2014 if applicable \u2014 by using the corresponding controls inside Yuka.</strong>\n</p>\nTermination notice\n<p>\n<strong>If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.</strong>\n</p> User rightsRight of withdrawal\n<p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.\nUsers can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>\nWho the right of withdrawal applies to\n<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>\n<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>\nExercising the right of withdrawal\n<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from

intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.\nIn order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>\n<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>\n</ul> Effects of withdrawal\n<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>\n<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User\u2019s decision to withdraw from the contract.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.\nIn any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p> Liability and indemnificationEU UsersIndemnification\n<p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders,

life, health or physical integrity, the Owner shall only be liable to the extent of typical and foreseeable damages at the moment the contract was entered into.</p>\n<p>In particular, within the limits stated above, the Owner shall not be liable for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>any loss of business opportunities and any other loss, even indirect, that may be incurred by the User (such as, but not limited

information with third parties for a business purpose\n<p>We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a third party for business purposes.\nIn this case, we enter a written

located at 14 rue de Turbigo 75001 Paris, France (R.C.S.\nParis no.\n817 769 466)</p>\n<p>Before registering on the Application, each User must carefully read this End User License Agreement (\u201cEULA\u201d) as well as the&nbsp;General Terms and Conditions&nbsp;and the rules regarding the&nbsp;Privacy Policy.\nThe&nbsp;General&nbsp;Terms and Conditions form&nbsp;an&nbsp;integral part&nbsp;of&nbsp;this EULA.</p>\n<p>Use of the Yuka App assumes that the User has accepted this entire EULA, including the General Terms and Conditions.\nSuch acceptance is deemed to be as valid as the User\u2019s handwritten signature.</p>\n<p>The EULA and its appendices are written in French, English and Spanish.\nIn case of divergence of interpretation, only the French version shall prevail.</p>\n<p>Contact email:&nbsp;team@yuka.io</p>Definitions<p>The following terms have the definitions given:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>App</strong>: the application Yuka and all of its pages and screens.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Database</strong>: the database of products used in the App.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Service</strong>: evaluation and recommendation services for food and cosmetic products.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Feature</strong>: the digital content or service that can be purchased or subscribed to through an in-app purchase in the App, corresponding to the \u201cmember\u201d version or \u201cpremium\u201d version.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Publisher</strong>: the artificial or natural person responsible for publishing the App and for its content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User</strong>: the mobile device user using the App.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Client</strong>: refers to the mobile device user purchasing a Feature in the App.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Store</strong>: refers to the online application downloading platform used by the Publisher to publish the App, and used by the User to download the App, namely the Google Play Store and Apple Store.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Score</strong>: refers to the overall score obtained by applying the evaluation method developed by the Publisher.</p>Purpose<p>The main purpose of the App is to inform consumers about the ingredients of commonly sold food and cosmetic products.</p>\n<p>The App offers a scoring and recommendation system that analyzes information provided by the products' makers.</p>\n<p>The App is published by the company Yuca, which is totally&nbsp;independent.\nYuca has no contractual or financial ties of any kind with the producers and or distributors of the products evaluated by the application.</p>Scoring method<p>The&nbsp;food scoring&nbsp;method used by the App includes the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nutritional balance (60%)</li>\n<li>presence of food additives (30%)</li>\n<li>whether the product is organic (10%)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For nutritional balance, the scoring method is based on Nutri-Score, a nutritional quality information system for food products developed by Sant\u00e9 Publique France (www.santepubliquefrance.fr).</p>\n<p>\ufeffFor salt and chocolate, the rating method takes into account additional specific criteria, differentiating from a qualitative or environmental point of view: the extraction or processing method for salt.\nthe cocoa content and type of fat for chocolate.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;cosmetics scoring method is based on analyzing all of the product's ingredients.\nThe application evaluates the level of health risk of the ingredients that make up the products.\nOn the other hand, the application does not evaluate their effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Each ingredient is assigned a science-based risk level.\nFor risk levels have been defined: High (red), moderate (orange), low (yellow), and no risk (green).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Score assigned by the App constitutes an opinion based on the information present on the product.&nbsp;</strong>The terms \u201cexcellent\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cpoor\u201d, and \u201cbad\u201d apply only to the product's Score under the scoring method developed by the Publisher, as shown in the App.\nThe terms \u201chigh risk\u201d, \u201cmoderate risk\u201d, \u201clow risk\u201d, and \u201cno risk\u201d apply only to the Publisher's opinion about the corresponding ingredient based on the scientific sources analyzed.\nThese adjectives do not refer to the product itself or its intrinsic qualities.</p>Premium version<p>The App offers the in-app purchase of a&nbsp;Premium version&nbsp;that includes the following Features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\u201cOffline\u201d</strong> mode: Allows the services offered by the application to be used without an Internet connection.\nThis feature does not cover all of the products referenced in the database, only some of them (the most commonly scanned ones).</li>\n<li>the \u201c<strong>Search\u201d</strong> feature: Allows the User to search the database of referenced products using keywords (product name, brand, etc.), without needing to scan the product to search for it.</li>\n<li>the&nbsp;\u201c<strong>Food Preferences</strong>\u201d feature: Allows the User to customize the app based on their own food preferences.\nThe App highlights unwanted ingredients in the nutritional facts and recommendations that take those preferences into account.</li>\n</ul>Database<p>Yuca does not guarantee that the&nbsp;Database&nbsp;and the exact composition of the analyzed products are totally reliable.</p>\n<p>Yuca does not itself analyze the exact composition of the products.\nThe information provided by the application relays the data provided by the products' makers.\nComposition or detection errors may exist.\nIt is therefore best to check the packaging and&nbsp;report any errors&nbsp;through the App.</p>\n<p>Yuca does not guarantee full detection of the ingredients.\nThis is because the ingredients present on the packaging may differ from those listed in the App or that the detection of those ingredients has failed.\nThe User must therefore always check the packaging to be safe.\nThe App\u2019s features are not medical advice under any circumstances.</p>Account in the AppCreating an account<p>A User who&nbsp;creates an account&nbsp;in the App can access it by logging in using the details provided at the time they register and using systems such as third-party social media login buttons.\nThe User is fully responsible for protecting the password they have chosen.\nThey are encouraged to use complex passwords.\nIf a password is forgotten, they can choose a new one.\nThis password ensures the privacy of the information contained in their account, and the user should therefore refrain from giving or sending it to a third party.\nIf they do not, the App\u2019s Publisher may not be held liable for unauthorized access to the user\u2019s account.</p>Suspending or deleting an account<p>The Publisher reserves the exclusive right to&nbsp;block access&nbsp;to the App or delete the account of any User who violates this EULA (particularly but not limited to when the member has knowingly provided incorrect information in the App) or any account that has been inactive for at least a year.</p>\n<p>Said suspension or deletion shall not be considered damaging the excluded member, who may not claim any compensation for this act.\nThis exclusion does not prevent the Publisher from taking legal action against the User if the facts justify the case.</p>Rights and obligations of the User<p>The User agrees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to only use the data relayed by the App for personal, non-commercial use;</li>\n<li>to not exploit the data, opinions, recommendations, and rankings offered by the App for their personal gain;</li>\n<li>to not make incorrect additions or changes to the composition of the products</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each User is free to close their account on the App.\nTo do so, the member must send an e-mail to the Publisher indicating that they wish to delete their account, or follow the&nbsp;deletion procedure.</p>Adding products<p>The Users have the ability to contribute to content accessible via the App by adding or editing data about food and cosmetic products.\nThe contributor agrees to provide true information when contributing and to follow the contribution rules.\nThe author waives their rights to the content of the contributions, in favor of the Publisher, for any distribution or use, even if commercial in nature.</p>\n<p>Contributors are informed that the Publisher may publish all or some of the contribution in question at the website Open Food Facts (openfoodfacts.org).</p>\n<p>The contributor agrees to relay only information and photographs for which they own the intellectual property rights.\nThe contributor agrees to not add information and/or photographs from other sites.\nThe information added by the contributor must come directly from the product\u2019s packaging.\nPhotographs added by the contributor must have been personally shot by the contributor.</p>Editing products<p>A User who has noticed missing or inaccurate information is invited to add to it by editing the product facts.\nThe User may also report an error to the Publisher, which will then make its best efforts to update the Database.</p>\n<p>Contributors who deliberately delete information and/or insert incorrect information will be prohibited from using and contributing to the service, and legal action may be taken against them.</p>\n<p>The User alone is responsible for the content they publish.\nThe User agrees to follow the laws and regulations in force, as well as the present conditions of use.\nThe Publisher is not required to monitor the content published by the User.</p>Rights and obligations of the PublisherAccess to the App<p>The Publisher hereby informs you that the information entered into the App is hosted on the servers of an outside service provider to which the Publisher subcontracts its hosting.</p>\n<p>The Publisher may not be held liable for technical unavailability of the connection, regardless of whether this is due to an event of force majeure, maintenance, an update, a change, an intervention by the hosting company, an internal or external strike, a network failure, an electrical power outage, or misconfigured settings or misuse of the User\u2019s device.</p>\n<p>The User acknowledges that they are familiar with the limitations and constraints specific to the Internet, and as such recognizes that it is impossible to fully guarantee that data exchanges are secure.\nThe Publisher may not be held liable for damages resulting from the App, such as lost data, intrusion, virus, service breakdowns, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Total or partial inability to use the App and the Features, particularly owing to hardware incompatibility&nbsp;may not give rise to any compensation, indemnification, or holding the Publisher liable, except in the event of a proven hidden defect, non-compliance, or malfunction.\nIf a purchase made in the App is not provided, the User has up to three months (from the date of purchase) to object.\nOnce that period has passed, no complaint will be accepted.</p>Liability<p>The Publisher may not in any event be held liable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for any direct or indirect damages, particularly with regard to lost profits, lost income, lost clients, or lost data that may, inter alia, result from the use of the App, or the inability to use it;</li>\n<li>for a User device malfunction, downtime, misuse, or improperly configured settings, or for the use of an uncommon or obsolete device by the User;</li>\n<li>for the content of links or outside sources accessible by the User from the App;</li>\n<li>for the content of the information related to the composition of the analyzed products (food or cosmetics) and the evaluations, analyses, recommendations, or opinions related to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The User recognizes that the Publisher may not be held liable for the provision of data about the analyzed products, and may not be held liable for their content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The User expressly agrees that it is using the App at its own risk and under its own responsibility alone.&nbsp;</strong>The App provides the User with information as an example.\nThe Publisher does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or exhaustiveness of the information and data found in the App.\nThe Database changes, particularly when products are added and/or edited by the User and Publisher.&nbsp.\nThe User alone is responsible for choosing a purchasing a Feature.</p>\n<p>The Publisher may not be held liable for errors in the Database, particularly with respect to information about product analysis.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>It is therefore up to the User to verify the composition of the products directly on their packaging in order to be sure they are obtaining up-to-date information about their composition.</p>\n<p>The Publisher cannot guarantee the usefulness of the App\u2019s information and recommendations.\nThe App is not in any event a substitute for consulting with a health professional, such as a dietician or a doctor.\nThe information and recommendations may contain errors and must not in any event be used for medical purposes.</p>\n<p>Hyperlinks relayed on the App may redirect to other applications or websites, and the Publisher of the App may not be held liable if the content of those applications and sites violate the law.\nLikewise, the Publisher may not be held liable if the use of those applications or sites by the user causes it any harm.</p>Intellectual property rights<p>The exclusive use of the&nbsp;Yuka brand, logos, software, analysis methods, recommendation methods, graphical elements, databases, and more generally, all content offered by the App is reserved for the benefit of the Publisher, or potentially its partners.\nAnyone who communicates, represents, reproduces, embeds, distributes, or redistributes them may face penalties as provided in particular in the Intellectual Property Code, Civil Code, and Commerce Code of France.</p>\n<p>Any member who violates the protected items in this way may have their account deleted without prior notice or compensation, and without that deletion constituting damages, without prejudice to potential subsequent legal proceedings against them, at the initiative of the Publisher of the App or its agent.</p>Applicable law, mediation, and competent judge<p>This EULA is subject to French law.\nThe Publisher reserves the right to edit it at any time.</p>\n<p>Any disputes that may arise in the performance of these terms and conditions shall be settled as a priority by amicable means.\nIf no amicable resolution can be reached, the parties, whether consumers or professionals, are bound to enlist a mediator prior to entering legal proceedings.</p>\n<p>If no agreement can be reached by the parties, the Tribunal Judiciaire of Paris (France) alone has jurisdiction to settle the dispute.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legal Notice</em>\n</p> How
