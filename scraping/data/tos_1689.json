processing.</li>\n<li>Where personal information is subjected to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.\nThis

through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p>\nRight to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds\n<em>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding objections to processing your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</em>\n<p>Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process personal information, you have the right to object to that processing.\nIf you object, we must stop that processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.\nWhere we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>If you want to object to the processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p>\nRight to be

outside of the European Economic Area.\nFor transfers to countries without an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Algolia puts appropriate safeguards through contractual obligations.</p>\nRight to Withdraw Consent\n<em>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for

Algolia remove the personal information, we will refer your request to the applicable subscriber and we will respond to the request within 30 days.</p>\nSubscriber Data Retention\n<p>Algolia retains
