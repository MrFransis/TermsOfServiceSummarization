Terms of Use remain\napplicable to that Content.</p>\n<p>To further clarify the terms we are using, please refer to the glossary at the\nend of this document.\nPlease reach out to us via our contact details below as\nsoon as possible if you or anyone in your company using CodeSandbox feels\nuninformed, finds anything on our websites to be unfair, incompletely explained\nor surprising.</p> 1.\nAccount\n<ol>\n<li>When you create an Account with us, you must provide us information that is\ntrue, accurate, complete and current at all times.\nPlease update your\ninformation if anything changes.\nFailure to do so constitutes a breach of\nthe Terms, which may result in termination of your Account on our Service.</li>\n<li>You can create a CodeSandbox Account via a third-party service.\nIn order to\nprotect yourself, us and our other users, please make sure that you keep\nthese third-party service accounts secure.</li>\n<li>You agree not to let any third party use your Account.\nYou must notify us\nimmediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized\nuse of your Account.\nOur contact details are at the end of this document.</li>\n</ol> 2.\nIntellectual Property: Ownership\n<ol>\n<li>Content that you create remains Your Content.\nThis means that by using our\nplatform no intellectual property rights are transferred from you to us.</li>\n<li>It is your responsibility to make sure that Your Content does not infringe\nintellectual property rights of any other party.\nThis means that if you use\nContent that you have not created from scratch yourself, you need to make\nsure that you have sufficient permission to use this Content.\nYou usually\nneed (i) a license to use another party\u2019s content or work and (ii) if you\nhave obtained a license or an open source license applies to the relevant\ncontent: You need to comply with the terms and conditions of that license.</li>\n<li>If we are held liable for infringement of third party intellectual property\nrights as a result of your actions or omissions, you shall indemnify us and\nhold us harmless.\nThis means that you will have to pay all our damages\nincluding legal fees.</li>\n</ol> 3.\nIntellectual property: License\n<ol>\n<li>Public Sandboxes that existed prior to the effective date of these Terms\n&nbsp;are MIT licensed by default, these Terms becoming applicable do not change\nthat situation.</li>\n<li>As of the effective date of these Terms, Sandboxes are public by default,\nbut it is up to you to define the license terms for Sandboxes you have\ncontrol over.\nThere is however an important condition here: If you have a\npublic Sandbox, you give permission to other Users to fork (read: copy) Your\nSandbox.\nSimilarly, you are allowed to fork public Sandboxes of other Users.\nThis means that if you choose certain license terms for your public Sandbox,\nthese license terms have to allow for forking.\nBasically, this means open\nsource licensing, and you decide the type of open source license.</li>\n<li>You also permit us to use Your Content for promotional activities.\nRest\nassured that all of our users have to comply with these Terms of Use and\nthat none of our users are allowed to use any content to break the law or\ncause you, us or any other user damage.</li>\n<li>You can control visibility and forking permissions of a Sandbox by opting\nfor one of our plans.\nFor private or unlisted Sandboxes &nbsp;it is up to you to\ndefine license terms.\nOther Users do not have permission to fork Sandboxes\ncontrolled by you.</li>\n<li>Your right to control visibility and forking permissions (see above) can be\nused at any time, meaning that you can switch to one of our plans whenever\nyou want to.\nThere is something important to bear in mind though: Any\nContent may have been forked when public and thus be used by third parties.\nUndoing is not an option or a right, nor would it be possible to forbid such\nthird parties from further use of that Content.\nSo only (new/adjusted)\nContent that you create after you switch to a private or unlisted Sandbox\ncan be controlled by you in terms of visibility and forking permissions.\n&nbsp;Please be aware you can switch default visibility mode for Sandboxes on our\nWebsite.</li>\n<li>In any case, you grant us and our legal successors the right to store,\narchive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as\nnecessary to provide our services, including improving our services over\ntime.\nThis license includes the right to copy Your Content to our servers\nand/or databases and make backups.\nparse it into a search index or otherwise\nanalyze it on our servers.</li>\n</ol> 4.\nIntellectual Property: Third-Party Links and Services\n<ol>\n<li>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are\nnot owned or controlled by us.</li>\n<li>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content,\nprivacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services.\nYou\nfurther acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible or liable,\ndirectly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be\ncaused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content,\ngoods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</li>\n<li>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies\nof any third-party web sites or services that you visit.</li>\n</ol> 5.\nSubscriptions: Pricing and Payment\n<ol>\n<li>Some parts of the Service are only available to you if you have a\nCodeSandbox Account.\nAn overview of our subscription plans pricing are\navailable at https://codesandbox.io/pricing.\nYou must create an Account to\npurchase one of our plans.</li>\n<li>We use various payment service providers, depending on your subscription\nplan.\nFor new plans from the effective date of these Terms, the order\nprocess is conducted by our partner and merchant of record paddle.com.\nThis\nmeans Paddle provides all customer service inquiries, handles returns and\nprovides you invoices.\nFor legacy plans, we use our partner Stripe.com who\nprovides invoices.\nYou pay the invoices from our partners directly to them.</li>\n<li>With respect to payment of your subscription plan, when prompted, you will\nhave to comply with the payment terms of the relevant payment service\nprovider.\nIf no such payment terms have been agreed upon, the following\nconditions on pricing and payment shall apply:</li>\n<li>You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (\"Billing\nCycle\").\nBilling cycles depend on your choice: you may choose either a\nmonthly or an annual cycle.</li>\n<li>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your subscription plan will automatically\nrenew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or CodeSandbox\ncancels it.\nYou may cancel your subscription renewal either through your\nonline account management page or by contacting us via the details below.</li>\n<li>CodeSandbox, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the pricing\nfor subscription plans.\nAny change in pricing will become effective at the\nend of the then-current Billing Cycle.</li>\n<li>CodeSandbox will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in\npricing to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before\nsuch change becomes effective.\nSo if you do not agree with proposed pricing\nchanges, it is up to you to terminate your subscription per the end of the\nthen current Billing Cycle.</li>\n<li>Your continued use of the Service offered on the basis of your applicable\nsubscription plan after changes in pricing come into effect constitutes your\nagreement to pay the modified prices for your subscription plan if\napplicable.</li>\n<li>We may suspend the Service based on your subscription plan to you if you do\nnot pay your invoice(s) timely.</li>\n<li>If you are a consumer and purchase one of our subscription plans you have\nthe right to dissolve the agreement within 14 days after conclusion of the\nagreement.\nFor convenience, this right is also explained in our FAQ.</li>\n</ol> 6.\nAcceptable Use, Abuse and Misuse: What not to do or

versions of our Privacy Policy.Privacy Policy\n<p>This privacy policy allows you to learn about the way CodeSandbox B.V.\n(\u201cCodeSandbox\u201d) controls and processes data about you or data that may allow\nanyone with access, to identify you or anyone on your team with a CodeSandbox\naccount as a natural person.\nAdditionally, the types of data we collect and how\nwe use, share and secure this data and how you can exercise your privacy rights\nare outlined.</p>\n<p>The term privacy may typically be associated with privacy settings controlling\nvisibility of user created content such as sandboxes.\nAlthough addressed, this\nmeaning of privacy will only be secondary to the main purposes just described.</p>\n<p>This policy is further intended to apply to anyone exposed to any CodeSandbox\nservice.\nTo further clarify the terms we are using and how we are thinking,\nplease refer to the glossary at the end of this document.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to us via our contact details below as soon as possible if you\nor anyone in your company using CodeSandbox feels uninformed, finds anything on\nour websites to be unfair, incompletely explained or surprising.</p> In short\n<p>We want to be as open as possible about how we treat your personal data, how you\nshould be able to access and control your data and how you can use our services.\nWe will not sell, rent or lease your personal data to anyone, except in case we\nsell&nbsp;our business or part thereof to another company.</p>\n<p>A few take-home points are good to keep in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anything you create using our services is public by default unless you opt to\ngo private;</li>\n<li>We collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary to provide our\nservices, unless you chose to provide more voluntarily;</li>\n<li>We make use of analytical tools on our websites and services to learn whether\nusers are using specific features we release, such as the Template Universe or\nNetlify deploy option and to improve what we are building by way of placing\ntracking cookies;</li>\n<li>We may promote our services to inform you via email about new releases,\ncommunity activities or for events that may ultimately affect your day-to-day\nuse of our services;</li>\n<li>We may enrich your (personal) data with publicly accessible data;</li>\n<li>We are operationally based in The Netherlands and therefore you are dealing\nwith applicable Dutch and/or EU law.</li>\n</ul> What does CodeSandbox collect and why?\n<p>Personal data is collected via various sources on anyone exposed to any\nCodeSandbox service.\nTypically, users who create an account (as defined below)\ncould provide more data.\nFor examples, see the data types section below.\nYou can\nlimit or change the amount of personal data we process and store by limiting the\ndata you provide to us in your account settings or by reaching out to us.</p>\nWhy we are collecting data\n<p>Processing of personal data may be deemed necessary or reasonable when we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Want to act in our legitimate interest as long as it does not override your\nfundamental rights and interests.\nAn example of legitimate interest may be us\nconducting common business operations such as sending you promotional material\nvia email when you have paid for our services.</li>\n<li>Have to perform our agreement in delivering the service described in this\nprivacy document and in more detail in our\nterms of service;</li>\n<li>Have to comply with legal obligations.</li>\n<li>Have your explicit consent to process personal data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amongst other examples mentioned throughout this document, we collect and use\nsuch data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create your account and to provide you with our services;</li>\n<li>Process transactions and sending invoices;</li>\n<li>Contact you with requested support;</li>\n<li>Send you documentation, educational material related to our services;</li>\n<li>Notify you of major upcoming product or legal policy changes;</li>\n<li>Improve, research and develop new features as part of the services you may be\nusing;</li>\n<li>Invite you to participate in surveys, where necessary subject to your consent;</li>\n<li>Prevent misuse of or stop other illegal activities from being conducted\nthrough our services.</li>\n</ul>\nData types we are collecting and using\n<p>Account basics.\nWhen you create an account, you are asked permission to\nauthorize GitHub to share personal data with CodeSandbox.\nIf available from\nGitHub, we collect and store: avatar, name, first name, last name, bio, email\nand username and -id.\nPlease note that most of this information is already\npublicly available via GitHub's API.</p>\n<p>Access Logs.\nOur servers keep log files, writing and storing personal data such\nas IP address and the type of browser you are using.</p>\n<p>Cookies.\nCodeSandbox uses tracking, functional and analytical cookies because it\nenables many convenient features that may save you some time.\nWe use tracking\ncookies to gather a unique view count of sandboxes and to match a sandbox to\nusers without an account.\nWe allow some of our service providers such as Google\nAnalytics, Amplitude, Algolia and Vero to store cookies on your device.\nWe\nassume you know what cookies are and how to prevent third parties from\ninstalling cookies on your device.\nIf not, your browser settings allow you to\ndisable cookies and control acceptance levels.\nPlease reach out to us via\ndetails below if you are in doubt or seek assistance in understanding and\nchanging browser settings.</p>\n<p>Tracking.\nWe track user behavior and register events such as whether a user has\ncreated a template or interacted with an embed to measure the effectiveness of\nour work and to learn about user choices and preferences in order to improve the\nways we present CodeSandbox.\nIt can also be used to measure whether and when\npeople return to our website, also known as user retention expressed in time.</p>\n<p>Support.\nWhen you reach out to us via one of our support channels, we may opt to\nmaintain records related to your request, including any data, information or\ncontent provided by you or anyone on your team for training purposes of our\nproduct and support team members.\nWe might thus collect personal data such as\nyour browser type and specific setup, disclosed in your emails.\nWe shall not\npublish your name and email when you reach out to us.\nThis is different when you\npost on a more public medium.</p>\n<p>Marketing.\nWe may use any combination of services in order to enhance what we\nknow about you for the sole purpose of providing tips on how to use CodeSandbox,\nwhich can be opted out of at any point in time by reaching out to us or clicking\nthe unsubscribe at the bottom of every email you may receive from us.\nFor\ninstance, we may have learned you have attempted to complete a certain action\ntwice: When we have your email, we may send you an email via one of our service\nproviders with related tips.</p>\n<p>Financial.\nWe use Stripe as a payment service provider and do not collect nor\nstore credit card or other financial data in our databases.\nWe do have access to\nStripe's database for the purpose of complying with support requests and\nadministration requirements, but no level of access exposes full credit card\ndetails.\nOnly the last four digits can be read and are typically used for\nverification purposes during support interactions.</p>\nUse of third parties, sharing data and sub-processors\n<p>We use third party service providers to deliver to us what we have chosen not to\ndevelop ourselves.\nAs many of them provide vital functions in the CodeSandbox\ninfrastructure such as hosting or analytics, we refer to them as partners or\nsub-processors.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, all personal data we collect and share with our partners is\npseudonymized or tokenized, unless we use that partner to communicate with you\nor your team, for which typically an email address has to be known to that\npartner.\nIf a partner does not need to know an email address for example, we do\nnot share.\nAn additional exception for which we are likely to use e-mail\naddresses is when we want to attain more publicly available data on you or your\nteam: We would have to send a partner at least one type of personal data unique\nenough to generate matching results about you or your teams' online identity.</p>\n<p>A complicated aspect of being on the modern web is increasing entanglement: A\nunified and consistent user interface of a single website may \u2013 unbeknownst to\nits user \u2013 contain dozens of services from an equal amount of different\ncompanies, each with their own handling of data and privacy policies.\nAs a data\ncontroller CodeSandbox is fully responsible for what it can control: The choice\nof its partners and the orders we send to them and to attain what we need to\nserve you and are in accordance with this policy.</p>\n<p>As part of our checkout flow, our Stripe integration can be considered a clear\nexample of how hard it can be to discern who is delivering what service to you.\nIntuitive design has to be obfuscating in this regard and can ignite distrust in\nsome, pleasant surprise in others.</p>\n<p>We have certain practices in place to ensure our partners adhere to legal\nstandards and we typically interview new partners to get a sense of how they are\ntreating user data.\nWe have Data Processing Agreements in place with our\npartners and our sub-processors.</p>\nSub-processors &amp.\nData locations\n<p>Syntax: (Company Name (\u201ca.k.a.\u201d), Location, Purpose,
