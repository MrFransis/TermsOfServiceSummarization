Privacy Notice changes?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>CARU's COPPA Safe Harbor Program</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat types of information do we collect about kids?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our guests can use some of our Services, view content, and\nenjoy many features without registering for an account or our collection of any\npersonal information subject to COPPA.</p>\n<p>If a user has indicated that they are a kid when trying to\ncreate a Pok\u00e9mon account, we will collect a parent's email address and obtain\nverifiable parental consent before allowing the kid to provide any additional\npersonal information.\nSee below to learn how we seek parental consent.</p>\n<p>Once we obtain parental consent, a kid can use our services\nmuch like any other user.\nAnd we may collect from the kid the same types of\npersonal information, and use and share that information for the same purposes,\nas described in the general Privacy Notice with the exception that Pok\u00e9mon does\nnot, nor does it allow third parties to, collect kids' personal data (including\npersistent identifiers) for behavioral advertising, amassing a profile, or any purpose\nother than to support its internal operations unless we have obtained explicit\nprior parental consent.</p>\n<p>We receive information from our guests directly and from\nthird parties such as Play! Pok\u00e9mon Tournament Organizers.\nWe collect personal\ninformation from parents on behalf of their kids to create an account for\nPok\u00e9mon's Services.</p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon does not condition participation in any of its\nServices for kids on the collection of more personal information than is\nreasonably necessary.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nHow do we use and share the personal information that we collect from kids?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As noted above, once we obtain parental consent, a kid can\nuse our Services much like any other user.\nAnd we may collect from the kid the\nsame types of personal information, and use and share that information for the\nsame purposes, as described in the general Privacy Notice, unless otherwise\nspecified in this Supplemental Kids' Privacy Notice.\nFor example, once a parent\nhas provided consent to create an account, a kid can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Link an account from one of Pok\u00e9mon's Services with an account from another Service operated by Pok\u00e9mon or an affiliate of Pok\u00e9mon</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in games, reward programs, contests, sweepstakes, events, or promotions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Send us questions or correspond with us via email or our customer support portal concerning the Services or the kid's participation in organized events</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in polls, surveys, or questionnaires</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use our Email-a-Friend feature and participate in \u201ccanned chat,\u201d where a kid can select words from a list prepared by Pok\u00e9mon to send messages to other website users</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable push notifications (you can turn push notification on or off by modifying the settings within the applicable Service, or within your device's settings)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that some Services may enable a\nkid to publicly disclose personal information and/or communicate with other users.\nWe do not have control over third parties (e.g., other users) who may have\ncopied or reposted publicly posted information.</p>\n<p>Until we receive verifiable parental consent, the parent's\ncontact information gathered from a kid is used only to obtain the parent's\nconsent for our information collection practices.</p>\n<p>With parental consent, we may also use a kid's contact\ninformation to send the kid emails and messages with promotional information\nabout new products and features, special offers, contests, and sweepstakes, as\nwell as other interesting information concerning new products, events, and\nupdates about Pok\u00e9mon.\nParents can always choose whether their kid may receive\nthese promotional messages by visiting their account profile settings or\ncontacting us.</p>\n<p>If a kid wins a prize from a sweepstakes, contest, or other\npromotional event, we will notify the parent at the parent's email address and\nrequest that the parent provide their postal address for the purpose of\ndelivering the prize.\nWith the appropriate consent, we may publish a winner's\nfirst name, city, state of residence, and country/region.</p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon shares kids' personal information with the same\nentities and for the same purposes described in the general Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>Also, if a parent chooses to allow a kid to participate in\nthe Play! Pok\u00e9mon tournament ratings and rankings portion of our websites, we\nwill use personal information about the kid to track the kid's tournament\nresults, player ranking, rating, player status (e.g., active, terminated,\nwinner, etc.).\nA parent can choose to post a kid's screen name, full name, or\nfirst name and last initial in the player rankings.\nWe will also share the\nkid's personal information with independent third parties (such as League\nLeaders and Tournament Organizers) so they can run offline Play! Pok\u00e9mon events\nthat the kid may participate in.\nIf a parent doesn't want their kid's personal\ninformation shared with independent third parties who run Play! Pok\u00e9mon events,\nthen they should not allow their kid to participate in the Play! Pok\u00e9mon\ntournament ratings and rankings portion of our websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nHow do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their kids?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When a kid seeks to register with our Services, we will\nemail their parent.\nThis email notifies the parent that their kid wishes to\nregister, and it asks the parent to create an account to grant consent for\ntheir kid to register.\nIf the parent ignores or refuses to register their kid,\nwe will delete the kid and parent's contact information within 14 days of such\nnotice.\nIf the parent permits the registration, we will grant the kid access to\nthe features described in the email and this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>To help verify that the parent is the person providing\nconsent, Pok\u00e9mon (in the US in conjunction with Veratad, a leading age and\nidentity verification company) asks for the sum of the first and last digit of\nthe parent's Social Security number, as well as other pieces of information to\nverify the parent's identity, such as name, birth date, and physical address.\nNote that Pok\u00e9mon does NOT store this information anywhere in our records.</p>\n<p>Parents can revoke consent at any time by contacting our\ncustomer service department and submitting a request on the https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406 website or emailing privacyquestions@pokemon.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nHow can parents access, change, or delete personal information about their kids?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At any time, a parent can log into their Pok\u00e9mon Trainer\nClub account to access their \u201cEdit Profile\u201d section or contact our customer\nservice department to access or change the personal information in their kid's\naccount.</p>\n<p>A parent may delete the personal information that we have\ncollected from their kid by submitting a request on the https://support.pokemon.com/hc/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000012406\nwebsite or emailing privacyquestions@pokemon.com.\nThe parent should include their kid's username and the parent's email address\nin the email so that we can better assist with the inquiry or request.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nHow will we notify parents if our Kids' Privacy Notice changes?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may amend our Kids' Privacy Notice at any time.\nwhen we\ndo so, we will change the last updated date.\nWe will notify parents of any\nmaterial changes in the way we intend to process kids' personal information.\nWe\nwill apply material changes to our Kids' Privacy Notice only when the changes\nare in compliance with applicable law, including any parental consent\nrequirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nCARU's COPPA Safe Harbor Program</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Pok\u00e9mon is a licensee of CARU's COPPA Safe Harbor Program.\nIf you believe that we have not
