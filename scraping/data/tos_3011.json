Notice<p>This supplemental privacy notice gives European Union (EU) and Brazilian residents additional information required by local law.\nThese provisions, together with the statements in the College

of cookies for nonessential website purposes.\nWhen you visit our website and with your consent, we place cookies on your computer.\nPlease see the sections above regarding cookies and similar technologies.</p>\n<p>This EU and Brazil Privacy Notice explains why we collect your personally identifiable information and how we process it.\nWhen necessary we collect and process your information per the lawful bases described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To fulfill a contract with you, for instance to provide a College Board test or a test offered by another company on behalf of College Board.</li>\n<li>We may provide personally identifiable information to our subcontractors (processors) and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our written instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Statement and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\nFor example, we use service providers to help process and score our tests.</li>\n<li>To process a payment, to create an account on our website, and for website management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also process your personally identifiable information with your consent to send you marketing email communications, enroll you in Student Search Service, or send your scores to your designated recipients.</p>\n<p>We may also process your personally identifiable information for the purposes of our legitimate interests, if processing it doesn\u2019t outweigh your rights and freedoms.\nWe may process your personal information as needed to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protect you, us, or others from threats (such as test security, security threats, or test fraud)</li>\n<li>Improve College Board tests and support College Board research initiatives</li>\n<li>Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service</li>\n<li>Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions</li>\n<li>Understand and improve our business, improve

Profiling:</strong> College Board may use automated processes in connection with scoring tests and for similar purposes, as needed to provide the test services you have requested, and for fraud prevention related to test security.\nAll of these decisions are subject to human review.\nWe will not make automated decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless (a) the decision is necessary as part of a contract we have with you, (b) we have your explicit consent, or (c) we\u2019re required by law to use the technology.\nYou can learn more about test scoring by reading the information posted on our website about each of our tests.\nYou can learn more about test security by reading the information posted on our website.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we use certain elements of personal data for College Board research.\nFor example, we may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions.\nOur research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias.\nThey also aim to improve teaching, learning, and assessment.\nOur research results do not contain any identifiable data and aren\u2019t used to target or profile individuals.\nVisit our website to learn more: Research.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your

us to update it.</li>\n<li>You have the right to object to our processing of your personally identifiable information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also ask us to delete or restrict your personally identifiable information, including a copy of your information related to your right to data portability.</p>\n<p>To exercise these rights, please contact us via email at DataProtectionInquiry@collegeboard.org or write to us at the U.S.\naddress below, and our Customer Service team will assist you (we may need to verify your identity before we can process your request).\nOur ability to delete personal information will be limited when we\u2019re required to retain records, as in connection with score reports and test security processes.</p>\n<p>If you believe we have processed your personally identifiable information in violation of applicable law, you can file a complaint with the College Board Chief Privacy Officer or a supervisory authority by emailing privacy@collegeboard.org.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll retain your personally identifiable information for as long as the information is needed for the purposes detailed above and for any additional period that may be required or permitted by law.\nYou may request that we delete your personally identifiable information by emailing us at DataProtectionInquiry@collegeboard.org.\nUnless we\u2019re required by law to retain your information or have a legitimate interest in retaining it, we\u2019ll delete it within 30 days of your request.\nIf you ask us to delete your data, you won\u2019t be able to access any College Board account or test scores, or send test scores to any colleges, universities, or any other third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>International Users</strong>\n</p>\n<p>College Board, its website, and its website servers are located and operated in the United States, requiring your information to be
