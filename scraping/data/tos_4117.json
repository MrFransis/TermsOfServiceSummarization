89126</p>\n<p>ReviewMeta.com@Gmail.com</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy explains how this Site treats \u201cpersonal information\u201d that we gather from visitors and how we use it.\nPlease, also read our Terms of Use for better understanding of Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\u201cPersonal Information\u201d is information that is personally identifiable like a name, e-mail address, or other information that we can reasonably link to such information.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>What We Gather and How We Do It</u>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Nonpersonally Identifiable Information.\nOur primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</li>\n<li>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.\nWhen you engage in certain activities on this site, such as registering for a membership, ordering a product or service, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums or other public areas, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.\nIt is completely optional for you to engage in these activities, elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, and other personal identifying information.\nWhen ordering products or services on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number.\nDepending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary.\nIf you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</li>\n<li>Nonpersonally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.\nWe gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways.\nThis information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.\nThis information may include the Web site\u2019s Uniform Resource Locator (\u201cURL\u201d) that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address.\nA URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.\nAn IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (\u201cTCP/IP\u201d) network, such as the World Wide Web.\nNetworks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.\nIn other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.\nComputers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.</li>\n<li>Our Web server automatically collects information from a visitor\u2019s computer and browser, including their internet protocol (IP) address and cookies.\nA cookie is a small text file that is sent to your Web browser from a Web server and stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive.\nWhen you visit this Site, a cookie may be sent to your computer.\nYou can control whether or not you want to accept cookies by adjusting the settings of your browser.</li>\n<li>Third party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on prior visits to this website.\nNo personal information is collected by these cookies.\nYou can opt out of third party vendor\u2019s cookies at any time by visiting this page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</li>\n<li>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.\nYou provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you: (a) register for our services and register your email address with us.\n(b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us or one of our partners.\n(c) sign up for special offers from selected third parties.\n(d) send email messages, submit forms or transmit other information by telephone or letter.\nor (e) submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our site.\nWe may also collect information from you at other points on our site that state that such information is being collected.</li>\n<li>Our site uses Google Analytics to help us gather and analyze traffic to our site.&nbsp.\nYou can read more about the Google Analytics data policies here.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>How We Use the Information We Gather</u>\n<ul>\n<li>We do not distribute or sell your personal information.\nWe do not send you advertisements and we do not share your email address with anyone.</li>\n<li>We may use the personal information that visitors provide us to respond to correspondence, contact them regarding their membership account, improve the content of our Site, and for informational or other developmental purposes.</li>\n<li>If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will send you a weekly email, and not share your information with anyone else.\nYou may unsubscribe from the newsletter anytime you want.</li>\n<li>When you post a review, all the information you submit is displayed for anyone to read.\nThis may include the bio that you submit, your username, comments, age, location, or any other information that you input into our system.\nWe will not share your date of birth, email address or password with anyone.\nThose are all items which we will never publicly display.</li>\n<li>We may use the information collected by our Web servers to analyze traffic patterns, record session information, store visitors\u2019 preferences and identify sources of web traffic to the Site.</li>\n<li>We may also use the information we collect to investigate, prevent or take action against suspected illegal activities, problems with this Site, or as required by law.\nWe may use the information for legal proceedings, such as responding to subpoenas, court orders, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.\nIn the event that our company or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, the information collected by our Site may be one of the assets transferred.</li>\n<li>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities.\nWe will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.\nWe fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities.\nWe reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</li>\n<li>We may also provide Nonpersonally Identifiable Information about our customers\u2019 sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Sites Not Covered by this Policy</u>.\nExcept as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document

Use.\nThis Site is not directed to, nor does it knowingly collect any personal information from children under 18.\nIf a child who we know to be under age 18 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents or seek parental consent.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Opt Out Rights</u>.\nBy using this website you agree to the terms of this
