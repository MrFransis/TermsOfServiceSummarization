Waiver.\nWaiver of Trial by Jury.<p>\n<em>Please read this Section (\u201c<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>\u201d) carefully.\nIt is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.\nIt contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong>&nbsp.\nAll claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong>&nbsp.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision.&nbsp.\nArbitration shall be initiated through <strong>JAMS, Inc.</strong> (formerly Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201c<strong>ADR Provider</strong>\u201d) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.&nbsp.\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.&nbsp.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms (\u201cArbitration Rules\u201d).&nbsp.\nThe JAMS rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.&nbsp.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.&nbsp.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.&nbsp.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States (in which case hearing will be held in the capital of your country), and unless the parties agree otherwise.&nbsp.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp.\nIf non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong>&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.&nbsp.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong>&nbsp.\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, or under paragraph 11 of this Arbitration Agreement, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong>&nbsp.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp.\nIn the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in Santa Clara County, California.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Confidentiality.</strong>&nbsp.\nNo part of the procedures shall be open to the public or the media.&nbsp.\nAll evidence discovered or submitted at the hearing is confidential and may not be disclosed, except by written agreement of the parties, pursuant to court order or unless required by law.&nbsp.\nThis Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Arbitration Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Severability.</strong>&nbsp.\nIf any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong>&nbsp.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Small Claims Court.</strong>&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Courts.</strong>&nbsp.\nIn any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, for such purpose.</li>\n</ul>B.&nbsp.\nGoverning Law<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may require the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>C.&nbsp.\nModifications to Terms<p>We may change these Terms from time to time.&nbsp.\nAny such changes will become effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site.&nbsp.\nThese changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site or Services.&nbsp.\nIf you object to any such changes, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Site and the Services (including

features, or any part thereof, you agree to be bound by the additional terms of use applicable to such features.&nbsp.\nIn the event that any of the additional terms of use governing such area conflict with these Terms, the additional terms will govern.</p>D.&nbsp.\nModifications to Services.<p>We reserve the right to modify the Site and/or Services at any time without notice.&nbsp.\nIf you object to any changes to the Site or Services, your sole recourse will be to cease using the Site and Service, terminate your Subscription for a pro-rata refund of any amounts you have pre-paid for the Subscription (if any), or not renew the Subscription (if applicable).&nbsp.\nContinued use of the Site or Services following posting of any such changes will indicate your acknowledgement of such

any third-party should we exercise our right to modify or discontinue the Site or the Services, except and if otherwise expressly set forth in Section V.</p>E.&nbsp.\nGeneral Terms<p>You agree to comply with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your use of the Site, the Services (including the Downloadable Tools) and the Products.&nbsp.\nAny delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions reflected in the invalid provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.&nbsp.\nThe section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nThe word including means including without limitation.&nbsp.\nThese Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with regard to the matters described above.&nbsp.\nThese Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.</p>\n<p>Contact

services of various kinds (the \"Services\").&nbsp.\nThis privacy policy describes our information collection and use practices in connection with our Site and Service, as well as circumstances under which we disclose information collected from you.&nbsp.\nOur commitment to you is that we will not use or disclose information collected from you other than as described in this policy.</p>\n<p>In order to access and use the Site and Services, you must agree to our Online Terms and Conditions (the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d) posted on the Site.&nbsp.\nPersons and organizations with permission to use the Service are considered \u201cRegistered Users.\u201d&nbsp.\nYou may view portions of the Site even if you are not an Registered User of the Service.&nbsp.\nThis privacy policy applies to Company\u2019s collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information (defined below) from Registered Users of the Site, as well as from persons who merely visit the Site.&nbsp.\nCompany has adopted and implemented this privacy policy as part of our commitment to protecting your personal information from misuse.</p>\n<p>By submitting Personal Information through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>Your Personal Information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>What Information Do We Collect?<p>\u201cPersonal Information\u201d means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.&nbsp.\n\u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.\nNon-Personal Information does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.&nbsp.\nWe collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, as described below.</p>\n<p>Company collects Personal Information as required to offer Services, as listed in the Terms and Conditions, as voluntarily provided by you in the course of correspondence or registration, and as otherwise identified below.&nbsp.\nIn addition, we collect certain information which cannot be used to personally identify any user, such as anonymous, aggregate or statistical data.</p>\n<p>In order to use some Services, you may be required to complete the applicable registration form accessible on the Site.&nbsp.\nAll persons who register are referred to as \u201cRegistered Users.\u201d&nbsp.\nSome Services may not require registration.&nbsp.\nCompany collects and maintains a record of all data provided through such registration forms, e.g.\nyour name, e-mail, mailing addresses, and password and information about your child, e.g., your child\u2019s name, birthday, interests, and gender.\nFor example, individual users who desire to order a Product (as defined in the Terms and Conditions) must provide certain contact information, shipping information, billing information, and financial information (e.g., a credit card number and expiration date) (which will be collected by us or our third party payment processing service providers).</p>\n<p>For some Services, each Registered User may be provided a unique username and password that enable access to the Service.\nWe may track the use of those usernames and passwords in order to collect and maintain records of individual transactions conducted through the Services by Registered Users, and those records may be associated with each Registered User\u2019s individual account profile within the Company system.</p>\n<p>We also collect other types of Personal Information that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support.</p>\n<p>We also collect and maintain records of information that you voluntarily provide to us.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may ask you to participate in a survey, and may ask you to provide Personal Information, such as age, gender or other demographic data.&nbsp.\nIf you enter into a contest or promotion on our Site, we will collect the information your provide to participate in the contest or promotion.&nbsp.\nIf you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.&nbsp.\nWhen you post messages on the message boards of our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.&nbsp.\nHowever, unless such information is necessary for the Service or required by the Terms and Conditions, we do not require you to provide such information to us.</p>\n<p>We collect additional information through the Site and the Service that is not associated with any online account or registration information, and that cannot be used to personally identify you.&nbsp.\nNon-Personal Information ordinarily includes aggregate, summary, or other anonymous data, and may include, by way of example, statistics regarding popularity of particular pages within the Site, or information regarding types of Internet browsers used by Registered Users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\u201cCookies\u201d are small files placed on a user\u2019s computer by a Web site in order to facilitate use of that Web site.&nbsp.\nFor example, a cookie may contain information about a user\u2019s preferences, so that the Web site automatically complies with those preferences whenever the user visits that Web site.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWhen using the Service, we may create \u201ccookies\u201d on your computer for purposes of facilitating and maintaining your current user session, and may collect Personal Information using those cookies in order to enable Company to identify you in connection with the Service and to track use of the Service for purposes consistent with this policy.\nTo make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</p>\n<p>The Site is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services.&nbsp.\nProtecting the privacy of children is very important to us.&nbsp.\nWe do not collect or maintain Personal Information from people we actually know are under 18, and no part of our Site or Service is designed to attract people under 18.&nbsp.\nIf we later learn that a user is under 18, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Service.</p>\n<p>If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, we will collect your and the third party\u2019s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party.&nbsp.\nYou or the third party may contact us at https://www.kiwico.com/contact-ushttps://www.kiwico.com/contact-us to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>Use and Disclosure of Collected Information<p>Company uses information collected from the Site and Service in several ways, as outlined in this policy.&nbsp.\nFor example, we use Personal Information as needed to provide Site and Services, to create Accounts, and to communicate with Registered Users.&nbsp.\nWe also use both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information when evaluating ways to improve the Site and the Service.&nbsp.\nAs further described below, in limited circumstances we may disclose collected information, including Personal Information, to certain third parties in connection with providing Services or as required by law.&nbsp.\nWe will not use or disclose collected information in ways different from what is described in this policy unless otherwise required by law.</p>\n<p>We also use information collected through the Site and the Service to communicate with Registered Users from whom such information was collected in order to provide promotional materials about us.&nbsp.\nHowever, unlike communications which are necessary to provide Services (\u201cNecessary Communications\u201d), promotional communications are optional (\u201cOptional Communications\u201d), and Company will refrain from sending that kind of information to you if you inform us that you prefer not to receive them, as described in more detail below.</p>\n<p>Company uses Non-Personal Information in a variety of ways, including, by way of example, to evaluate the performance of the Site and Service and the general preferences of users, or to generate anonymous statistics for our benefit or for our business partners.&nbsp.\nBecause Non-Personal Information is entirely anonymous, and therefore can never be used by us to identify you, this policy does not limit our ability to use or disclose Non-Personal Information.\nWe may create Non-Personal Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you.</p>\n<p>If we collect information through the Site and/or the Service that you provide to us voluntarily through online forms or surveys, through e-mail communications or by other means, we will treat that information as described above, as applied to both Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a necessary part of providing Services, we may disclose information collected from you as described in this policy.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may disclose certain Personal Information about you to our third-party service providers (e.g., our third party payment processors), so long as they are only using the Personal Information to provide services to us.\nIf another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Information collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.\nUnder certain limited circumstances, we may cooperate with legal investigations and/or we may be subject to legal requirements to disclose information collected through the Site or Services, such as, by way of example, to a court or a governmental agency, and our policy is to provide such cooperation and comply fully with all such legal requirements.&nbsp.\nWe may also disclose Personal Information to protect or defend the rights or property of Company or users of the Services and/or to investigate any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or Terms and Conditions.&nbsp.\nThe disclosures contemplated by this paragraph (\u201cNecessary Disclosures\u201d) are necessary if you wish to use the Service.&nbsp.\nAs mentioned above, Company may use and disclose Non-Personal Information without restriction.&nbsp.\nIf you do not want us to make such Necessary Disclosures, or to use Non-Personal Information without restriction, you must not use the Service.</p>\n<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site.\nThese companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, go to www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>\n<p>If you enter and win a contest or other promotion, you expressly consent to (a) Company providing your Personal Information (e.g., your name and address) to the third party providing the prize for the contest or other promotion, solely to provide you such prize and (b) Company publicly disclosing your name and the fact that you won the contest or promotion.&nbsp.\nIf we will be disclosing additional Personal Information in connection with a contest or other promotion, we will disclose that to you in a separate notice prior to your entering the contest or other promotion.&nbsp.\nBy entering such contest or other promotion, you expressly consent to such disclosures.</p>Choice, Opting-In and Opting-Out Regarding Optional Communications<p>Because we respect your privacy, we may from time to time provide certain opportunities for you to indicate your preferences regarding how we use and/or disclose information collected about you from the Site and the Service.&nbsp.\nIf you are an Registered User, by indicating your preferences in the online profile your create, which includes your registration information and other information voluntarily provided by you (your \u201cRegistration Profile\u201d), you will be able to inform us whether you wish to receive certain Optional Communications from us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We do not maintain responsibility for the manner in which third parties use or further disclose Personal Information collected from you through the Site or Services, after we have disclosed that information to those third parties.&nbsp.\nHowever, we do require our third-party service providers to promise not to use such information except as necessary to provide the relevant services to us.&nbsp.\nIf you do not want Company to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the manners identified in this policy as Necessary Communications and/or Necessary Disclosures, you may not use the Site or any Service.</p>\n<p>The Site contains links to other Web sites.&nbsp.\nPlease be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other Web sites.\nWe encourage our users to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site they visit.&nbsp.\nThis privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us through the Site.</p>Access To Personal Information Collected From You<p>Registered Users may access their Registration Profiles at any time to update Personal Information contained within that Registration Profile.&nbsp.\nSubsequent uses or disclosures of information by us will reflect those changes, but we have no ability to update any information previously disclosed to any third party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).&nbsp.\nWhen we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.</p>\n<p>The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of Personal Information in Company's possession and control.&nbsp.\nFor example, whenever the Service requests that Registered Users provide sensitive information, that information is encrypted with industry standard encryption techniques.&nbsp.\nWhen you are viewing a secure page within the Site, such as our checkout form, an icon of a padlock will appear as \u201clocked\u201d at the bottom of web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, but the same icon will appear as \"un-locked\" when the user is merely \u201csurfing.\u201d We currently use an encryption program known as \u201cSSL,\u201d or \u201cSecure Sockets Layer.\u201d&nbsp.\nTo learn more about SSL, go to https://www.ssl.com/.\nCredit card authorization requests are sent using the same encryption technology.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, access to Personal Information is physically restricted within our own offices, so that only certain of our employees are granted access to information as appropriate to perform specific jobs and tasks (e.g., performing customer service).</p>\n<p>Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide security for information in our possession and control, no security system can prevent against all potential security breaches, and we bear no liability for uses or disclosures of Personal Information or Non-Personal Information arising in connection with the theft thereof.&nbsp.\nLikewise, Registered Users are responsible for safeguarding the confidentiality of passwords to any Services, and we bear no liability for access to, or use or disclosure of, Personal Information, if such access, use or disclosure arises in connection with the theft or disclosure (whether intentional or negligent) of a password.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our security measures, you can click here to contact usclick here to contact us.</p>Changes to This Policy<p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Site so that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we will disclose it.\nAny changes will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site.\nThese changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Service.\nIn any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of Personal Information that you provided us prior to our notification to you of the changes.\nIf you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us.\nYour continued access to and/or use of the Site or Service following notice of such changes
