agreement between you and IObit with respect to this transaction.\nAny changes to this Agreement must be made in writing, signed by an authorized representative of IObit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Section 13.\nClaims Resolution.</strong> Most customer concerns can be resolved through IObit\u2019s online support center (available at www.iobit.com/onlinefeedback.php) or by calling our customer service department at the toll-free number IObit has provided you.\nIn the event that IObit is unable to resolve a complaint to your satisfaction, this section explains how claims can be resolved through mediation, arbitration or litigation.\nIt includes an arbitration provision.</p>\n<p>For this section, the words \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cIObit\u201d include any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities.\nThe word \u201cclaim\u201d means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy relating to the Product, this Agreement, and this Claims Resolution provision, except for the validity, enforceability or scope of the Arbitration provision.\nThe word \u201cclaim\u201d also includes but is not limited to: (i) initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims and third-party claims.\n(ii) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity.\n(iii) claims by or against any third-party using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with Agreement.\nand (iv) claims that arise from or relate to advertisements, promotions or oral or written statements related to the Product.\nYou or IObit may not sell, assign or transfer a claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sending a Claim Notice</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Before beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and IObit agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation.\nGo to https://www.iobit.com/en/sampleclaim.php for a sample claim notice.\nThe claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded.\n</p>\n<p>Notice to IObit must include your name, address, the name of the Product at issue, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the email address you previously provided to us, if any, and the license code IObit provided to you, if any.\nThe notice must be sent to customercare@iobit.com.\nIf the claim proceeds to arbitration, the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mediation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim.\nThe mediator does not decide the claim but helps the parties reach agreement.</p>\n<p>Before beginning mediation, you or IObit must first send a claim notice.\nIf you live within the United States, within thirty days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or IObit may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com), the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) (1-800-778-7879, adr.org), or another mutually agreed upon mediator, for mediation.\nIf you live outside of the United States, you may contact IObit for information on potential mediators.\nIObit will pay the fees of the mediator.</p>\n<p>All mediation-related communications are confidential, inadmissible in court and not subject to discovery.\nAll applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled until termination of the mediation.</p>\n<p>Either you or IObit may terminate the mediation at any time.\nThe submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or IObit\u2019s rights under this Claim Resolution provision.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you live in the United States, you or IObit may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration.\nIf you do not live in the United States, this arbitration subsection does not apply to you.\nIn individual arbitration, claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator.</p>\n<p>If arbitration is chosen by any party, neither you nor IObit will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim.\nFurther, neither you nor IObit will have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject to arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited.\nThe arbitrator's decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nExcept as set forth below, the arbitrator's decision will be final and binding.\nOther rights you or IObit would have in court may also not be available in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Initiating Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Before beginning arbitration, you or IObit must first send a claim notice.\nClaims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party electing arbitration.\nClaims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization's rules in effect when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Arbitration provision.\nIf IObit choose the organization, you may select the other within thirty days after receiving notice of IObit\u2019s selection.\nContact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information.\nClaims also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and IObit agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (the \u201cFAA\u201d).</p>\n<p>You or IObit may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final judgment has been entered.\nEither you or IObit may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights.</p>\n<p>IObit will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitations on Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis.\nThere will be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, other licensees or other persons similarly situated.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator's authority is limited to claims between you and IObit alone.\nClaims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and IObit agree in writing.\nAn arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award.\nNotwithstanding any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these limitations on Arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA.\nThe arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges.\nThe arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery.\nSubject to the Limitations on Arbitration, the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court.\nThe arbitration will be confidential, but you may notify any government authority of your claim.</p>\n<p>If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing.\nAt any party's request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award.\nThe arbitrator's award will be final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA.\nhowever, any party will have thirty days to appeal the award by notifying the arbitration organization and all parties in writing.\nThe organization will appoint a three-arbitrator panel to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to by any party.\nJudgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>At your election, any in-person arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in a court of general jurisdiction.\nIObit will be responsible for any additional arbitration fees.\nAt your written request, IObit will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Awards</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer IObit made before arbitration, the arbitrator's award will include: (i) any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than $2,000.\nand (ii) any reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Right To Reject Arbitration</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may reject this Arbitration provision by sending a rejection notice to IObit at: customercare@iobit.com.\nYour rejection notice must be sent within 30 days after your first download or purchase of the Product.\nYour rejection notice must state that you reject the Arbitration provision and must include your name, address, the date of download or purchase of the Product, the name of the Product, the email address you previously provided to IObit, if any, and the license code IObit provided to you, if any.\nIf your rejection notice complies with these requirements, this Arbitration provision will not apply to you, except for any claims subject to pending litigation or arbitration at the time you send your rejection notice.\nRejection of this Arbitration provision will not affect your other rights or responsibilities under this Agreement.\nRejecting this Arbitration provision will not affect your ability to use the Product.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Continuation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Claims Resolution provision will survive termination of this Agreement or your license to use the Product.\nIf any portion of this Claims Resolution provision, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration provisions above, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution provision.</p>\t", "created_at": "2021-07-12 05:13:44.479249", "updated_at": "2021-07-12 03:16:11.531675"}, {"id": 8375, "name": "Refund Policy ", "url":
