trials and\nclass actions.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a\nneutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited.\nArbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a\ncourt.\nThis arbitration clause shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p>\n<br>\nBinding Arbitration <p>This provision is intended to be\ninterpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or\nrelating to this Agreement, and your relationship with us.\nAny dispute or claim\narising out of or relating to this Agreement or use of the Card and your\nrelationship with Us or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies\n(whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any\nother legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either\nof us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such\na court.</p>\n<br>\nOpt-Out <p>Notwithstanding the above, you\nmay choose to pursue your claim in court and not by arbitration if you opt out\nof this arbitration provision within 30 days from signing up for the Rewards\nprogram (the \"Opt Out Deadline\").\nYou may opt out of these arbitration\nprocedures by sending us a written notice that you opt out to the following\naddress: ZipLine 300 Lock Road, Suite 202, Deerfield Beach, FL 33442.\nAny\nopt-out received after the Opt Out Deadline (allowing three (3) additional days\nfor mailing) will not be valid and you must pursue your claim in arbitration or\nsmall claims court.</p>\n<br>\nArbitration Procedures <p>For all disputes, whether\npursued in court or arbitration, you must first send a written description of\nyour claim to our Customer Service department to allow us an opportunity to\nresolve the dispute.\nYou and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good\nfaith.\nYou may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved\nwithin 60 days.</p>\n<p>The arbitration of any dispute\nor claim shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American\nArbitration Association (\"AAA\"), including the AAA's Consumer\nArbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules\nand information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org.\nYou and we agree that this Agreement evidences a\ntransaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be\ninterpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act\nand federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law.\nAny arbitration\nwill be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you\nreside or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be\nconducted in the English language.\nAn arbitrator may award on an individual\nbasis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or\ndeclaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and\nmust follow and enforce this Agreement as a court would.\nAny arbitration shall\nbe confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or\nresults of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of\nenforcement of the arbitration award.\nJudgment on any arbitration award may be entered\nin any court having proper jurisdiction.</p>\n<br>\nCosts of Arbitration <p>Upon filing of the arbitration\ndemand, we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than\nthe initial $200 filing fee, and for claims of less than $1,000, we will\nreimburse you for the filing fee within 30 days of receiving a written request\nfrom you.\nEach party will bear the fees and expense of its own attorneys,\nexperts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the\narbitration.\nHowever, for claims under $10,000 as to which you provided notice\nand negotiated in good faith as required above before initiating arbitration,\nif the arbitrator finds you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you\nwill be entitled to a recovery of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\nExcept\nfor claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek an award of\nattorneys' fees in arbitration even if an award is otherwise available under\napplicable law.</p>\n<br>\nClass Action Waiver and Jury Waiver <p>You and we each agree that any\nproceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an\nindividual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.\nIf\na court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this\nclass action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration agreement will be void as\nto you.\nIf you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this\nclass action waiver provision will not apply to you.\nNeither you, nor any other\nconsumer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate\nin a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied\nwith the opt out procedure set forth above.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds\nin court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a\njury trial.</p>\n<br>\nGoverning Law - New York <p>This Agreement shall be governed\nby and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York\nnotwithstanding any conflict of law rules.</p>\n<br>\nDisclaimers and Limits of Liability <p>We and our affiliates make no\nrepresentations, warranties or conditions of any

liability,\nstrict liability or other theory, even if we or our authorized representatives\nhave been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nIn no event shall we or our\naffiliates have any liability for unauthorized access to, or alteration, theft\nor destruction of a Rewards account or the App through accident, misuse or\nfraudulent means or devices by you or any third party, or as a result of any\ndelay or mistake resulting from any circumstances beyond our control.</p>\n<p>The laws of certain states or\nother jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or the\nexclusion or limitation of certain damages.\nIf these laws apply, some or all of\nthe above disclaimers, exclusions or limitations may not apply to you, and you\nmay have rights in addition to those contained in this Agreement.\nIn such\njurisdictions, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by\nlaw.</p>\n<br>\nAssignment <p>We may assign all or part of\nthis Agreement
