to the Due Date.\nIt is your responsibility to submit payments to arrive by the Due Date specified on the bill or statement.\nIf you initiate processing on a date that causes payment to be delivered after the Due Date, we are not responsible for any late charges that you may be charged by the Payee.\nWe may set a maximum dollar amount for payment, and/or refuse to permit any bill payment if we
