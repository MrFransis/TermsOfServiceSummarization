How do we protect and store personal information?<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously and are committed to protecting your privacy by using a combination of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.\nThese measures include multi-factor authentication, masking, encryption, logging and monitoring, described below.\nWe store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide you with our programs, products, and services and for a reasonable time thereafter, or as permitted or required by law.</p>More detailsA.\nHow We Protect Personal Information<p>To protect your personal information, we maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in our stores, pavilions, kiosks, offices, digital properties, and information storage facilities.\nBy having these safeguards, we aim to avoid the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of your personal information that we hold.\nThese safeguards also apply when we dispose of or destroy your personal information.</p>\n<p>For example, where appropriate, we use the following safeguards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Multi-Factor Authentication, </b>which is a method of confirming your identity by using more than one way to authenticate you, such as asking for your password and a code that is sent to your email address or phone number;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Masking, </b>which is the process of obscuring your information so that the structure remains the same but the content is no longer identifiable;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Anonymization, </b>which is the process of altering your data so that it can no longer be used to identify you personally;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Encryption, </b>which is the process of obscuring your information in order to make it unreadable without the use of a code or a key.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Logging and monitoring, </b>which is the process of tracking, recording and monitoring activity related to the access and/or use of your accounts or personal information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>B.\nWhere We Keep Personal Information<p>We use all reasonable safeguards, including contractual requirements with our service providers, to protect your personal information wherever it is used or stored.\nIn general, we store, access and use personal

us.\nWhen we engage a service provider that operates outside of Canada, personal information may be stored, processed, accessed or used in another country.\nIn that case, the personal information is subject to the law of the jurisdiction in which it is used or stored, including any law permitting or requiring disclosure of the information to the government, government agencies, courts and law enforcement in that jurisdiction.\nThe countries where our service providers may be located include the United States, the Netherlands, India, and the Philippines.\n&nbsp.\n</p>C.\nHow Long We Keep Personal Information<p>We will store your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, except where otherwise required or permitted by law (e.g., healthcare providers must retain patient records in accordance with their statutory retention obligations).\nOnce no longer required, your personal information will be securely destroyed or anonymized (so the information no longer identifies you).</p>\n<p>Please note that if your personal information is collected by a third party, it will be retained in accordance with the privacy policies and records retention requirements of that&nbsp;third party.</p>8.0 How do I request access to my personal information?<p>Under Canadian privacy law, you have the right to access the personal information we hold about you, subject to any legal restrictions.\nUpon request, we will provide you with access to your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, in compliance with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>It is your responsibility to provide accurate, correct and complete information.\nIf you notice any errors in your personal information or need to update it, please let us know through
