broadcast on Periscope\u2019s website.\nIf you do choose to create an account, you must provide us with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you.\nOn Twitter this includes a display name (for example, \u201cTwitter Moments\u201d), a username (for example, @TwitterMoments), a password, and an email address or phone number.\nYour display name and username are always public, but you can use either your real name or a pseudonym.\nYou can also create and manage multiple Twitter accounts<sup>1</sup>, for example to express different parts of your identity.<br>\n</p>\n<p>pageReference: /content/twitter-com/legal/en/privacy/chapter-1/chapter-1-1</p>\n<p>Content:</p>\n<p>The many sides of you</p>\n<p>Let your imagination run free.\nExplore your interests with a number of different identities.\n</p> Close tooltip &nbsp.\n<p>1.2</p> Public Information <p>Most activity on Twitter is public, including your profile information<sup>2</sup>, your time zone and language, when you created your account, and your Tweets and certain information about your Tweets like the date, time, and application and version of Twitter you Tweeted from.\nYou also may choose to publish your location in your Tweets or your Twitter profile.\nThe lists you create, people you follow and who follow you, and Tweets you Like or Retweet are also public.\nIf you like, Retweet, reply, or otherwise publicly engage with an ad on our services, that advertiser might thereby learn information about you associated with the ad with which you engaged such as characteristics of the audience the ad was intended to reach.\nPeriscope broadcasts you create, click on, or otherwise engage with, either on Periscope or on Twitter, are public along with when you took those actions.\nSo are your hearts, comments, the number of hearts you\u2019ve received, which accounts you are a Superfan of, and whether you watched a broadcast live or on replay.\nAny hearts, comments, or other content you contribute to another account\u2019s broadcast will remain part of that broadcast for as long as it remains on Periscope.\nInformation posted about you by other people who use our services may also be public.\nFor example, other people may tag you in a photo<sup>3</sup> (if your settings allow) or mention you in a Tweet.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for your Tweets and other information you provide through our services, and you should think carefully about what you make public, especially if it is sensitive information.\nIf you update your public information on Twitter, such as by deleting a Tweet or deactivating your account, we will reflect your updated content on Twitter.com, Twitter for iOS, and Twitter for Android.</p>\n<p>By publicly posting content when you Tweet, you are directing us to disclose that information as broadly as possible, including through our APIs, and directing those accessing the information through our APIs to do the same.\nTo facilitate the fast global dissemination of Tweets to people around the world, we use technology like application programming interfaces&nbsp;(APIs) and embeds to make that information available to websites, apps, and others for their use - for example, displaying Tweets on a news website or analyzing what people say on Twitter.\nWe generally make this content available in limited quantities for free and charge licensing fees for large-scale access.\nWe have standard terms that govern how this data can be used, and a compliance program to enforce these terms.\nBut these individuals and companies are not affiliated with Twitter, and their offerings may not reflect updates you make on Twitter.\nFor more information about how we make public data on Twitter available to the world, visit

phone number, to authenticate your account and keep it - and our services - secure, and to help prevent spam, fraud, and abuse.\nWe also use contact information to enable certain account features (for example, for login verification or Twitter via SMS), and to send you information about our services, and to personalize our services, including ads.\nIf you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages from Twitter to that number as your country\u2019s laws allow.\nTwitter also uses your contact information to market to you as your country\u2019s laws allow, and to help others find your account if your settings permit, including through third-party services and client applications.\nYou can use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from Twitter.\nYou can also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or here.</p>\n<p>You can choose to upload and sync your address book on Twitter so that we can help you find and connect with people you know and help others find and connect with you.\nWe also use this information to better recommend content to you and others.</p>\n<p>You can sign up for Periscope with an account from another service like Twitter, Google, or Facebook, or connect your Periscope account to these other services.\nIf you do, we will use information from that service, including your email address, friends, or contacts list, to recommend other accounts or content to you or to recommend your account or content to others.\nYou can control whether your Periscope account is discoverable by email through your Periscope settings.</p>\n<p>If you email us, we will keep the content of your message, your email address, and your contact information to respond to your request.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>1.4</p> Direct Messages and Non-Public Communications <p>We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately or control who sees your content.\nFor example, you can use Direct Messages to have non-public conversations on Twitter, protect your Tweets, or host private broadcasts on Periscope.\nWhen you communicate with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store and process your communications and information related to them.\nThis includes link scanning for malicious content, link shortening to http://t.co URLs, detection of spam<sup>4</sup>, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues.\nWe also use information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not the content of those communications) to better understand the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform, and to show more relevant content.\nWe share the content of your Direct Messages with the people you\u2019ve sent them to.\nwe do not use them to serve you ads.\nNote that if you interact in a way that would ordinarily be public with Twitter content shared with you via Direct Message, for instance by liking a Tweet, those interactions will be public.\nWhen you use features like Direct Messages to communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;of your communications on Twitter - even if you delete your copy of those messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or re-share.</p>\n<p>pageReference:

from Twitter or Periscope, along with other information associated with the ad you clicked such as characteristics of the audience it was intended to reach.\nThey may also collect other personal data from you, such as cookie identifiers or your IP address.</p> &nbsp.\n<p>2.3</p> Cookies <p>A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on your computer or mobile device.\nLike many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to operate our services.\nCookies are not required for many parts of our services such as searching and looking at

your computer<sup>7</sup>.\nHowever, some of our services may not function properly if you disable cookies.\nWhen your browser or device allows it, we use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage patterns, and to personalize and otherwise operate our services such as by providing account security, personalizing the content we show you including ads, and remembering your language preferences.\nWe do not support the Do Not Track browser option.\nYou can learn more about how we use cookies and similar

from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.&nbsp;Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the websites and apps of ad partners and
