right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third party beneficiary hereof.\n</p>\n<p>Informal Dispute Resolution.&nbsp.\nBefore filing a claim against the Company, please contact us at the contact information under Contacting Us.\nWe'll try to resolve the Dispute informally.\nIf a Dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or the Company may bring a formal arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p>We Both Agree To Arbitrate.\nYou and the Company both agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under the exceptions below.</p>\n<p>Governing Law of Arbitration Terms.\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, you and the Company agree that these arbitration terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(\u201cFAA\u201d), will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and proceedings pursuant thereto.\nIt is the intent of the parties that the FAA and JAMS Rules preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nIf the FAA and JAMS Rules are found not to apply to any Disputes that arise under these arbitration terms or the enforcement thereof, then that Dispute is to be resolved under the laws of the state of California.</p>\n<p>Procedures of Arbitration: The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules, including the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards.\nJAMS\u2019s rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fees for Arbitration: Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, Company will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration: The arbitration will be held in San Francisco, California, or the United States county where you live or work, or any other location we agree to.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Exceptions:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either the Company or you may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California or any United States county where you live or work.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Either the Company or you may bring a lawsuit for injunctive or other equitable relief in San Francisco County, California to prevent threatened or actual misappropriation, violation, or infringement of a party\u2019s intellectual property rights, including copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No Class Actions.\nNo Jury Trial: <strong>Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis.\nClass arbitrations, class actions, and collective, consolidated or representative actions are not permitted.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING (A) THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND (B) THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on a class, collective, consolidated or representative basis, but only on an individual basis.\nOther than disputes regarding the validity of the class action waiver contained herein and the exceptions set forth herein, which disputes may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction, all Disputes regarding the scope and validity of these Terms will be resolved by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nHowever, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these Terms as a court would.</p>\n<p>One Year to Bring Action.\nYOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS) BROUGHT BY YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO A DISPUTE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.\nOTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>\n<p>Commencing an Arbitration Proceeding: To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Company at the following address:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apartment List, Inc.<br>Attention: Legal<br>475 Brannan Street, Suite 410<br>San Francisco, CA 94107&nbsp;</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>email: legal@apartmentlist.com.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Severability of Arbitration Terms: If part of these arbitration terms are deemed unenforceable or unlawful, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful term is to be severed from these Terms.\n(2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful term will not impact the remainder of the arbitration terms.\nand (3) to the extent that any claims must proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, those claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\n<p>Opt-Out Procedure:&nbsp.\nIf you are a new user of our Services, you can choose to reject the arbitration terms by mailing us at:</p>\n<p>Apartment List, Inc.<br>Attn: Legal<br>475 Brannan Street, Suite

these Terms will continue to apply to you.\nOpting out of the arbitration terms has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration terms that you may have with us.</p>\n<p>Changes to Arbitration Terms: If we change these arbitration terms after the date you first agreed to these Terms (or later agreed to amended Terms), you may reject the change by providing us with written notice of your rejection within 30 days after the date the change became effective, as indicated in the \"Last Updated\" date above.\nYou must provide this written notice by mail at:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apartment
