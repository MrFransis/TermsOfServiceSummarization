Anokhi Privacy Compliance <p>\n<strong>Anokhi\u2019s Compliance with Privacy Regulations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is </strong>\n<strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong> (<strong>GDPR)?&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At its core, GDPR is a new set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data.\nIt aims to simplify the regulatory environment for business so both citizens and businesses in the European Union can fully benefit from the digital economy.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, almost every aspect of our lives revolves around data.\nFrom social media companies, to banks, retailers, and governments \u2013 almost every service we use involves the collection and analysis of our personal data.\nYour name, address, credit card number and more all collected, analyzed and, perhaps most importantly, stored by organizations.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What are key provisions of the GDPR?&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The GDPR defines personal data as any information related to a natural person (data subject) that can be used to directly or indirectly identify that person.\nIt can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or even a computer IP address.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under such a broad definition, enterprises must take documented steps to limit access to all personal data to only authorized and credentialed employees with job roles that specifically require access to that data.\nSecurity breaches from lack enforcement of security protocols will be met with stiff fines and financial penalties under the GDPR.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The GDPR also establishes specific rights with regard to data subjects.\nTo comply with the GDPR, these codified rights must be acknowledged and implemented by all companies collecting personal data on EU citizens.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The GDPR specifically prohibits the use of long, convoluted terms and condition statements, particularly statements that contain legalese.\nAny request for consent, declaration of terms, or statement of privacy must be presented clearly and concisely, and without any ambiguity of meaning.\nFurthermore, it must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The GDP also makes it crystal clear that businesses and organizations handling private or sensitive data must ask for consent and permission each and every time they access the data.\nUnder the regulations, companies cannot ask for permission to access private data once and then consider that access to cover all future transactions.\nUnder the GDPR, there is no such thing as a continuous blanket consent.\neach time data is used for a new purpose a new request for consent is required.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Breach notification</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Compliance with the GDPR requires companies to notify all data subjects that a security breach has occurred within 72 hours of first discovering it.\nThe method of this notification will include as many forms as deemed necessary to disseminate the information in a timely manner, including email, telephone message, and public announcement.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to access</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The GDPR requires companies to provide, at the data subject\u2019s request, confirmation as to whether personal data pertaining to them is being processed, where it is being processed, and for what purpose.\nCompanies must also be able to provide, free of charge, a copy of the personal data being processed in an electronic format.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to be forgotten</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Under the GDPR, companies will erase all personal data when asked to do so by the data subject.\nAt that point, the company will cease further dissemination of the data, and halt all processing.\nValid conditions for erasure include situations where the data is no longer relevant, or the original purpose has been satisfied, or merely a data subject\u2019s subsequent withdrawal of consent.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data portability</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The GDPR requires companies to provide mechanisms for a data subject to receive any previously provided personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format.\nUnder this provision, the data subject also has the right to request the company transmit the data to another processor, free of charge.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Privacy by Design</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Compliant companies must follow Privacy by Design principles and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in an effective way to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect the rights of data subjects.\nIn practical terms, this provision means that companies will process only the data absolutely necessary for the completion of its business and limit access to personal data to only those employees needing the information to complete the process consented to by the data subject.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Protection Officers</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Large enterprises wishing to comply with the GDPR will maintain thorough and comprehensive records pertaining to the collection, processing, and storage of personal data.\nIn addition, these enterprises will designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee the application of the GDPR and to protect personal data from misuse and unauthorized access and other security breaches.\nA DPO is required for any enterprise with over 250 employees or for any enterprise processing the personal data of over 5,000 data subjects in any 12-month period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is the California Consumer Privacy Act </strong>(<strong>CCPA)?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In June 2018, the California legislature passed the CCPA.\nThe CCPA is a privacy law is designed to give Californians more control over their personal information.&nbsp.\nThe CCPA\u2019s was created to address growing consumer concerns about data protection and provide California consumers with important controls over their personal information.&nbsp.\nAlthough it was passed in June 2018, the CCPA will go into effect on January 1, 2020.\nThe CCPA has already been amended to include a grace period for businesses in which the Attorney General cannot bring an enforcement action until six months after final regulations have been published, or July 1, 2020, whichever is sooner.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Data protections the CCPA introduces include:<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to access information</strong> \u2013 Consumers in California will be able to know the \u201cwhat, who, and why\u201d surrounding their personal information.\nSpecifically, they can request the following, which must be provided in a portable format:&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which categories of personal information were collected, shared, or sold&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Categories of sources from which this personal information was collected, with whom it was shared, and to whom it was sold to</li>\n<li>The specific pieces of personal information it has collected about that consume</li>\n<li>Why the personal information was collected&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to deletion</strong> \u2013 Consumers in California will be able to request that a company delete the personal information it has collected about them.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to opt out</strong> \u2013 Consumers in California will be able to direct a company to not sell their personal information to third parties.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that the definition of \u201csell\u201d in the bill is broader than simply monetary exchange.<br>\n</p>\n<p>It is interesting to note that CCPA has a broader definition of personal information than GDPR.&nbsp.\nThe CCPA\u2019s take on what constitutes \u201cpersonal information,\u201d as seen below, is even broader than GDPR\u2019s definition:<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cPersonal information\u201d is anything that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.</em>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do we at Anokhi address GDPR and CCPA?&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our belief at Anokhi is that all data, personal or not, is owned by the consumer.\n&nbsp.\nAnd we are simply guardians of the data, on behalf of the consumer.\nThough GDPR and CCPA are similar, GDPR specifically controls the sale of consumer data without consent, while CCPA requires organizations provide information to the consumer about what, where and how the data is being used.\nBoth provide provisions for the consumer to opt out, and otherwise delete or otherwise forget their data that is being stored.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>We at Anokhi provide data banking services for consumers, and do so only with the expressed consent of the consumer.\nData will not be sold, or otherwise monetized, unless explicitly authorized by the consumer.\nThe consumer may withdraw consent at any time, and without notice.\nLet\u2019s go through each of the GDPR and CCPA requirements one at a time.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Consent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Anokhi will specifically ask for consent for every different data type (Location, app data, calendar, social media etc.) prior to storing it in the consumer data bank.&nbsp.\nNo data will be stored in the consumer\u2019s bank without consent.\nAnokhi will also ask for consent prior to generating derived or inferred data and storing that data in the data bank.&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Breach Notification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At Anokhi, we take data security seriously.\nHowever, in case of any data breach, Anokhi will notify the consumer through the Anokhi application on Android or IOS, or via SMS or notifications services on the mobile phone, as applicable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Right to Access</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Upon request, Anokhi will provide the user complete access to the data being stored in the bank via a downloadable .csv (comma delimited format).<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Right to be Forgotten</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The consumer can close the Anokhi data account at any time, and the data will be deleted.\nOptionally, the consumer can download a copy of all the data prior to deletion.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Data Portability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Upon request, Anokhi will provide the user complete access to the data being stored in the bank via a downloadable .csv (comma delimited format).<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Privacy By Design</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All data being stored by Anokhi will be stored securely and encrypted.\nAccess to that data is only available to Anokhi employees cleared by the Data Protection Officers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>GDPR \u2013 Data Protection Officers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In case of any questions, reports of misuse or comments, Anokhi\u2019s DPO can be contacted at dpo@anokhi.ai.\nAnokhi maintains complete records of all transactions.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CCPA \u2013 Right to access Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Anokhi account application provides access to all categories of personal information, to whom it was shared and to whom it was sold.\nIn addition, detailed data as to what specific pieces of personal information have been collected is available at all times through the application.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CCPA \u2013 Right to Deletion</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The consumer can close the Anokhi data account at any time, and the data will be deleted.\nOptionally, the user can download a copy of all the data prior to deletion.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>CCPA \u2013 Right to Opt-Out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>With an Anokhi data bank account, the consumer always has the right to use the bank just to store data and not sell it or use it any way, and opt out of all use.\n&nbsp.\nThe consumer can also opt out of using Anokhi completely by closing the account at any time.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> About Us <ul>\n<li>About

that are purchased through Anokhi\u2019s marketplace and linked to your Anokhi account as payment methods.\nHowever, even without your Anokhi account, you can still use the codes you received by email when you purchased the gift certificates/cards to make purchases.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, you may not close your Anokhi account, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To evade an investigation.</li>\n<li>If you have a pending transaction or an open dispute or claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If your Anokhi account has a negative balance.</li>\n<li>If your Anokhi account is subject to a hold, limitation or reserve.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Link or Unlink a Payment Method</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can link or unlink a U.S.\nbank account or Anokhi Credit to your Anokhi account as a payment method.\nPlease keep your payment method information current.&nbsp.\nIf this information changes, we may update it using information and third party sources available to us without any action on your part.&nbsp.\nIf you do not want us to update your information, you may contact your issuer to request this or remove your payment method from your Anokhi account.\nIf we update your payment method, we will keep any preference setting attached to such payment method.\nYou may choose to confirm your account, so that we can verify that the account is valid and that you are the owner.&nbsp.\nTo do this, we will charge you $1.95.&nbsp.\nAfter the account is confirmed, we will immediately refund this amount to the account.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holding a Anokhi Balance</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Money/points that you receive from other Anokhi buyers is held as a balance in your Anokhi account.\nThe balance functionality in your Anokhi account will differ depending on whether we have been able to verify the required identifying information that you provide to us.\nThe required identifying information is: name, physical address, date of birth and taxpayer identification number.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we have not verified the required identifying information, a balance in your Anokhi account can generally only be held in your Anokhi account and transferred to a linked bank account or debit card.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any Anokhi balance you hold represents an unsecured claim against Anokhi and, except as provided below, is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\nAnokhi combines your Anokhi balance with the Anokhi balances of other Anokhi users and invests those funds in liquid investments in accordance with state money transmitter laws.\nAnokhi owns the interest or other earnings on these investments.\nHowever, the claim against Anokhi represented by your Anokhi balance is not secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments.\nThese pooled amounts are held apart from Anokhi\u2019s corporate funds, and Anokhi will neither use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes nor will it voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing Your Money in Multiple Currencies</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Holding a Anokhi balance in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your Anokhi balance may be held in any of the currencies supported by Anokhi, and you may hold a balance in more than one of these currencies at the same time.\nIf we have not verified the required identifying information that you provide to us, you can only access balance that is in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars by transferring the balance to a linked bank account or to an eligible debit card and such a transfer will require a currency conversion (with payment of the applicable currency conversion spread) as discussed below.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining a Anokhi balance in multiple currencies.&nbsp.\nYou may not manage multiple currencies for speculative trading purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Currency conversion</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some uses of your Anokhi account require a currency conversion.&nbsp.\nSome examples of situations where a currency conversion is required include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Purchasing goods from a seller who accepts payments only in a specific currency which you do not hold in your Anokhi account.</li>\n<li>Sending money to a bank account in a currency that you do not hold at the time of the transaction.</li>\n<li>Receiving money either from a buyer in a currency that your Anokhi account is not configured to accept.</li>\n<li>Converting your Anokhi balance from one currency to another, not in connection with any transaction.</li>\n<li>Withdrawing funds from your Anokhi balance held in a currency other than U.S.\ndollars to the bank account linked to your Anokhi account.</li>\n<li>If you sold something and the transaction must be refunded or reversed, and you do not have the correct currency available in your Anokhi balance at the time of the refund or reversal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How we convert currency</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If Anokhi converts currency, it will be completed at the transaction exchange rate we set for the relevant currency exchange.\nThe transaction exchange rate is adjusted regularly and includes a currency conversion spread (described below) applied and retained by us on a base exchange rate to form the rate applicable to your conversion.\nThe base exchange rate is based on rates within the wholesale currency markets on the conversion day or the prior Business Day.\nor, if required by law or regulation, set at the relevant government reference rate(s).</p>\n<p>For&nbsp;purchase and send money transactions described above that involve a currency conversion, the&nbsp;currency conversion spread is 3.0%.\nFor all other transactions involving a currency conversion,&nbsp;the currency conversion spread is 2.5%.</p>\n<p>When
