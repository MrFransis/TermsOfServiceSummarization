known as the Facebook Rules), Conduct in VR Policy, Oculus Platform Abuse Policy, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Oculus Products.\nWe may remove, delete or restrict access to content that we determine to violate such terms and policies, including content that infringes intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another's copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods).\nWe encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights or our terms and policies.\nIf you believe that anything on or available through the Oculus Products infringes upon any intellectual property rights you own or control, you may submit a notification of such infringement with our Designated Agent as stated below:</p>\n<p>Designated Agent <br> Facebook Technologies, LLC <br> 1601 Willow Road <br> Menlo Park, CA 94025, US <br> Phone: +1 (650) 543 4800 <br> Email address:

grant you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to access, use, and download (as permitted by the functionality of the Oculus Products), the Software and Content on devices you own or control, solely for personal non-commercial purposes, conditioned on your compliance with the Terms.\nIn order to maximize your enjoyment, safety and overall experience through Oculus Products, unless we have expressly stated otherwise in writing, the Oculus PC app (formerly, Rift runtime) may only be used with Oculus Product devices and other hardware devices we approve, and with software developed using the Oculus PC Software Development Kit, as specified in the applicable Oculus SDK license agreement.\nWe also require that you use only the then-current version of the Software and Content.\nAny unauthorized use of the Oculus Products, including the Software and Content, is strictly prohibited and will cause the license granted in these Oculus Terms to terminate automatically.\nNo licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise, except for the licenses and rights expressly granted to you herein.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Third-Party Services.</b> Oculus Products can be used to access software, applications, services, content, and virtual items (including, but not limited to, third-party digital content, additional or enhanced functionality, or media content purchased through Oculus Products) provided by third parties (\"<b>Third-Party Services</b>\").\nIn some cases, Facebook or its affiliates may distribute Third-Party Services to you on behalf of the third party.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Third-Party Services may be subject to additional terms, conditions, fees, and policies imposed by the third party (together, <b>\"Third-Party Terms\"</b>).\nIn the event that Third-Party Terms conflict with the provisions of these Terms, these Terms will govern.\nYou are responsible for complying with any applicable Third-Party Terms, and we recommend that you review any applicable Third-Party Terms before using Third-Party Services.\nYour use of Third-Party Services is at your own risk.\nWe have no obligations or liability with respect to transactions you enter into with a third party, your access to or use of any Third-Party Services, or any content or functionality therein, your rights to which are solely provided pursuant to a license between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services.\nIn no event will Facebook or its affiliates be considered the licensor of Third-Party Services, to have granted any rights to use Third-Party Services, to have assumed any obligations (including support obligations) with respect to the Third-Party Services, or to have made any representations or warranties with respect to Third-Party Services.\nIf you are not presented with an end user license agreement when you acquire Third-Party Services, the following license terms apply to your use of such Third-Party Services: (a) the third party providing the Third-Party Services (and not Facebook or its affiliates) is the licensor of such Third-Party Services.\n(b) such third party grants you a limited, non-transferable license to access and use the Third-Party Services only for your personal and non-commercial purposes.\nand (c) you may not modify, decompile or disassemble the Third-Party Services in whole or in part, or create any derivative works from or sublicense any rights in or to the Third-Party Services, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the third party or as permitted under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions.\nFacebook and its affiliates are not parties to the license agreement between you and the provider of such Third-Party Services or other Third-Party Terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third-Party Services may require access to Facebook data and services, which is subject to agreements between the third parties that provide such Third-Party Services and us.\nWe may disable this access for a Third-Party Service if the third party does not comply with these agreements, our policies, applicable law, or if the agreements are otherwise terminated.\nThis may adversely affect your use of such Third-Party Services, including by making such Third-Party Services partially or fully inoperable.\nWe will not incur any liability to you if we remove or disable access to data and services by a third party for these reasons.\nThis means, without limitation, that we will not provide you with any refunds for such Third-Party Services in these cases.\nAny rights, including refund claims, which you may have under your agreements with third parties remain unaffected.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Ratings and Objectionable Content.</b> We may display age, comfort and content ratings for digital content that are based on information provided to us by the developers of such content.\nWe cannot guarantee that digital content ratings will always be accurate, nor can we promise that you will not find some material harmful, offensive, indecent or objectionable.\nThe Oculus Products may contain links to third-party websites, applications or other Third-Party Services, and you understand that by accessing third-party links, you may be exposed to content that is offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate.\n<b>You understand that you may be exposed to content from a variety of sources when using Oculus Products and acknowledge that content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable.</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Age Restrictions.</b> You may only access certain digital content if you are of or above the age displayed to you when you order the digital content.\nIf we determine that you did not comply with these age requirements, we may disable your access to the digital content and we will not refund the amounts paid for the digital content.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Additional Provisions</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Functionality may change or be limited.</b> To access and use certain features of the Oculus Products, a Facebook account is required, eligibility for which is stated in Section 3.1 of the Facebook Terms of Service.\nWe work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Oculus Products better for you and our community.\nWhere permitted by applicable law, we may introduce new features, impose limits on, suspend, eliminate, change, or update certain existing features or any part of Oculus Products, or restrict access to parts or all of any Oculus Products.\nAny obligation we have to make such features and functionality available to you is therefore subject to the ongoing availability of that particular feature and functionality on the Oculus Products.\nWe may offer free trials or other limited versions of the Oculus Products so that you can preview the Oculus Products before purchase.\nThese versions may have limited features, restrict the permitted time of use and contain other limitations.\nThe features, functionality, or availability of a Third-Party Service may change or be discontinued, including if the developer of such Third-Party Service violates our terms or policies, or in accordance with the Terms or the applicable Third-Party Terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Account suspension or termination.</b> In addition to what is stated in Section 4.2 of the Facebook Terms of Service, your access to or use of Oculus Products may be suspended or disabled, and you may lose access to, or use of part or all of, the services offered by Facebook or third parties through Oculus Products, if: (1) we determine you have breached the Terms, Community Standards (also known as the Facebook Rules), Conduct in VR Policy, Oculus Platform Abuse Policy, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of Oculus Products or Third-Party Services.\n(2) we believe your access to, or use of, Oculus Products creates a health and safety risk.\nor (3) Facebook suspends or disables your Facebook account.\nFurthermore, we may suspend or disable your access to or use of Oculus Products if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.\nIf you delete or we disable your access to or use of Oculus Products, these Oculus Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but certain sections will survive termination as provided in Section 3.8 below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Updates to these Oculus Terms.</b> These Oculus Terms may be updated from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices.\nWe will only make changes to these Oculus Terms if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests.\nWe will notify you (for example, by email or through Oculus Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Oculus Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless the changes are required by law.\nWe hope that you will continue using Oculus Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Oculus Terms, you must cease use of Oculus Products.\nYour continued use of Oculus Products after the effective date of the updated Oculus Terms constitutes your acceptance of those terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Network charges.</b> You may be charged by your network provider for data services or other third-party charges that may arise while using the Oculus Products, and you accept responsibility for such charges.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>DISCLAIMERS.\nLIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Oculus Products may be subject to limitations, delays, and/or other problems inherent to the use of the internet and electronic communications and are not guaranteed to be available and error free at all times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are important health and safety warnings and instructions that you must read before using Oculus Products, which are available at https://www.oculus.com/legal/health-and-safety-warnings/.\nTo reduce the risk of personal injury, discomfort, and property damage, please ensure that all users of your Oculus Products read the warnings and instructions provided at the link above carefully before using your Oculus Products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warning: Failure to follow this health and safety information may result in damage to Oculus Products, accessories or any connected devices, and may increase the risk of

any updates thereto), and will act in accordance with such warnings and instructions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Oculus Product devices are covered by a Limited Warranty (located at

Warranty.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</b>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that you have any dispute with us that is connected to these Oculus Terms or use of Oculus Products or related services, you may contact us and we will endeavor to resolve this dispute.\nIf you are not happy with how we resolve this dispute or you do not want to engage directly with us in relation to it, you are informed that an alternative dispute resolution procedure is offered by the European Commission through the platform for Online Dispute Resolution available at the following address: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&amp;lng=EN.</p>\n<p>These Oculus Terms and any other non-contractual dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the section of the Facebook Terms of Service, which governs \u2018Disputes\u2019.\nFor avoidance of doubt, if any portion of these Oculus Terms is found to be unenforceable (including but not limited to the terms of this Section), the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.\nIf we fail to enforce any of the Oculus Terms, it will not be considered a waiver.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Transfer and Trade Compliance.</b> Oculus Products are only intended for use in the Supported Countries.\nCertain Oculus Product functionality and services may not be accessible outside of, and may vary among and within, the Supported Countries.\nYou will not, and will not allow others to, use, distribute or transfer, Oculus Products in any manner that violates applicable law, including all applicable export control and trade sanctions laws of the United States, the European Union, Member States of the European Union and any other applicable governmental authority.\nOculus Products may not be resold, transferred or otherwise disposed of in a country subject to an embargo or to a person or organization sanctioned by the United States, the European Union, Member States of the European Union without obtaining required approvals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Termination.</b> These Oculus Terms are effective until terminated, and will terminate when the Facebook Terms of Service between you and us is terminated.\nUpon termination, these Oculus Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the provisions in Sections 2.3, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 of these Oculus Terms will survive and remain in place.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Other Terms</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Facebook Terms of Service, these Oculus Terms, and all other applicable terms (including, if applicable, a Product Testing Agreement, as defined below) make up the entire agreement between you and Facebook regarding your use of Oculus Products (except to the extent that we expressly state that separate terms \u2013 and not these \u2013 apply) and supersede any prior agreements regarding your use of Oculus Products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you use an Oculus Product pursuant to a product testing agreement, beta testing agreement, or similar agreement (a <b>\"Product Testing Agreement\"</b>), in the event of a conflict between such Product Testing Agreement and the Terms, the Product Testing Agreement shall govern to the extent of the conflict.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Terms govern personal and non-commercial uses of Oculus Products.\nWe may permit certain limited commercial or business uses of Oculus Products under these Terms pursuant to and solely as stated in separate Oculus Commercial Terms and any other applicable terms referenced therein.\nBy using Oculus Products for such commercial or business uses under these Terms, you agree to the Oculus Commercial Terms.\nAdditionally, we permit commercial and business uses of Oculus for Business products pursuant to the Oculus for Business Enterprise Use Agreement (available at https://business.oculus.com/legal/enterprise-use-agreement/) and any other applicable terms referenced therein.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To the extent you are using Oculus Products in your capacity as a developer of software or content for use on the Oculus Products, you acknowledge and agree that our agreements with you as a developer supplement the Terms and will supersede to the extent of any conflict between such agreements and the Terms.\nIf you are a business established in the European Union or in the United Kingdom and publish content on the Oculus Platform offered to end users located in the European Union or the United Kingdom, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice developer.oculus.com/policy/p2b/, which

assign, transfer, or subcontract all or any of its rights or obligations under these Oculus Terms.\nNothing in these Oculus Terms limits any of our rights under the Facebook Terms of Service or any additional terms that they reference.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>QUEST 2</li>\n<li>RIFT S</li>\n<li>ACCESSORIES</li>\n<li>APPS

Policy<p>\n<i>Date of Last Revision: October 11, 2020</i>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers.\nCookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones, and other devices.\nOther storage technologies are used for similar purposes, such as storing data on your web browser or device, placing identifiers on your device and other software.\nIn this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as \"cookies.\"</p>\n<p>We use cookies if you access and use Oculus websites, Oculus Browser or Oculus mobile apps (\u201cOculus Services\u201d).\nCookies enable us to offer Oculus Services to you and to understand the information we receive about you, whether or not you are registered or logged in.</p>\n<p>This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have.\nExcept as otherwise stated in this policy, the Supplemental Oculus Data Policy or the Oculus Privacy Policy (as applicable) will apply to our processing of the data we collect via cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Why do we use cookies?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Oculus Services, such as by remembering your choices and settings, personalizing content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience.\nWhile the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Oculus Services, we use them for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Authentication</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you're logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Oculus Services and show you the appropriate experience and features.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Oculus webpages.\nCookies also help us remember your browser so you do not have to keep logging into your account when you are browsing the Oculus website.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Security, site and integrity</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Oculus Services safe and secure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access an Oculus account without authorization, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords.\nWe also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Oculus Services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Oculus accounts.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Advertising, recommendations, insights and measurement</b>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are used to help show you relevant content and ads, and to measure the performance of ad campaigns, including on third-party websites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies allow us to help deliver ads about Oculus and recommend products and services based on your activity on the Oculus Services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Providing features and remembering preferences</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to remember your settings and preferences and to enable the functionality that helps us provide the Oculus Services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us store preferences and provide you with customized content and experiences.\nFor instance, cookies allow us to remember your language choice and locale.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Performance</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to provide you with the best experience possible.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly our Oculus Services load for different people.\nCookies also help us record the ratio and dimensions of your screen and windows and know whether you've enabled high-contrast mode, so that we can render our sites and apps correctly.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Analytics and research</b>\n</p>\n<p>We use cookies to better understand how people use the Oculus Services so that we can improve them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<i>For example:</i> Cookies can help us understand how people use the Oculus Services, analyze which parts of the Oculus Services people find most useful and engaging, and identify features that could be improved.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Do other parties use cookies in connection with the Oculus Services?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Yes, other parties may use cookies on the Oculus Services for the purposes described above.</p>\n<p>For example, our measurement partners use cookies on the Oculus Services to help us understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and to compare the performance of those campaigns to ads displayed on other websites and apps.\nLearn more about the companies that use cookies on the Oculus Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>How can you control our use of cookies?</b>\n</p>\n<p>You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies, including for advertising.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Although most browsers and devices accept cookies by default, their settings usually allow you to clear, configure or decline disable cookies.\nFollow the instructions provided by your website or mobile browser (usually located within the \"Help\", \"Tools\" or \"Edit\" facility) to modify your cookie settings.\nPlease note that if you set your browser to disable cookies or other technologies, you may not be able to access certain parts of the Oculus Services and other parts of our Oculus Services may not function properly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Check your mobile device settings that control ads based on your interactions with the applications on your device.\nFor example, on your iOS device, you can enable the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d setting, and on your Android device, you can enable the \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d setting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To turn off sharing usage statistics and crash reports from your Oculus Browser, click Settings in Oculus Browser and toggle the switch next to Analytics to Off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google\u2019s opt out browser add-on.\nTo opt out of ads on Facebook, Pinterest or Google that are targeted to your interests, you can adjust your Facebook, Pinterest or Google ads settings.\nFor information on managing Flash cookies, please visit the Adobe Flash Player website.\nYour browser\u2019s privacy controls may enable you to manage other types of local storage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For information on how our
