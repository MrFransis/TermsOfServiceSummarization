Store paying us&nbsp;first.\nUnfortunately, at times for various reasons, the Affiliate Store does not recognise an order as valid and as such would not pay us&nbsp;for it.\nWhile we typically seek to make a case before the Affiliate Store for payment, unfortunately, we are unable to credit cashback unless and until such payment is received.</p>\n<b>Data Collection &amp.\nUse of Personal
