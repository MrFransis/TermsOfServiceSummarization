leverage to secure our cloud service infrastructure:</p>\nInfrastructure and Physical Security<p>When we selected an infrastructure provider, we drew on our technical team\u2019s experience in developing and operating market-leading cloud services.\nThis enabled us to build in security and availability at every layer, from physical security through to computer, network, and storage.\nWe complement these measures with well-defined security and access policies, and prove our security using ongoing third-party audits and certification.</p>\n<p>We protect your data at every point in our infrastructure, including compute, storage, and network transmission.</p>\n<p>We ensure that all of our service providers meet our data protection standards.</p>We continuously monitor the health of our service and show customers those metrics via this trust portal.Secure Personnel<p>Our security-focused culture starts at the highest level with a chief security officer who reports directly to the CEO on security issues.\nIt extends throughout the company via a security team that trains employees to watch for social engineering attacks like phishing, and tests them regularly to ensure compliance.\nWe also support this culture with a policy that limits the amount of employees who have access to production systems.</p>Our security controls govern employees and contractors before, during, and after their time at Okta.Our security team builds security into our culture by promoting security awareness and testing employees to ensure compliance.We reduce risk by limiting production access to those that need it to do their jobs, while continuing to monitor their access.Secure Development Lifecycle<p>We begin building security into our software before we write any line of code.\nStrict security checkpoints govern every step of our development lifecycle from design through to coding, testing, and deployment.\nOur internal security team works with independent external security researchers to validate our software security.</p>\n<p>Each year, we train our developers in the latest secure programming and code review techniques.</p>\n<p>Our software security is regularly reviewed by peers, in-house security researchers, and third-party security assessors.</p>\n<p>Our software development lifecycle includes more than 60,000 tests.</p>\n<p>Our coding tools automatically assess software security as they build our web applications.</p>Our internal penetration testing team continually audits source code per OWASP standards to measure source code integrity.Secure Customer Data<p>Okta\u2019s data protection meets the highest industry standards, complying with FedRAMP and NIST 800-53, HIPAA, and ISO 27001 requirements.\nOur state-of-the-art

with third-party security audits, a public bug bounty program, and a highly-responsive customer bug reporting program.\nWe also believe in the customer\u2019s right to conduct a penetration test on Okta, and so we provide them with test environments to do that.</p>We support multiple security and penetration testing programs in parallel.We provide environments to support customers\u2019 own

2021</p>\n<strong>I.\nIntroduction</strong>\n<p>At Okta, data privacy is important to us.\nThis Okta Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) details our privacy practices for the activities described in this Privacy Policy.\nPlease take the time to read this Privacy Policy carefully in order to understand how we collect, share, and otherwise process information relating to individuals (\u201cPersonal Data\u201d), and to learn about your rights and choices regarding our processing of your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>In this Privacy Policy, \u201cOkta,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and \u201cus\u201d each mean Okta, Inc.\nand the applicable Okta affiliate(s) involved in the processing activity.\nThe addresses of our offices, where Okta, Inc.\nand our affiliates are located, can be found at&nbsp;<strong>https://www.okta.com/contact.</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>II.\nOkta\u2019s Roles &amp.\nResponsibilities</strong>\n<p>Okta is the controller of your Personal Data, as described in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp.\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the extent that we process Personal Data in the role of a processor (or a comparable role such as \u201cservice provider\u201d in certain jurisdictions) on behalf of our customers, including where we offer to our customers various cloud products and services, through which our customers (and/or their affiliates) connect their own websites and applications to our hosted platform, sell or offer their own products and services, send electronic communications to other individuals, or otherwise collect, use, share or process Personal Data via our cloud products and services.</p>\n<p>Each of our customers, not Okta, controls whether they provide you with a subscription to the Okta identity cloud service, and if they provide you with a subscription, they control what information about you that they submit to our service.\nThis content may include contact information (such as your first and last name, email address, and phone number), professional information (such as the department you work for at your place of employment), or other types of information a customer chooses to submit.\nUse of this content by Okta is governed by agreements between Okta and the Customer.</p>\n<p>For detailed privacy information applicable to situations where an Okta customer (and/or a customer affiliate) who uses Okta\u2019s cloud products and services is the controller, please reach out to the respective customer directly.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nIf not stated otherwise either in this Privacy Policy or in a separate disclosure, we process such Personal Data in the role of a processor or service provider on behalf of a customer (and/or its affiliates), who is the responsible controller of the applicable Personal Data.</p>\n<p>If your Personal Data has been submitted to us by or on behalf of an Okta customer and you wish to exercise any rights you may have under applicable data protection laws, please inquire with the applicable customer directly.\nBecause we may only access a customer\u2019s data upon instruction from that customer, if you wish to make your request directly to us, please provide to us the name of the Okta customer who submitted your Personal Data to us.\nWe will refer your request to that customer and support them as needed in responding to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<p>Additional information regarding Okta\u2019s data protection obligations to our customers are set forth in our subscription agreement form and related documents, including our Trust &amp.\nCompliance Documentation, all of which are available online at&nbsp;<strong>https://www.okta.com/agreements</strong>.</p>\n<strong>III.\nPersonal Data We Collect and Data Sources</strong>\n<strong>Covered Data Processing Activities</strong>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the processing of Personal Data that we collect in the following ways, as detailed in this section.</p>\n<p>We collect information about you when you provide it to us, when you interact with our websites and electronic systems, and when you attend events and visit our offices, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information you provide to us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Based on our current practices (and including our practices over the last 12 months), we collect the following categories of information about you:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact and Professional Data:</strong>&nbsp;We collect contact and/or professional data about you in person, through communications, including communications from you or your colleagues, and through our websites.\nFor example, you provide your contact and professional information to us when you sign up to learn more about Okta\u2019s products and services, download content, register for an event, and visit our offices.\nIf you attend an event, we may also receive contact and professional details about you when you choose to scan your attendee badge or by providing a business card or other method where you share Personal Data with us.\nTypically, contact data includes your name and contact methods, such as telephone number, email address, and mailing address, and professional data includes details such as the organization you are affiliated with, your job title, and industry.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Biographical, Community, and Support-related Data:&nbsp;</strong>We may also collect various types of biographical, community, and support-related Personal Data from you via our help center and community support forums.\nFor example, if you register for an online community that we host, we may ask you to provide a username, photo and/or biographical information, such as your occupation, organization name and areas of expertise.\nAdditionally, you may provide Personal Data to us when you create user-generated content (for example, by posting in a forum), provide Okta with feedback, or when you participate in interactive features, trainings, online surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, activities, or events.\nYou may also be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other information that would be helpful in resolving a customer support request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Job Applicant Data:&nbsp;</strong>You provide your contact and professional information, including your resume with educational and work background, when you apply for a job with Okta.\nYou may also provide us with sensitive information, like your Social Security Number or other government identifier, racial or ethnic origin, or other such Personal Data in connection with your job application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contract and Payment Data:</strong>&nbsp;We may receive contract details (like signatures) from you or your organization and use third party payment processing services to collect payment and billing information, which may contain Personal Data such as billing name, billing address and payment card details, in connection with some of our products and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Audio, Electronic, or Visual Data:&nbsp;</strong>If you attend an Okta in-person or virtual event or agree to be recorded in a telephone or video meeting, we may record some or all of that event or meeting.\nFor events, we may document the event in various ways, such as by taking photos at the event, interviewing you at the event, or recording your participation in a live question and answer or other interactive session.\nWe use this information for business and marketing purposes to better inform the public about Okta, its events, and provide testimonials about our products and services.</p>\n<strong>Personal Data We Collect From Other Sources</strong>\n<p>In the course of doing business (and over the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy), we receive Personal Data and other information from other third parties for our business or commercial purposes.\nThis information varies and typically falls into a few categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Business contact information (such as name, job title, business email, phone number, and address), social profile (such as LinkedIn or XING) including other details about your company for sales and marketing purposes, including to better inform you about Okta products and services;</li>\n<li>Third-party platform usernames and identifying information;</li>\n<li>Details about you as a job candidate (which may include your name, resume, educational and work history, criminal history information, and feedback) as permitted under law.\nand</li>\n<li>Data used for security purposes to protect our products and services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We receive business contact information that contains Personal Data for commercial purposes, including details about your company from third parties for marketing and business intelligence, such as analyzing business opportunities, identifying potential new customers, and providing our audience with more relevant content and advertising.\nTypically, we receive this information about you from a few sources, such as: (i) third-party marketing initiatives, such as events where we are a sponsor or website forms hosted by third parties that may provide content about us.\n(ii) when you consent to having your attendee badge scanned at an event hosted by us or another third party.\n(iii) companies, such as information aggregators and similar entities, from whom we have licensed business contact information.\nand (iv) referrals.\nIn some situations, we may combine such business contact information with other non-personal and Personal Data we possess or that you have provided to us.\nFor example, we may combine business contact details with details about your organization, such as its address or revenue range, and analyze this information for business opportunities or use this to send you tailored content.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nWe also receive information from third-party platforms for various business purposes such as credit, program management, or technical reasons.\nFor example, we may receive credit information about an enterprise that includes the names of individuals.\nIf you participate in an open source project or our public bug bounty program, we may receive details about you, such as your username or pull requests, to help us manage your participation in the project or program and provide you with updates.</p>\n<p>If you are a candidate applying for a job at Okta, we may receive Personal Data about you from third parties for business purposes, such as through background checks (educational, employment, criminal, and financial information), publicly-available sources (like social media accounts, including LinkedIn for identifying candidates), feedback about your application and from interviews, and other third parties that may provide feedback about your application.</p>\n<p>For our professional services work, as a processor or service provider, Okta may also receive Personal Data about you to perform its obligations under its contract with a third party.\nOkta partners may also share your business contact information with Okta as part of their recommendation to your company to become an Okta customer.\nIf Okta is interested in partnering with, acquiring, investing in, or partners with, acquires, or invests in your employing or retaining company, Okta may receive Personal Data about you through the (potential or completed) transaction for its business purposes.</p>\nDevice Data, Usage Data, and Metadata We Collect\n<p>\n<strong>Explanation of Device Data, Usage Data, and Other Metadata and Technology Used</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Like most websites, applications, and software across the Internet, Okta collects certain Personal Data.\nThis type of data collection allows us to better understand how individuals use our websites, products and services and how they perform.\nFor example, we may collect metadata about you, including technical data about your performance or use of our website, products and services.\nWe may also collect device data about you to help us determine that users from one type of device use our websites, products and services in different ways than users of a different type of device, which in turn allows us to improve our websites, products and services, such as through optimizing the screen size of Okta mobile applications, or making sure our customers\u2019 users have a more efficient user experience.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>\nOne common technology we use to collect metadata that may be considered Personal Data is our use of cookies.\nCookies are small text files that are placed on your web browser and that help us recognize your browser or device as a unique visitor in different ways based on the type of cookie.\nThe three main types of cookies are:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential cookies.</strong>&nbsp;Essential cookies are required for website functionality and security.\nFor example, authentication, security, and session cookies may be required for our website or products to work.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Functional cookies.&nbsp;</strong>We use functional cookies to help enhance our websites\u2019 performance, for market research, or other analytics or advertising that is not tied to a specific individual.\nFor example, we may use Google analytics to help us track how many individuals visited our website.\nWe may also utilize HTML5 local storage cookies for the reasons described in this section.\nThese types of cookies are different from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store and how they store it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Targeting or advertising cookies.</strong>&nbsp;We use targeting and advertising cookies to help us understand our marketing efforts and to reach potential customers across the web.\nFor example, we contract with third-party advertising networks that may track your activity over time and across different channels, including our websites, email activity, and other websites and applications that display advertisements.\nThey may use this tracking information to understand and predict your interests, to display an advertisement for Okta on another website, or email you with a marketing communication for an Okta product.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you would like to manage your cookies and your permissions to share data with cookie providers, please visit the section below on<strong>&nbsp;Your Information Choices</strong>.</p>\n<p>A second common technology we use to collect metadata that may be considered Personal Data is beacon technology.\nWe use beacons in our websites and in email communications to you.\nBeacons provide us with information about your activity and help us to improve our business operations and strategy, such as by understanding our email communications\u2019 functionality and improving our websites and content.\nFor example, if you click on a marketing email we send to you about a new product or service, the beacon will provide signals to us that you and your organization may be interested in learning more.\nIf you would like to manage your email subscriptions with us, please visit the section below on&nbsp;<strong>Your Information Choices</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Collected from the Okta Service and Ancillary Products</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We offer products that collect both Customer Data and Usage Data (as defined in our agreements with customers, including from the Okta Service).\nOur collection of both types of data enables us to provide and innovate upon the Okta Service, which in turn allows us to act as a service provider to our customers and to continuously improve upon the services we provide to our customers.\nIn conjunction with the products we make available to our customers, we may collect additional data, such as user-agent and browser version, IP address, the URLs you visit, logs of your usage and click activities, logs about your login history, identity confirmation, and device data (such as whether your device is managed by an administrator, the operating system installed on the device, certain device configurations, and similar device or version information).\nFor the Okta Mobility Management product, data collected may include the applications that are installed on your device.\nCollectively, we refer to this data as \u201cAncillary Data\u201d.\nSome of the Ancillary Data we receive is dependent on your organization\u2019s policies and settings and what it permits to be shared with Okta.\nOkta uses Ancillary Data to improve security and to provide and improve its products to customers, including to better understand customer behavior to create new features and provide threat-related insights for our customers.\nFor example, we may use the URL you visit to let you better manage your passwords for the websites you visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some of these products that collect and process Ancillary Data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Okta browser plugin.\nand</li>\n<li>the Okta mobile applications (Okta Verify and Okta Mobile).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the Okta browser plugin, the Ancillary Data we collect includes details about your login session, IP address, user-agent, and the web application name and website address, as well as other information that is not personal in nature.\nIn addition, we may collect interaction data about your use of the Okta browser plugin..\nWe use the information collected through the Okta browser plugin for security purposes and to provide features, such as by allowing you to better manage your passwords for websites that you visit.</p>\n<strong>Okta as a Business</strong>\n<p>As with most websites, whenever you visit an Okta website, take an Okta training, engage with the Okta Community, or when you interact with Okta promotional content, Okta may receive both Personal Data about you from information-gathering tools and passive information collection on our websites, including Personal Data from our websites you visit or emails we send.\nThis information collection typically includes information such as cookies, beacons, demographic information, company and role details, market research and publicly-available information, IP address, device and browser details, usage information, timestamps, pages viewed, searches, interaction with and action taken by you on our websites or content, as well as other non-Personal Data.\nIf you sign up to participate in specific programs, such as the Okta Ideas forum, we may analyze usage data related to your use of our Service along with the data you choose to provide to us through Okta Ideas to provide you with a better customer experience.</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect as a business to analyze and predict results arising from our sales and marketing efforts, improve the performance of our websites, products and services and customer support, identify potential customers, opportunities, and potential new product areas, ascertain trends, improve our websites\u2019 functionality, improve our security, and provide us with general business intelligence, including through the use of machine learning technology.\nWe may also combine the metadata and usage information collected from our websites with other information to help further the purposes described in the previous sentence.</p>\n<strong>Intentional Disclosures to Third Parties</strong>\n<p>As part of the functionality we make available on our websites and to better reach our customers and prospective customers, there may be categories of third parties that are authorized by us to operate on our websites and access your Personal Data, such as your contact data, IP address or cookies.\nDepending on your location, (for example, for visitors from California and the European Union), Okta only shares Personal Data with such third parties if you agree to such sharing through a website banner or form.\nIn other parts of the world, this information may be automatically collected when you visit our websites.\nThese categories of third parties include, but are not limited to, advertising networks and social networks.\nAt any time, you may choose to withdraw your decision to share personal data with these third parties through our websites by visiting the section on&nbsp;<strong>Your Information Choices&nbsp;</strong>below.\nFor specific details on these companies\u2019 privacy practices, please visit their privacy policies.</p>\n<strong>IV.\nHow We Use Personal Data</strong>\n<p>How we use the Personal Data we collect depends in part on how you choose to communicate with us, how you use our websites and interact with us, and any preferences you have communicated to us.&nbsp.\nIn general, we use your Personal Data as is necessary to run our business and carry out our day-to-day activities.\nIn addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may use your Personal Data to accomplish the following tasks (and we have done so during the 12 months preceding the effective date of this Privacy Policy):</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Communicate with you about our products and services and facilitate other interaction.</strong>&nbsp;We may use your Personal Data, such as contact data, Ancillary Data, and metadata, to send you transactional communications, notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages regarding our products and services that may be useful to you and your organization.\nWe will respond to your questions, provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us, and help you use our products and services effectively.&nbsp.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Support safety, security, and manage operations.&nbsp;</strong>We use Personal Data, such as contact data, Ancillary Data and other metadata, about you and your use of our products, services, and offices to verify accounts and activity, monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity, assist our customers in their monitoring of suspicious or fraudulent activity, and identify violations of policies regarding the use of our products and services.\nWe also process Personal Data for security and operations management reasons, such as to register visitors to our offices, including to manage non-disclosure agreements that visitors may be required to sign.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Market and promote our products and services.</strong>&nbsp;We use your Personal Data, such as contact data, Ancillary Data, and other metadata, about how you use the products and services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you and your organization, including by email and by displaying Okta marketing communications on other companies\u2019 websites and applications, as well as on third-party platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Google.\nThese communications are aimed at encouraging engagement and maximizing the benefits that you and your organization can gain from Okta\u2019s products and services, including information about new products and features, survey requests, newsletters, and events we think may be of interest to you and your organization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Manage contests or promotions and customer appreciation.</strong>&nbsp;Okta may occasionally run contests or other special promotions or make available opportunities or other tokens for customer appreciation, and if you register for these, we may process your Personal Data, such as contact information, biographical information, and contract-related data to perform our contract with you.\nOkta may also use the Personal Data, such as contact data, collected in these contests, promotions, and for customer appreciation as well as to send you promotional material about Okta and our partners.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Process payments.&nbsp;</strong>We process Personal Data, such as contact information, contract-related data, financial information, biographical information, and payment information to process payments to the extent that doing so is necessary to complete a transaction and perform our contract with you or your organization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recruiting.</strong>&nbsp;We process your Personal Data, such as contact, job applicant, and biographical data, to assess your application and to evaluate and improve the recruitment system, our application tracking and recruitment activities.\nWe also use your Personal Data to communicate with you regarding your application or opportunities at Okta that appear over time that we believe may be of interest to you.\nWe also use your Personal Data to send you new hire and employee experience information.\nWe may verify your information, including through reference checks and, where allowed, background checks.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other purposes for our legitimate interests:&nbsp;</strong>Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests, or the interests of others, we may use your Personal Data in connection with the management of our business, including but not limited to, for operational purposes, legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, protecting against misuse or abuse of our products and services, and protecting personal property or safety.\nFor example, we may review compliance with applicable usage terms in our customer contracts, assess capacity requirements for our products, websites, and offices, improve your user experience, respond to requests by you for support or for contact, or identify customer opportunities.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other purposes with your consent:</strong> We may use your Personal Data if you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.\nFor example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote our products and services or record phone calls for quality and training purposes, with your permission.</p>\n<p>If we process your personal data for a purpose other than that set out above, we will provide you with information prior to such processing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data (for European Economic Area Individuals)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis or bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.\nThe legal bases depend on the products and services that your organization has purchased from Okta, how such products and services are used, and how you choose to interact and communicate with Okta\u2019s website, systems, and whether you attend Okta events.\nThis means we collect and use your Personal Data only where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We need it to operate and provide you with our products and services, provide customer support and personalized features, and to protect the safety and security of our products and services;</li>\n<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest of Okta\u2019s (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to provide information to you about our products and services that we believe you and your organization may find useful, and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>\n<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.\nor</li>\n<li>We need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have consented to our use of Personal Data about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp.\nWhere we are using your Personal Data because we or a third party (for example, your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use.\nhowever, in some cases, this may mean that you no longer use our products and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>V.\nPersonal Data Shared by Okta</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;For all categories of information that we collect, we share Personal Data with our service providers for various business purposes, including, but not limited to, auditing interactions with users, debugging our websites, products and services, security purposes, internal research and gleaning insights through machine learning, short-term uses such as credit verification, payment processing, IT services, quality control and safety, gift fulfillment, in-person and virtual event management, as well as to perform other services on our behalf.\nFor example, we may use service providers to help us proctor and score Okta certification exams or host our customer relationship management system.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In-person and Virtual Events.</strong>&nbsp;If you choose to register for or attend a virtual or in-person event or webinar that we host (such as our Oktane customer conference), enter a contest or raffle with us and a sponsor, or download content (such as a whitepaper) from our website, then we will share your contact information, content interest information or other activity data, and any other information, including Personal Data, collected in the course of these activities for commercial purposes with those sponsors.\nIn many cases, you intentionally disclose your details by providing your information to these sponsors through consent via a registration form or by scanning your badge at the applicable sponsor\u2019s booth.\nVirtual events hosted by third party platforms may also collect additional data from you when you visit their sites.\nThe treatment of this information is subject to each of these third parties\u2019 respective privacy statements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Partners and Resellers.</strong>&nbsp;We share your Personal Data, such as contact information, business details, and content interest and activity details, with our partners and resellers for business purposes, such as to carry out our business or for joint marketing efforts to reach our customers and prospective customers.\nIn many cases, you intentionally disclose your details by providing your information to these sponsors through consent via a registration form.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Protection of Rights, Security and Fraud Detection.</strong>&nbsp;For all categories of data we collect, we share your Personal Data with third parties for business purposes to protect our customers, users, secure our physical and
