have purchased subscriptions from Guilded to support the Creator\u2019s server (\u201cSubscribers\u201d).\nWhen we use the word \u201cyou\u201d in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether he or she is a Creator or Subscriber, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of user.</p>\n<p>We can\u2019t and won\u2019t be responsible for ensuring that information (including credentials) a Creator or Subscriber provides about himself or herself is accurate or up-to-date.\nWe don\u2019t control the actions of any Creator or Subscriber, and Creators aren\u2019t our employees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You hereby acknowledge that Guilded does not supervise, direct, or control any Creator and expressly disclaims any responsibility and liability for the Creator or Creator\u2019s servers, including but not limited to any express or implied warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law.<br>\n<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<em>\n<strong>Are there any terms specific to me as a Creator or Subscriber?</strong>\n</em>\n<p>\n<strong>Creators</strong>: To become a Creator, create and launch your server on Guilded, link your account to Stripe (which will include linking your bank account information to Stripe), and start inviting users to your server.\nAs a Creator you make your server

will remit to you on a monthly basis (or more or less frequently, as determined in Guilded\u2019s discretion) via the payment method connected to your account on the Services: (a) the payout due to you from your server subscriptions, less payment processing fees (\u201cPayouts\u201d) and (b) depending on the region, certain taxes and ancillary fees.&nbsp.\nThe rates payable to you for Payouts are set forth at https://support.guilded.gg/, which may be updated from time to time.&nbsp.\nIt is your responsibility to check the Payouts page for any changes, and your continued use of the Services

that sometimes such activities can put your account balance into the negative.\nIf your balance becomes negative then we reserve the right to recover those funds from future payouts.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that, for the mutual benefit of the parties, through advertising and marketing, Guilded may seek to attract new users to Guilded and to increase existing use of Guilded\u2019s

collected.\nCreator also must not use any Subscriber Information beyond what is necessary to perform the Creator Services for such applicable Subscriber.\nUpon the conclusion of the Creator Services

it whatsoever.\nCreators must collect, use, maintain, and transmit all Subscriber Information in compliance with all applicable laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Subscribers:&nbsp;</strong> As a Subscriber, you may purchase subscriptions from Guilded to support a certain Creator or Creator server.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Creators\u2019 server subscriptions vary, and we have no control over a Creator\u2019s specific offerings and cannot guarantee the identity of a Creator or the validity of any claims they make.\nPlease see the section below titled \u201cDo the Services cost anything\u201d

of, the Payment Processor.\nBy choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d).\nYou agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.\nWe reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.\n&nbsp.\nc.\n<strong>Payment Method</strong>.\nThe terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method.\nIf we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.\n&nbsp.\nd.\n<strong>Recurring Billing</strong>.\nSome of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you.\nBy choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation.\nWE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED

INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.\nCHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT YOUR SETTINGS PAGE.\nIF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.\n&nbsp.\nf.\n<strong>Change in Amount Authorized</strong>.\nIf the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction.\nAny agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method.\nYou agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.\n&nbsp.\ng.\n<strong>Auto-Renewal for Paid Services</strong>.\nUnless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your settings page, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate.\nTo change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to your settings or, for mobile applications, cancel your subscription in the subscription management section of the applicable App Store.&nbsp.\nIf you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.\nHowever, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.\nIF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH YOUR SETTINGS OR TERMINATE YOUR GUILDED ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM.\nPAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED

expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your

applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Agreement</em>\n<em>.\n</em>Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Guilded and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Guilded.\nBoth you and Guilded acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Guilded\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>\n<p>\n<em>(a) Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement</em>.\nThe parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration.\nIf such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cRules\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes.\nThe arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b) <em>Costs of Arbitration</em>.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nGuilded will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.\nGuilded will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(c) <em>Small Claims Court.\nInfringement</em>.\nEither you or Guilded may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County or any United States county where you live or work.\nFurthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(d) <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>.\nYOU AND GUILDED WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou and Guilded are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn any litigation between you and Guilded over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND GUILDED WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>(e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Guilded is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(f) <em>Opt-out</em>.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 2619 McKinney Ave, 1806, Dallas, TX 75204 USA, postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Guilded to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Guilded agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, or the federal district in which that county falls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(h) <em>Severability</em>.\nIf the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void.\nThis arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Guilded.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Miscellaneous</em>.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that Guilded may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit.\nThe failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nIf any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nYou and Guilded agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Guilded, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Guilded, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Guilded in any respect whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Guilded agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>\n<ul>\n</ul> Was this article helpful? <small> 256 out of 285 found this helpful </small> Have more questions?

part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business\u2019 or websites\u2019 policies.\n&nbsp.\n<strong>Our Agents:</strong> We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.\nfor example, if you ever purchase anything on Guilded,

month ago</li>\n<li>Updated</li>\n</ul> Introduction&nbsp.\n<p>Guilded was founded with one humble goal&nbsp;<em>\u2014</em> to connect gaming communities.\nIn pursuit of this goal, we've developed a host of features for your community to chat, organize, share content, recruit, and compete with one another.</p>\n<p>We recognize that for communities to flourish, players need to be both empowered to express themselves while also feeling safe and free from abuse.\nTo that end, we've drafted a series of Community Guidelines to help communicate how the policies established in our<strong> Terms of Use</strong> affect our users and servers, and how we can promote diverse conversations across our communities.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\n&nbsp.\nGuidelines\n<p>In order to provide a safe and fair environment for our users, some content and activity is not permitted on our services.\nContent and activity that is not tolerated broadly fall into four categories: 1.\nViolence and harassment, 2.\nObjectionable content, 3.\nCriminal behavior, and 4.\nHacking and cheating.\nIn addition, all publicly visible content, including but not limited to profile pictures, banners, team logos, profile posts, and public channel content, must be suitable for ages 13 and up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n1.\nViolence and harassment\nIncitement &amp.\npromotion of violence\n<p>You may not share content or engage

speech\n<p>You may not engage in hate speech on our services.\nWe generally adhere to the definition of hate speech as messages, media, terms, or rhetoric that attacks or promotes the attack or
