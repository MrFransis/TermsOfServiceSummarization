User Content with others or on third party social media sites.\n<br>\n<br> We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.\nWe may also use this information to communicate directly with you.\nWe may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers.\nIf you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be

afford to pay JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, VSCO will pay them for you.\nIn addition, VSCO will reimburse all such JAMS\u2019 filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.<br>\n<br> You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>11.3 Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator shall have exclusive

Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.\nThe arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and VSCO.\nThe arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable

and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of

resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 11.1 above.\nAn arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.\nHowever, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>11.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION

CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.\nIf a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection\u2019s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California.\nAll other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>11.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by
