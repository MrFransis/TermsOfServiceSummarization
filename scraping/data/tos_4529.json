REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>See our FAQS at https://corporate.pluto.tv/terms-of-use/arbitration-faq for more information.</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>19.1 Binding Arbitration and Exclusions from Arbitration.</strong>\n<p>EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW OR UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 19.5), ANY AND ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN YOU AND ANY PLUTO/VII ENTITY WILL BE RESOLVED IN BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT.\nYou and Pluto agree to submit to individual arbitration the resolution of any and all Claims by or between you and/or Pluto, except that you and Pluto agree that the following will not be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in this Section 19.1: (A) any Claim filed by you or Pluto with respect to any violation, enforcement or validity of patent, trademark, trade dress, service mark, copyright and/or trade secret rights of you, Pluto, or any third party, including, but not limited to, Claims related to content that you upload to or share on the Services and/or (B) you or Pluto may seek a preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief in any court as provided in Section 20 in connection with any Claim whereby you or Pluto, as applicable, may suffer immediate and irreparable harm for which money damages may be inadequate and impossible to calculate (including, but not limited to, a Claim under Section 19.1(A)), where such Claim under this Section 19.1(B) will not be subject to the informal dispute resolution procedures described in Section 19.2 below.\nprovided, however, that, subsequent to obtaining such preliminary injunction, restraining order or other provisional equitable relief, the Claim will then be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Section 19.\nYou and Pluto agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce, and that the enforceability of Section 19 will be governed by, construed, and enforced, both procedurally and substantively, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\nsections 1\u20139 (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nArbitration is the referral of a dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, discovery is more limited than in court, there are no class or representative proceedings, and court review of an arbitration decision is limited.\nAn arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including, but not limited to, injunctive and declaratory relief, statutory damages, and attorneys\u2019 fees).\n\u201cClaim(s)\u201d means any dispute, claim or controversy by or between you and/or Pluto relating to the Services and/or this Agreement (including, but not limited to, this Services\u2019 Privacy Policy and all Additional Terms, Rules, regulations, procedures and policies that we refer to in this Agreement), as may be modified from time-to-time, and the subject matter hereof, including, but not limited to, any contract, tort, statutory, or equity claims.</p>\n<strong>19.2 Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong>\n<p>Except with respect to Claims described in Section 19.1(B) above, before either you or Pluto pursue or participate in any Claim against the other party in arbitration or court proceedings, you or Pluto must notify the other party of the Claim in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating the arbitration or court proceeding in order to provide a reasonable opportunity to resolve the Claim.\nYou may send a written notice of your Claim to Pluto at 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Viacom Inc.\nGeneral Counsel.\nPluto may send written or electronic notice of its Claim to your email address, your account or any physical or other address Pluto has for you.\nThe notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail and set forth the relief requested so that the other party has an opportunity to adequately address the Claim.\nExcept with respect to Claims described in Section 19.1(B) above, you and Pluto agree to negotiate in good faith with each other to try to informally resolve the Claim and, if you and Pluto do not reach an informal resolution of the Claim within 60 days, then the Claim may be submitted to binding arbitration as set forth in Section 19 or court as permitted by Section 19.1.</p>\n<strong>19.3 Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.</strong>\n<p>Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules, and other information about the AAA, are available at the AAA\u2019s website at www.adr.org.\nA form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA\u2019s website (see \u201cDemand for Arbitration, Consumer Arbitration Rules\u201d, under Rules and Forms, Consumer Forms, at https://www.adr.org, but contact the AAA if you have issues locating the form) and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location described in Section 20.\nAs required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed form to Pluto, which should be sent to Pluto at the following address: 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention: Viacom Inc.\nGeneral Counsel.\nIf your Claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA Rules.\nIn all cases, you and Pluto shall exchange documents and other information that you or Pluto intend to use in the arbitration.</p>\n<p>Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to $75,000, Pluto will reimburse you for all necessary filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if you wish Pluto to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must request payment of such fees by Pluto by mail to the AAA along with your form initiating arbitration and Pluto will make arrangements to pay such fees directly to the AAA.\nIn the event the arbitrator determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse Pluto for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Pluto on your behalf.\nYou agree that Pluto shall have no obligation to pay any other fees except as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<strong>19.4 Class Action Waiver.</strong>\n<p>UNLESS YOU SUBMIT A VALID ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 19.5), YOU AND PLUTO AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nYou and Pluto expressly agree that any Claim is personal to you and Pluto, shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement), and shall in no event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.\nThe arbitrator (or court if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in Section 19.1 of this Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.\nIf a court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is unenforceable in an action between you and Pluto, then this Agreement to arbitrate will be unenforceable.\nNeither you nor Pluto consent to class arbitration.</p>\n<strong>19.5 Right to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS IN SECTIONS 19.1, 19.3 AND 19.4, YOU MUST NOTIFY PLUTO IN WRITING (THE \u201cArbitration/Class Action Waiver Opt-Out Notice\u201d), WHERE THE ARBITRATION/CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT NOTICE MEETS ALL OF THE FOLLOWING

Section 19 is governed both procedurally and substantively by the FAA, this Agreement and your use of the Services is otherwise governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the

York County, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as such additional fees or costs are determined by the arbitrator and to the maximum extent permitted by law and, upon such request, (b)(i) if you agree to such request, the arbitration shall be transferred to New York County, New York or (ii) if you do not agree to such request, Pluto shall have right to request that the arbitrator determine the location in which the arbitration shall be held.\nYou and Pluto agree that any Claim that is allowed to proceed in court as

venue in the State or Federal Courts situated in the Borough of Manhattan, New York City, State of New York.</p>\n<p>To the extent it may be applicable, you and Pluto agree to opt out from and

Policy <strong>Last Updated: July 2, 2018</strong>\n<p>\nTo review the previous Cookie Policy, please go here.<br>\nTo review Terms of Use, please go here.<br>\nTo review Privacy Policy, please go here.\n</p>\n<p>Welcome to Pluto TV.\nWe take your privacy seriously.\nPlease read this Cookie and Similar Technology Policy (\u201c<b>Cookie Policy</b>\u201d) to understand how we use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies on our website at Pluto.tv (including any subdomains, mobile and connected TV versions, the \u201cSites\u201d), how we share information they provide, and how you can control or manage your consent to the collection of data using these technologies.\n</p>\n<p>This Cookie Policy is incorporated into our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nCapitalized terms not defined here will have the definitions set forth in these agreements.</p>\n<p>We use cookies and similar technologies in the following ways and as otherwise communicated to you from time to time (subject to your consent when required by applicable laws).</p>\n<b>What are cookies and similar technologies?</b>\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that a website places on your browser.\nCookies are used by most websites for security, to learn about and improve upon how users navigate a website, or to enable various features.\nFor example, cookies can allow the website to save your password, determine whether it is your first visit to the website and how long you stayed on each page, &nbsp;determine if you were brought to the website from another website, and other similar information.\n</p>\n<p>Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags typically function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page, ad, or in an email.\nThe request for these files from a server reveals certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information.\n&nbsp;Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons) are electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information such as ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.\nWe may also use these automated technologies to collect, analyze, and correlate with other tracking technologies certain information related to the devices you use to access the Services, such as IP addresses, browser type and version, browser language, OS version, unique device identifiers, and other information about your computer(s) and/or mobile device(s), to the extent made available by your device, OS, or your chosen configuration or choices.\nIn certain cases, these technologies may be used to identify your device or browser through a common process known as \u201cdevice fingerprinting.\u201d</p>\n<p>Other tracking technologies also include locally shared objects (also known as \u2018Flash cookies,\u2019) HTML cookies, or other tracking software that stores data on your device on behalf of third parties.\nThese files may be installed through your browser or other software on your computer that is used by your browser.\nThese files may be installed by us or a third party.\nTo control the storage of data through such software, users may be required to change their preferences in the software itself, through a browser, or through the use of specialized add-ons or plugins.</p>\n<b>What is the difference between session and persistent cookies?</b>\n<p>All cookies have a time limit for which they will be stored.\nCookies are typically classified as \u201csession cookies\u201d or \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d depending on how long they will be stored.\nSession cookies remain on your browser while you are logged on to a particular website and typically \u2018expire\u2019 or are deleted from your device when or shortly after you leave the website, close the browser, or when you delete them.\nPersistent cookies remain on your device for longer periods of time, sometimes indefinitely, or until you delete them.\n</p>\n<b>How can these technologies affect my privacy?</b>\n<p>Information from cookies and similar technologies may be used to collect information about your activities over time and across sites.\nFor example, information can be aggregated and used to determine patterns of behavior on the website, or simply to store your preferences.\nSometimes however, cookies and similar technologies can be used to link information about browsing, viewing, or other uses to a single device, browser, or user, although this information is not typically correlated to information that readily identifies you.\nTo learn more about how cookies and other tracking and analytics technologies are generally used and how they can affect your privacy, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>\n<b>What cookies/technologies do you use and how do you use/share them?</b>\n<p>We use cookies and similar technologies for several important reasons.\nFirst, we use cookies for \u201cessential\u201d or \u201cfunctional\u201d purposes, meaning they enable various features of the Services.\nCertain other \u201canalytics\u201d or \u201cperformance\u201d cookies and similar technologies track how the Services are used or perform, and how users engage with the Services.\n\u201cAdvertising\u201d and \u201ctracking\u201d cookies and similar technologies are used in the process of selecting and delivering advertisements to you, and help us to continue offering our Services free of charge.</p>\n<p>Please note, the specific cookies and technologies we use are subject to change without notice.\nWe may use third-party analytics providers who use tools, such as Google Analytics, to enhance analytics on our Sites.\nSee your browser\u2019s settings menu for a list of the cookies currently in use on our Services.\nYou may contact us using the information below if you have questions about any specific cookie or other technology.</p>\n<p>We generally use the following types of cookies and similar technologies on our Services:</p>\n<i>Essential and functional cookies/technologies</i>\n<p>Our Services typically use certain cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies that enable various operations on the webpage.\nFor example, our browser-based Services request the installation of essential cookies to maintain an active session, or keep you logged in to your account.\nOur browser-based Services may similarly request the installation of a cookie for various functions, for example, if you would like your browser to remember your username or password, or stay logged in after a session has ended.\nOur use of essential technologies may occur regardless whether you have provided your consent.\nOur functional technologies may be used without your consent, or you may consent implicitly through your use of a particular feature or browser configuration.\nPlease note, if your browser does not accept cookies, these features may not work properly or your experience may suffer.\n</p>\n<i>Analytics cookies/technologies</i>\n<p>Our Services use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies to understand how users navigate our Services and the content they view.\nFor example, when you first arrive to our Sites, our Sitesmay install several session cookies that track how long you stay on each page.\nOur Services may also install persistent cookies that help us keep track of the number of returning visitors and to understand how users reach our Services.\n</p>\n<p>These cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies are generally used in order to improve the performance of our Services and to learn how users interact with the features of our Services or other services.\nThese cookies or technologies may be provided or controlled by us or our trusted third-party service providers.\nFor example, we currently work with analytics providers who provide tools that analyze usage of our Services.\nWhile some of these cookies may use unique identifiers, the data is analyzed only in the aggregate and we do not use these technologies to identify you personally.\n</p>\n<i>Advertising and targeting-related cookies/technologies</i>\n<p>Our Services also use cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies to understand, tailor, and deliver content and advertisements through our Service.\nFor example, we may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across the internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of these ads on third party websites and viewing of ads and of our content.\n</p>\n<p>This collection and ad targeting takes place both on our Services and on third-party websites that participate in the ad network, such as websites that feature advertisements delivered by the ad network.\nWe may also share information about your use of our Services with our advertising and analytics partners.\nThis process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nWe and third-party vendors, for example Google and AdRoll, use third-party technologies together to report how your ad impressions, uses of advertising services, and your interactions with these ad impressions and/or ad services are related to visits to our Services.\nSee our Privacy Policy for additional details.</p>\n<p>The information these parties collect includes information about your visits to our Sites and Services, as well as other sites and services you may use.\nWe or these third parties may augment the information collected with information provided by third parties.\nWe and the parties that operate these services may build a profile of you containing this information, create or link your information to a profile or unique ID, and may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.\nThese third-party tracking technologies allow us and these providers to better inform, optimize and deliver advertisements that are personalized to your preferences and individual profile.\n.\n</p>\n<p>These technologies may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you purchase a good or service you were shown in an advertisement.\nIn some cases, these technologies may be used to develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person to which a company wants to advertise, whether and how ads you see are effective, and may also be used to augment your profile with information derived from these observations.</p>\n<b>What are my choices regarding these technologies?</b>\n<p>You can control cookies, web beacons and tracking technologies or withdraw your consent to information collection in several ways.\nFirst, many browsers allow you to change the settings such that the browser will either allow or block the installation of cookies.\nYou may delete all cookies stored by your browser using your browser\u2019s privacy menu.\nThird parties may also offer you a choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for certain purposes.\n</p>\n<i>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Analytics Services</p>\n</i>\n<p>\n<i>\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google\u2019s analytic and marketing services, visit </p>\n<p>Google Analytics Terms of Use, the Google Privacy Policy, or Google Analytics Opt-out.\nTo learn more about how to

policy</b>\n<p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time.\nWe will post the most current version of this Cookie Policy with its effective date on our Services.\nYour continued use of the Services means you consent to the terms of this Cookie Policy.</p>\n<b>Contact </b>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to our
