transparency and accountability by identifying and detecting fraudulent or invalid traffic purchased through digital advertising (<strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>).</p>\n<p>Adscore provides two

Policy at any time.</p>Who We Are<p>Adscore is a software company that works with Web Traffic Processors to help them identify fraudulent traffic they may be purchasing as part of the advertising ecosystem.\nTo do this, Adscore collects and processes personal data on online users, through the Platform.\nReducing fraudulent and invalid activity increases faith in digital advertising.</p>\n<p>Adscore\u2019s disclosure of personal data is very limited, as we only temporarily process the data in order to compute statistics before discarding it.\nThe duration during which we hold the data is 1 second, and further details can be obtained by consulting the section \u201cWho we share personal data with\u201d</p>What Do You Mean By Personal Data?<p>\u201cPersonal Data\u201d is defined as any data relating to a living individual who can be identified directly from that data or indirectly in conjunction with other information.\nIt can take the form of a name or address and, now, under new data protection laws in Europe, this can extend to uniquely generated IDs, IP addresses and other \u201cunique identifiers\u201d.</p>\n<p>We cannot identify an online user by name, or find out where they live, but instead it gives us a picture of how a user interacts with an advertising campaign which we may be monitoring in order to detect fraudulent or invalid traffic.</p>Personal Data We Collect And How &amp.\nWhy We Collect ItPersonal Data We Collect<p>As part of our Services, we collect and process the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IP address;</li>\n<li>country location;</li>\n<li>cookie IDs.;</li>\n<li>HTTP header data (including Digital Property address, operating system, plug in,)..</li>\n<li>Internet connection type and speed</li>\n<li>browser type, version and capabilities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The combination of this information, with a unique identifier is personal data.\nWe do not collect and process any Special Personal Data.</p>How Do We Collect Personal Data?<p>For Traffic Verification Services, Adscore collects information about your IP address, internet connection type and speed, and browser capabilities, processes them for the duration of 1 second, and then automatically deletes them.\nBased on the collected data, Adscore aggregates statistics that will be presented to the user in a web dashboard.\nNo cookies, flash codes and other similar technologies are used, and no tracking of the visitor is performed.</p>\n<p>For Traffic Reporting Services, Adscore collects usual information

any personally identifiable information (\"PII\") (including unique user identifiers and IP addresses) gathered on sites or apps not owned by Adscore (\"Third Party Provided PII\"), except for the purpose of providing our fraud detection and prevention related services and never to create user profiles.\nWe only share Third Party Provided PII with customers receiving our fraud detection and prevention services, or as otherwise directed by the applicable customer and services providers if necessary to provide the fraud detection and prevention services to our customers.\nWe never share Third Party Provided PII collected on one customer\u2019s site with other customers.\nRetention of Third Party Provided PII is determined by the applicable customers.</p>\n<p>EU Privacy law requires us to have a \u201clawful basis\u201d for collecting and using processing data.\nWe collect this information for our legitimate interests.\nThese are two fold (a) our legitimate interest, and our
