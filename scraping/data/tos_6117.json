in the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) in order to comply with the requirements set forth in the CCPA for those businesses doing business in California and/or offer their services to California residents, including with respect to information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly

categories of California Information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address and other identifiers -- such as email address, device type, web-browser, operating system or other similar identifiers;</li>\n<li>Unique
