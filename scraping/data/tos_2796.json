Our GlassWire software does not collect or share your personal information.\n<p> Our company mission is to help people protect their privacy, data, and devices from threats.<br> GlassWire doesn't track you with ads or abuse your privacy.\n</p> Funding from GlassWire Basic, Pro, and Elite purchases allow us to make and support GlassWire.\nPlease upgrade to support privacy, security, and to unlock our premium features.\nUpgrade GlassWire <p>We are proud to be an organizational member of the EFF.</p> Privacy Frequently Asked Questions Can you see or collect my network or graph data? <p>\n<b>No.\nYour network and graph data stays on your device and is never sent to our GlassWire servers.</b> We could not see or collect your GlassWire network or graph data even under a court order because we have no access to your network or graph data.\nOur business model is to sell our premium GlassWire software, not to collect or sell your network data to advertisers.</p> Why does GlassWire\u2019s desktop software access the network? <p>GlassWire\u2019s software for desktop computers checks for software updates that may contain important security fixes along with updating its suspicious host list.\nGlassWire can block itself from accessing the network, however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and GlassWire may not alert you if you connect to a suspicious host.\nGlassWire\u2019s Android app does not ever access the network and has no suspicious host feature.</p>\n<p>When installing or uninstalling GlassWire\u2019s desktop software, our installer will contact GlassWire.com so we can know how many installs of our software have occurred.\nThis contact sends your software version number, OS version, if you\u2019ve installed GlassWire before, along with an anonymized partial IP address and anonymized machine ID to help us estimate how many users we have.</p> Why does GlassWire for Android request the \u201cphone\u201d permission? <p>The Android OS requires the \u201cphone\u201d permission for us to see your mobile phone network data.\nWithout this mobile phone permission, it\u2019s impossible for our app to graph your phone\u2019s mobile data.\nAll similar Android apps work the same way.\nYou can learn more details about this on our Blog.\nOf course GlassWire does not make phone calls with your phone and our Android app never accesses the network.</p> How does GlassWire make money? <p>We make money through sales of our software.\nIf you want to support future development of GlassWire you can purchase GlassWire here.</p> How do I clear GlassWire's history? <p>Go to the top left GlassWire menu and turn on GlassWire's \"Incognito\" feature to keep no history at all, or simply go to GlassWire's top left menu and choose \"settings\" then click \"clear\" next to the \"clear history\" menu.\nFor our Android app you can also clear your history in its settings the same way.\nPlease note we can never see your history at all because it never leaves your device.</p> I have a question or request about the EU GDPR, how can I contact you? <p>If your request concerns a purchase of our software please contact our billing company Cleverbridge directly.\nCleverbridge is compliant with the GDPR and can make any GDPR related personal information requests you need.\nThe GlassWire software does not

contain important security fixes and also updates its suspicious host list.\nGlassWire can block itself from accessing the Internet however if you do so then you may not know about important software updates and your suspicious host list may no longer be up to date.\nPlease note our suspicious host list does not come from GlassWire users.\nWe can never see your network data.\nOur mobile software does not contact GlassWire.com at all because it has no suspicious host lists and it updates through the Google Play Android store.\nGlassWire does not collect any personal information through this
