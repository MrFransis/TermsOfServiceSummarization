Action Waiver</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please read this carefully.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;It affects your rights.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer\u2019s satisfaction by contacting us at&nbsp;TOU@dailycaller.com.&nbsp.\nThis Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and THE DC.&nbsp.\nArbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.&nbsp.\nYou have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>\n<p>Please read this Provision carefully.&nbsp.\nIt provides that all Disputes between you and THE DC shall be resolved by binding arbitration.&nbsp.\nArbitration replaces the right to go to court.&nbsp.\nIn the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).&nbsp.\nExcept as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.&nbsp.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this Provision, \u201cTHE DC\u201d means THE DC and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.&nbsp.\nThe term \u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and THE DC regarding any aspect of your relationship with THE DC, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).&nbsp.\n\u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as THE DC\u2019s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>\n<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>\n<p>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</p>\n<p>For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give THE DC an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp.\nYou must commence this process by mailing written notification to&nbsp;<strong>The Daily Caller, Legal Department&nbsp;1775 Eye Street NW Suite 1150-290 Washington, DC 20006,&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>TOU@dailycaller.com.</strong>&nbsp.\nThat written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.&nbsp.\nIf THE DC does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.&nbsp.\nYou may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or THE DC may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES&nbsp;WITHIN 30 DAYS&nbsp;FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).&nbsp.\nYou may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to&nbsp;<strong>The Daily Caller, Legal Department, 1775 Eye Street NW Suite 1150-290 Washington, DC 20006,&nbsp;TOU@dailycaller.com</strong>.&nbsp.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with THE DC through arbitration.&nbsp.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with THE DC.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration (or small claims court as designated above).</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration Procedures</p>\n<p>If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or THE DC may initiate arbitration proceedings.&nbsp.\nThe American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.&nbsp.\nAll issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>\n<p>For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.\nfor Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.&nbsp.\nIn either instance, the AAA\u2019s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.&nbsp.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp.\nFor arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.&nbsp.\nThe JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.&nbsp.\nThis Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.&nbsp.\nUnder no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>\n<p>Because the Site and this Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.&nbsp.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Award \u2013 The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.&nbsp.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration \u2013 You or THE DC may initiate arbitration in either Wilmington, Delaware or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.&nbsp.\nIn the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, THE DC may transfer the arbitration to Wilmington, Delaware in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs \u2013 THE DC will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator\u2019s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.&nbsp.\nYou are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.&nbsp.\nFees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.&nbsp.\nIn addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with THE DC as provided in the section above titled \u201cPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\u201d and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Class Action Waiver</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and THE DC specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</strong>&nbsp.\nNeither you, nor any other user of the Site can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>\n<p>Jury Waiver</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and THE DC are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.&nbsp.\nIn the absence of this Provision, you and THE DC might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).&nbsp.\nExcept as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.&nbsp.\nOther rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>\n<p>Severability</p>\n<p>If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect.&nbsp.\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>\n<p>Continuation</p>\n<p>This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with THE DC or its affiliates.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if THE DC makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require THE DC to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>XV.\nGOVERNING LAW</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Agreement shall be governed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, the laws of the State of Delaware, and applicable federal laws, without regard to choice or conflict of law provisions.\nExcept for disputes
