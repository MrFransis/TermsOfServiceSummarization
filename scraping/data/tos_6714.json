or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us

the prices displayed to you for the Services you\u2019ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments (and as may change from time to time), and you authorize Hinge to charge the payment method you provide (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d).\nHinge may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if we have already requested or received payment.\nIf you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, Hinge may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a Hinge subscription.\nIn the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact Customer Service at hello@hinge.com.</p>\n<p>If your Internal Purchase

prohibited by applicable law.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Any Subsection in this Dispute Resolution Section that is prohibited by law shall not apply to the users residing in that jurisdiction, including Subsections 15b, 15c, 15d, and 15e, which shall not apply to users residing within the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland.\nThe online dispute settlement platform of the European Commission is available under http://ec.europa.eu/odr.\nHinge does not take part in dispute settlement procedures in front of a consumer arbitration entity for users residing in the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland .</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15a.\nINFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact Hinge Customer Service first so we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance.\nIf you choose to pursue a dispute, claim or controversy against Hinge, these terms will apply.\nFor purposes of this Dispute Resolution Process and Arbitration Procedures set forth in Section 15, \u201cHinge\u201d shall include our affiliates, employees, licensors, and service providers.</p>\n<p>Hinge values its relationship with you and appreciates the mutual benefit realized from informally resolving Disputes (as defined below).\nBefore formally pursuing a Dispute in arbitration or small claims court, you agree to first send a detailed notice (\u201cNotice\u201d) to Match Group Legal, P.O.\nBox 25458, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA.\nIf Hinge has a Dispute with you, Hinge agrees to first send a Notice to you at your most recent email address on file with us, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account.\nYour Notice must contain all of the following information: (1) your full name.\n(2) information that enables Hinge to identify your account, including a picture or screenshot of your profile, your address, mobile phone number, email address, and date of birth you used to register your account if any.\nand (3) a detailed description of your Dispute, including the nature and factual basis of your claim(s) and the relief you are seeking with a corresponding calculation of your alleged damages (if any).\nYou must personally sign this Notice for it to be effective.\nHinge\u2019s Notice must likewise set forth a detailed description of its Dispute, which shall include the nature and factual basis of its claim(s) and the relief it is seeking, with a corresponding calculation of our damages (if any).\nYou and Hinge agree to then negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute.\nAs part of these good faith negotiations, if Hinge requests a telephone conference with you to discuss your Dispute, you agree to personally participate, with your attorney if you\u2019re represented by counsel.\nLikewise, if you request a telephone conference to discuss Hinge\u2019s Dispute with you, Hinge agrees to have one representative participate.\nThis informal process should lead to a resolution of the Dispute.\nHowever, if the Dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of a fully completed Notice and the Parties have not otherwise mutually agreed to an extension of this informal dispute resolution time period, you or Hinge may initiate an arbitration (subject to a Party\u2019s right to elect small claims court as provided below).</p>\n<p>Completion of this informal dispute resolution is a condition precedent to filing any demand for arbitration or small claims court action.\nFailure to do so is a breach of this Agreement.\nThe statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and Hinge engage in this informal dispute resolution process.\nUnless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration provider, National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d), shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any arbitration unless the Party bringing such demand for arbitration can certify in writing that the terms and conditions of this informal dispute resolution process were fully satisfied.\nA court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this provision and to enjoin any arbitration proceeding or small claims court action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15b.\nINDIVIDUAL RELIEF: CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, YOU AND HINGE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT IN FAVOR OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT AS PROVIDED ABOVE).\nYOU AND HINGE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO FILE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE OTHER OR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS, INCLUDING ANY CURRENTLY PENDING ACTIONS AGAINST HINGE.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, CONSOLIDATED, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS.\nTHE ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD THE SAME RELIEF AVAILABLE IN COURT PROVIDED THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD FINAL RELIEF (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE OR DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FINAL RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY\u2019S CLAIM.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD FINAL RELIEF FOR, AGAINST, OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS.\nIF A COURT DETERMINES THAT ANY OF THESE PROHIBITIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH ARE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF (SUCH AS A REQUEST FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF), AND ALL APPEALS OF THAT DECISION ARE EXHAUSTED OR THE DECISION IS OTHERWISE FINAL, THEN YOU AND HINGE AGREE THAT THAT PARTICULAR CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF SHALL PROCEED IN COURT BUT SHALL BE STAYED PENDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION OF THE REMAINING CLAIMS FOR RELIEF THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT.\nIF THIS SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION (EXCEPT FOR THE JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS) SHALL BE NULL AND VOID.\nTHIS PARAGRAPH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15c.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION THROUGH ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Hinge (that is not resolved informally by Hinge Customer Service or as provided under subsection 15a above) that arises from or relates in any way to this Agreement (including any alleged breach of this Agreement), the Services, or our relationship with you (collectively, \u201cDispute\u201d), shall be exclusively resolved through BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION except as specifically provided otherwise in this Dispute Resolution Section.\n\u201cDispute\u201d as used in this Agreement shall have the broadest possible meaning and include claims that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement and claims that arise during the term of this Agreement or after the termination of this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Hinge may elect to have an individual claim heard in small claims court.\nIf the request to proceed in small claims court is made after an arbitration has been initiated but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed.\nAny controversy over the small claims court\u2019s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court.\nAll other issues (except as otherwise provided herein) are exclusively for the Arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to scope and enforceability of this Dispute Resolution Section, as well as any request to proceed in small claims court that is made after an arbitrator has been appointed.\nIf you or Hinge challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Agreement as to your Dispute.\nHowever, such court determination shall not be considered or deemed binding with respect to Hinge\u2019s other contracting parties.</p>\n<p>Any court proceeding to enforce this Dispute Resolution Section 15, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, must be commenced in accordance with Section 17.\nIn the event Dispute Resolution Section 15 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Hinge (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas.\nYou hereby irrevocably consent to those courts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction over you for such purposes and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15d.\nINDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND MASS ARBITRATION PROTOCOLS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This subsection 15d applies to Disputes that are submitted to NAM after fully completing the informal Notice and Dispute resolution process described in subsection 15a above and when no small claims court election is made by either Party.\nAny arbitration between you and Hinge shall be administered by NAM in accordance with NAM\u2019s operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (the \u201cNAM Rules\u201d) in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, as modified by this Dispute Resolution Section 15.\nFor a copy of the NAM Rules, please visit https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms or contact NAM at NAM\u2019s National Processing Center at 990 Stewart Avenue, 1st Floor, Garden City, NY 11530 and email address commercial@namadr.com.\nIf NAM is unable or unwilling to perform its duties under this Agreement, the parties shall mutually agree on an alternative administrator that will replace NAM and assume NAM\u2019s role consistent with this Agreement.\nIf the parties are unable to agree, they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an administrator that will assume NAM\u2019s duties under this Agreement.</p>\n<p>The Parties agree that the following procedures will apply to any Arbitrations initiated under this Dispute Resolution Section:</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>1.\nCommencing an Arbitration</strong>\n</u> \u2013 To initiate an arbitration, you or Hinge shall send to NAM a demand for arbitration (\u201cDemand for Arbitration\u201d) that describes the claim(s) and request for relief in detail, consistent with the requirements in this Agreement and NAM Rules.\nIf you send a Demand for Arbitration, you shall also send it to Hinge at Match Group Legal, P.O.\nBox 25458, Dallas, Texas 75225, USA, within 10 days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration to NAM.\nIf Hinge sends a Demand for Arbitration, we will also send it to your mailing address on file with us within the same 10-day period.\nIf your mailing address is unavailable, we will send it to your email address on file, or if no email address is on file, other contact information associated with your account.\nThe arbitration provider shall not accept or administer any demand for arbitration and shall administratively close any such demand for arbitration that fails to certify in writing that the Party meets the requirements of Dispute Resolution Section 15 or if either Party elects small claims court as set forth above.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>2.\nFees</strong>\n</u>\u2013 The payment of all fees shall be governed by the NAM Rules, except to the extent that the case is a part of a Mass Filing (as defined below) or the NAM fees and costs (including Arbitrator fees) paid by either Party are reallocated upon order of the Arbitrator following a determination that (a) either Party breached Section 15 of this Agreement, (b) such reallocation is called for under this Agreement, or (c) reallocation is otherwise permitted under applicable law.\nUpon a showing to Hinge of your financial hardship we will consider a good faith request made by you to pay your portion of the applicable consumer portion of the filing fee.\nHinge is committed to ensuring that arbitration costs to consumers do not serve as a barrier to the adjudication of disputes.\nIf Hinge initiates an arbitration against you, we shall pay all fees.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>3.\nThe Arbitrator</strong>\n</u> \u2013 The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator (the \u201cClaim Arbitrator\u201d), as assisted by any Process Arbitrator appointed under NAM Rules.\n(The term \u201cArbitrator\u201d applies to both the Claim Arbitrator and the Process Arbitrator).\nIf a hearing is elected by either Party, the Arbitrator shall be in or close to the location in which you reside.\nThe Arbitrator is bound by and shall adhere to this Agreement.\nIn the event NAM Rules conflict with this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.\nIf the Arbitrator determines that strict application of any term of Section 15 of this Agreement (except for the small claims election, which shall be determined by the small claims court) would result in a fundamentally unfair arbitration (the \u201cUnfair Term\u201d), then the Arbitrator shall have authority to modify the Unfair Term to the extent necessary to ensure a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the Terms of Use (the \u201cModified Term\u201d).\nIn determining the substance of a Modified Term, the Arbitrator shall select a term that comes closest to expressing the intention of the Unfair Term.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>4.\nDispositive Motions</strong>\n</u>\u2013 The Parties agree that the Claim Arbitrator shall have the authority to consider dispositive motions without an oral evidentiary hearing.\nDispositive motions may be requested under the following circumstances: (a) within 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator\u2019s appointment, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion based upon the pleadings.\nand (b) no later than 30 days prior to the evidentiary hearing, a Party may request to file a dispositive motion for summary judgment based upon the Parties\u2019 pleadings and the evidence submitted.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>5.\nDiscovery</strong>\n</u>\u2013Each Party may (a) serve up to five requests for relevant, non-privileged documents from the other Party.\nand (b) request that the other Party provide verified responses to no more than 5 relevant interrogatories (including subparts).\nUnless both Parties agree otherwise, no other forms of discovery (including depositions) may be utilized.\nAny such discovery requests must be served on the other Party within 21 days after the Claim Arbitrator\u2019s appointment.\nThe responding Party shall provide the requesting Party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, responses signed by the Party themselves to the requested interrogatories, and/or any objections to the requests within 30 days after receipt of the requests, or, in the event of an objection to any discovery request, 30 days after the Claim Arbitrator resolves the dispute.\nIn the event either Party requests that the Claim Arbitrator consider a dispositive motion on the pleadings, such written discovery response deadlines shall be extended until 30 days following the Claim Arbitrator\u2019s final decision on such dispositive motion.\nAny disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the Claim Arbitrator for resolution.\nIn ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the Claim Arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort that would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>6.\nConfidentiality</strong>\n</u> \u2013 Upon either Party\u2019s request, the Arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either Party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>7.\nArbitration Hearing</strong>\n</u> \u2013 You and Hinge are entitled to a fair evidentiary hearing (i.e.\ntrial) before the Claim Arbitrator.\nArbitration proceedings are usually simpler, less costly, and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings.\nThe Parties agree to waive all oral hearings and instead submit all disputes to the Claim Arbitrator for an award based on written submissions and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a Party requests an oral hearing within 10 days after the Respondent files a response.\nIf an oral evidentiary hearing is requested, both Parties must be personally present at the hearing, regardless of whether either Party has retained counsel.\nBoth Parties must personally attend the hearing.\nEither Party\u2019s failure to personally attend the hearing, without a continuance ordered by the Claim Arbitrator for good cause, will result in a default judgment taken against that Party.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>8.\nArbitration Award</strong>\n</u> \u2013 Regardless of the format of the arbitration, the Claim Arbitrator shall provide a reasoned decision, in writing within 30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing is held, within 30 days after any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due.\nThe decision must clearly specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the reasons for the award.\nThe arbitration award is binding only between you and Hinge and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different Party.\nThe Claim Arbitrator may, however, choose to consider rulings from other arbitrations involving a different Party.\nThe Arbitrator may award fees and costs as provided by the NAM Rules or to the extent such fees and costs could be awarded in court.\nThis includes but is not limited to the ability of the Arbitrator to award fees and costs if the Arbitrator determines that a claim or defense is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose, for the purpose of harassment, or in bad faith.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>9.\nOffer of Settlement</strong>\n</u> \u2013 The Respondent may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer to the opposing Party any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted.\nThe amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the Claim Arbitrator until after the Claim Arbitrator issues an award on the claim.\nIf the award is issued in the opposing Party\u2019s favor and is less than the Respondent\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the Respondent\u2019s favor, the opposing Party must pay the Respondent\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees.\nIf any applicable statute or caselaw prohibits the flipping of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs that claimant may be entitled to for the cause of action under which it is suing.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<strong>10.\nMass Filing</strong>\n</u> \u2013 If, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against Hinge or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings set forth in the NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules\u201d, available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply.</p>\n<p>i.\nIf you or your counsel file a Demand for Arbitration that fits within the definition of Mass Filing referred to above, then you agree that your Demand for Arbitration shall be subject to the additional protocols set forth in this Mass Filing subsection.\nYou also acknowledge that the adjudication of your Dispute might be delayed and that any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled from the time at which the first cases are chosen to proceed until your case is chosen for a bellwether proceeding.</p>\n<p>ii.\nNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if your Dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to its Rules and this Dispute Resolution Section, to be part of a Mass Filing.\nSuch election for NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules and related fee schedule must be made by either you or Hinge in writing and submitted to NAM and all Parties.</p>\n<p>iii.\n<strong>\n<em>Bellwether Proceedings.</em> Bellwether proceedings are encouraged by courts and arbitration administrators when there are multiple disputes involving similar claims against the same or related parties.\nCounsel for the Mass Filings claimants (including you) and counsel for Hinge shall each select 15 Demands for Arbitration (30 total), and no more than 30 arbitrations shall be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending at the same time, with each of the 30 individual arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a first set of bellwether proceedings.\nDuring this time, no other Demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, adjudicated, or pending.\nIf the Parties are unable to resolve the remaining Demands for Arbitration after the first set of bellwether proceedings are arbitrated or otherwise resolved, then counsel for the Claimants and counsel for Hinge shall each select an additional 15 Demands for Arbitration (30) total to be filed, processed, and adjudicated as individual arbitrations, with each of the 30 arbitrations presided over by a different Claim Arbitrator, in a second set of bellwether proceedings.\nDuring this time, no other Demands for Arbitration that are part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated.\nThis staged process of bellwether proceedings, with each set including 30 Demands for Arbitration adjudicated on an individual basis, shall continue until each Demand included in the Mass Filings (including your Demand for Arbitration) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved.\nFees associated with a Demand for Arbitration included in the Mass Filings, including fees owed by Hinge and the claimants (including you), shall only be due after your Demand for Arbitration is chosen as part of a set of bellwether proceedings and therefore properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication.\nAny applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled beginning when you initiate the informal dispute resolution process set forth in subsection 15a of the Agreement, and if the first Mass Filings\u2019 Demands for Arbitration are chosen for the initial set of bellwether proceedings have been filed, your claims will remain tolled until your Demand for Arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.\nA court of competent jurisdiction located in a venue allowed under Section 17 of the Agreement shall have the power to enforce this subsection.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>iv.\nYou and Hinge agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of the arbitration and small claims court process and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us.\nYou and Hinge acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the fair resolution of genuine and sincere Disputes.\nThe Parties further agree that application of these Mass Filings procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15e.\nFUTURE CHANGES AND RETROACTIVE APPLICATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Dispute Resolution Section 15 applies to all Disputes between the Parties, including for any claims that accrued against you or Hinge prior to the time of your consent to this Agreement and to any claims that accrue against you or Hinge after your consent to this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you may elect to opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 15 as to claims that have accrued against you or against Hinge prior to the time of your consent to this Agreement.\nYou may opt out by sending us written notice, within 30 days of the time you consent to this Agreement, to the following email address: OptOut@hinge.co.\nPlease do not direct any customer support inquiries OptOut@hinge.co, as they will not be addressed.\nsuch inquiries should be directed to customer support at hello@hinge.co.\nYou must include information sufficient to identify your account(s), such as the email address or phone number associated with your account(s), and should include a statement that you are opting out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 15.\nPlease note: if you opt out of the retroactive application of this Dispute Resolution Section 15, you will still be subject to and bound by any Dispute Resolution Sections and Arbitration Procedures you previously agreed to, including any arbitration provisions, class action waivers, and retroactive application sections.\nAlso, regardless of whether you opt out of the retroactive application of these changes, the Parties will resolve any claims that accrue against you or Hinge after your consent to this Agreement in accordance with this Dispute Resolution Section.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nGOVERNING LAW</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Texas law and the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to any Dispute (except where prohibited by law).</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>To the fullest extent allowable by law, the laws of Texas, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict of laws rules, shall apply to any Dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or our Services.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, for users residing outside of the United States, the choice of Texas governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in the jurisdiction where you resided at the time you accepted this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Dispute Resolution Process set forth in Section 15 shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nVENUE/FORUM SELECTION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To the fullest extent allowable by law, any claims that are not arbitrated for any reason must be litigated in Dallas County, Texas (except for claims filed in small claims court, or for users residing in the EU, EEA, UK or Switzerland or another jurisdiction where prohibited by

applicable law, and except for claims that are heard in a small claims court as set forth in Section 15, any claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to our Services, or to your relationship with Hinge that for whatever reason are not required to be arbitrated or filed in small claims court, will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Dallas County, Texas, U.S.A.\nYou and Hinge consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Texas and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\nINDEMNITY BY YOU</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>You agree to indemnify Hinge if a claim is made against Hinge due to your actions.</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You

United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your information under this Privacy Policy (the \u201cdata controller\u201d) is:</p>\n<p>MTCH Technology Services Limited</p>\n<p>Hinge</p>\n<p>WeWork Charlemont Exchange</p>\n<p>42 Charlemont Street</p>\n<p>Dublin 2, D02 R593</p>\n<p>If you live outside the EEA, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, the company responsible for your information is:</p>\n<p>Hinge, Inc.</p>\n<p>809 Washington Street, Third Floor</p>\n<p>New York, NY 10014</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nWHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand Hinge.\nFor simplicity, we refer to all of these as our \u201cservices\u201d in this Privacy Policy.\nTo make it extra clear, we\u2019ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.<br>\nSome services may require their own unique privacy policy.\nIf a service has its own privacy policy, then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It goes without saying, we can\u2019t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you\u2019d like to meet.\nWe also collect information about your use of our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your profile.\nIf you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information you give us</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials and/or phone number, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>\n<li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos or audio clips.\nTo add certain content, like pictures, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.</li>\n<li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</li>\n<li>When you participate in surveys, focus groups or market studies, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</li>\n<li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</li>\n<li>If you contact us (e.g., through our customer care team or on social media), we collect the information you give us during the interaction.</li>\n<li>If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.</li>\n<li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the operation of the services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information we receive from others</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Users</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users may provide information about you as they use our services, for instance as they interact with you or if they submit a report involving you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may decide to share information with us through your social media account, for instance if you decide to create and log into your Hinge account via your social media or other account (e.g., Facebook, Google or Apple) or to upload onto our services information such as photos from one of your social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram\u2026).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Affiliates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Hinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses.\nMatch Group considers the safety and security of users a top priority.\nIf you were banned from another Match Group service, your information can be shared with us to allow us to take necessary actions, including closing your account or preventing you from creating an account on our services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Partners</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may receive information about you from our partners, where Hinge ads are published on a partner\u2019s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign\u2019s success).\nWhere legally allowed, we can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to ensure our users\u2019 safety and security.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information generated when you use our services</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>When you use our services, this generates technical data about which features you\u2019ve used, how you\u2019ve used them and the devices you use to access our services.\nSee below for more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Usage Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Using the services generates data about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., when you logged in, features you\u2019ve been using, actions taken, information shown to you, referring webpages address and ads that you interacted with) and your interactions with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, when you exchanged with them, number of messages you send and receive).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device\u2019 settings), identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify a device or browser.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Information with your Consent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude).\nThe collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren\u2019t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection.\nIf you decline permission for us to collect your precise geolocation, we will not collect it.\nSimilarly, if you consent, we may collect photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo or video or participate in streaming features on our services).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nCOOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels and SDKs) to recognize you and/or your device(s).\nYou may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them and how you can better control their use.</p>\n<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201c<strong>DNT</strong>\u201d) feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many businesses, including Hinge, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nHOW WE USE INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services.\nAdditionally, we use your info to help keep you safe, and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.\nRead on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons for which we use your information, together with practical

with customer care teams to improve our quality of service</li>\n<li>Understand how users typically use the services to improve them (for instance, we may decide to change the look and feel or even substantially modify a given feature based on how users react to it)</li>\n<li>Develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new interests-based feature further to requests received from users).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>E.\nTo prevent, detect and fight fraud and other illegal or unauthorized activities</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Find and address ongoing, suspected or alleged violations of our Terms, notably through the review of reports and interactions between members.</li>\n<li>Better understand and design countermeasures against violations of our Terms</li>\n<li>Retain data related to violations of our Terms to prevent against recurrences</li>\n<li>Enforce or exercise our rights, for example our Terms</li>\n<li>Communicate to users what

enforcement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information on how we process personal information through profiling and automated decision-making, please see our FAQ.</p>\n<p>To process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Provide our service to you:</em> The reason we process your information for purposes A and B above is to perform the contract that you have with us.\nFor instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Legitimate interests:</em> We process your information for purposes C, D and E above, based on our legitimate interest.\nFor instance, we analyze users\u2019 behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our users safe and we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a legal action.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Comply with applicable laws and regulations:</em> We process your information for purpose F above where it is necessary for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nFor example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law enforcement.\nWe also keep data evidencing consents users give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a given feature or processing.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Consent:</em> If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d in certain jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you\u2019re consenting to our processing of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nFrom time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific information such as your precise geolocation or use your information for certain specific reasons.\nIn some cases, you may withdraw your consent by adapting your settings (for instance in relation to the collection of our precise geolocation) or by deleting your content (for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d).\nIn any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nHOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users\u2019 information is, of course, with other users.\nWe also share some users\u2019 information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies for specified reasons as laid out below and, in some cases, legal authorities.\nRead on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With other users</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile).\nPlease be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you\u2019re comfortable being visible.</p>\n<p>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>\n<p>If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that you violated our Terms), we may communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With our service providers and partners</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.\nThese third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.\nWe also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services.\nFor instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.</p>\n<p>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner.\nOur service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With our affiliates</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Hinge is part of the Match Group family of businesses.</p>\n<p>We share your information with affiliates for limited legitimate purposes as laid out below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>to make all Match Group platforms safer, by making sure that when a bad actor is found on one of them (for instance on our services), it is not only addressed there (for instance by banning them), but also on the others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for them to assist us in data processing operations, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf.\nTheir assistance may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, analytics, finance and accounting assistance, improving our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>in order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities.\nWe will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse.\nExamples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we think might be interesting to you based on your profile.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>for other legitimate business purposes including corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting, where and as allowed under applicable laws.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>For corporate transactions</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With law enforcement / when required by law</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements.\n(ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law).\nor (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>To enforce legal rights</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit.\n(ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties.\n(iii) to enforce our agreements with you.\nand (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>With your consent or at your request</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties.\nIn any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances.\nWe may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see.\nWe may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.\nMore information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nCROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The sharing of information laid out in Section 6 [Deep link] involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing.\nWhen we transfer personal information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries which data protection laws have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use standard contract clauses (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism.\nWe are currently in the process of reviewing transfers to our vendors and associated legal basis further to the recent Court of Justice for the European Union\u2019s ruling on transfers of personal data to the USA.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nYOUR RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind you of the following options and tools available to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>Access / Update tools in the service</u>.\nTools and account settings can help you access, rectify or remove information that you provided to us and that\u2019s associated with your account directly within the service.\nIf you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Device permissions</u>.\nMobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone contacts, pictures, location services, push notifications and advertising identifiers.\nYou can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications.\nOf course, if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Uninstall</u>.\nYou can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.\nRemember that uninstalling an app does NOT close your account.\nTo close your account, please use the corresponding functionality on the service.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Account closure</u>.\nYou can close your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights.\nHere are a few key points to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Reviewing your information.</u> Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability, right to know or variations of those terms).\nYou can exercise this right by putting in such a request here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<u>Updating your information</u>.\nIf you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, object to or restrict its processing, please contact us here.</p>\n<p>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of someone else.\nIf you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from them through our service, the other user will have to contact us to submit a separate request for their information.\nWe may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.</p>\n<p>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.\nFor instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of age or older.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In certain countries, including in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information.\nYou can find information about your data protection regulator in the European Economic Area here, and in the United Kingdom here.\nThe data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where an alleged infringement took place.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nHOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5) and as permitted by applicable law.\nIf you decide to stop using our services, you can close your account and your profile will stop being visible to other users.\nAfter your account is closed, we will delete your personal information, as laid out below:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of three months following account closure.\nDuring this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts.\nThe retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.</li>\n<li>Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements.\nWe may also need to keep \u201ctraffic data\u201d / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations.\nWe also keep records of consents users give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and supporting data as well as imprecise location of download/purchase to support our customer care decisions, enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data in anticipation of potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent users who were banned or people who were found to be under the age of 18 from opening a new account, to ensure the safety and vital interests of our users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older.\nWe do not permit individuals under the age of 18 on our platform.\nIf you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available on the service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nJOB CANDIDATES, CONTRACTORS AND VENDOR REPRESENTATIVES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also process the personal information of our job candidates, contractors and vendor representatives, as part of our recruitment and talent management operations and our management of the services that contractors and vendors provide to us.\nIf you are a job candidate, contractor or vendor representative of Hinge, certain relevant terms of this Privacy Policy apply to our processing of your personal information, including the sections of this Privacy Policy that discuss the entity that is responsible for the processing of your personal information, transfers of personal information, rights you may have under applicable law, how to contact us and California-specific information.</p>\n<p>If you are a job applicant, the personal information we process about you may vary depending on the job you seek but typically includes what you provide to us as part of your job application as well as professional qualifications, background and reference information that recruiters or other third parties share with us.\nWe use this information to support the recruitment process, which may lead to an employment contract.\nFor contractors and vendor representatives, we may process identification information and work-related information, as necessary to manage our relationship with you and your employer, which is necessary for the performance of the services agreement, and to establish, exercise or defend potential legal claims.\nWe may share personal information with service providers that assist us with recruitment and technical data processing operations as well as with Match Group companies (for instance if you have a business relationship with employees of an affiliate).\nWe keep your personal information only as long as necessary for those purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nPRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Because we\u2019re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to make sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time.\nWe will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nHOW TO CONTACT US</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you have different options below:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you
