part of Our effort to assist in the protection of intellectual property rights, this website (\u201cSITE\u201d)\ntherefore voluntarily chooses to comply with the Notice and Takedown requirements of 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\n512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d).\nUnder that statute, We qualify as a \u201cService\nProvider.\u201d Specifically, the SITE functions as an information

Designated\nAgent is only authorized to receive DMCA Notices, and does not serve as a general agent or\nrepresentative for any other purpose, absent express authorization from Us.</b>\n</p> Abuse Notification\n<p>Abusing the DMCA Notice procedures set forth above, or misrepresenting facts\nin a DMCA Notice or Counter-notification, can result in legal liability for damages, court costs and\nattorneys\u2019 fees under U.S.\nfederal law.\nSee.\n17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(f).\nThese Notice and Takedown\nProcedures only apply to claims of copyright infringement by copyright holders and their agents \u2013 not\nto any other kind of abuse, infringement or legal claim.\nWe will investigate and take action against\nanyone abusing the DMCA notification or counter-notification procedure.\nPlease ensure that you\nmeet all of the legal qualifications before submitting a DMCA Notice to our Designated Agent.</p> Take Down Procedure\n<p>The SITE implements the following \u201cnotification and takedown\u201d procedure upon receipt of any\nnotification of claimed copyright infringement.\nThe SITE reserves the right at any time to disable\naccess to any Materials claimed to be infringing or based on facts or circumstances from which\ninfringing activity is apparent.\nAs an information location tool service provider, \u201cdisabling of access\u201d\nto material identified in a DMCA Notice shall typically mean that We remove the link to the allegedly\ninfringing content found on a third party\u2019s website, along with any affiliated linking or referential\nmaterials.\nIt is the firm policy of the SITE to terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers,\nwhen appropriate, and the SITE will act expeditiously to disable access to all material that infringes\non another\u2019s copyright, according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7512.\nThe SITE\u2019s DMCA\nNotice Procedures are set forth in the preceding paragraph.\nIf the notice does not comply with \u00a7512 of\nthe DMCA, but does comply with three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing\naccording to \u00a7512 of the DMCA, the SITE shall attempt to contact or take other reasonable steps to\ncontact the complaining party to help that party comply with the notice requirements.\nWhen the\nDesignated Agent receives a valid notice, the SITE will expeditiously disable access to the infringing\nmaterial and shall attempt to notify the user responsible for providing the content.\nThen, the affected\nuser may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement made under\npenalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed because of\nmisidentification of the material.\nAfter the Designated Agent receives the counter-notification, it will\nre-enable access to the material at issue within 10-14 days after receipt of the counter-notification\nunless the Designated Agent receives notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining\nparty seeking an injunction against the infringing activity.\nNOTE: Given that the SITE merely links to\nthird party websites, it may not be possible for the SITE to successfully locate and notify the specific\nthird party user responsible for the allegedly infringing content.\nIf the SITE is unable to notify the\nuser apparently responsible for generating the content, the SITE may instead notify the responsible\nuser care of the operator of the third party website, as the user\u2019s agent.\nThe SITE reserves the right to\nmodify, alter or add to this policy, and all users should regularly check back to these Terms and\nConditions to stay current on any such changes.</p> DMCA Counter-Notification Procedure\n<p>If the Recipient of a Notice of Claimed Infringement (\"Notice\") believes that the Notice is erroneous\nor false, and/or that allegedly infringing material has been wrongly removed, or access has been\nwrongly disabled, in accordance with the procedures outlined above, the Recipient is permitted to\nsubmit a counter-notification pursuant to Section 512(g)(2)&amp;(3) of the DMCA.\nA counter-notification\nis the proper method for the Recipient to dispute the removal or disabling of material pursuant to a\nNotice.\nThe information that a Recipient provides in a counter-notification must be accurate and\ntruthful, and the Recipient will be liable for any misrepresentations which may cause any claims to be\nbrought against the SITE relating to the actions taken in response to the counter-notification.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>To submit a counter-notification, please provide Our Designated Copyright agent the following\ninformation:</b>\n</p>\n<p>(a): a specific description of the material that was removed or disabled pursuant to the Notice;</p>\n<p>(b) a description of where the material was located within the SITE before such material was removed\nand/or disabled (preferably including specific url\u2019s associated with the material);</p>\n<p>(c) a statement reflecting the Recipient's belief that the removal or disabling of access to the material\nwas done so erroneously.\nFor convenience, the following format may be used:\n\u201cI swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the referenced material was\nremoved or disabled by the service provider as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material\nto be removed or disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p>(d) the Recipient's physical address, telephone number, and email address.\nand,</p>\n<p>(e) a statement that the Recipient consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in and for\nthe judicial district where the Recipient is located, or if the Recipient is outside of the United States,\nfor any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the Recipient will accept\nservice of process from the person who provided
