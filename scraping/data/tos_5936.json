you to the same extent as the expired card.\nIf payment is not received from your credit card issuer, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand.\nIf payment is not received as a result of an

advance via credit card.\nThis is the same credit card that is used for the monthly billing subscription purposes.\nWhen you plan and activate any campaign, your credit card will be charged for a portion of the total campaign amount, known as your Campaign Balance.\nAs your usage of the Campaign tool depletes the Campaign Balance, your card will be charged again to maintain a positive Campaign

on reasonable notice, and you may not inspect the log files for the same time period more than once.\nAny data made available to you during an inspection is Choozle\u2019s Confidential Information and you will not disclose such data to any third party or use such data for any purpose other than verifying Choozle\u2019s accounting.\nIf there is a discrepancy of more than 10 percent between the cost of inventory or data procured directly from the Choozle Platform and the parties are unable to resolve the discrepancy, Choozle is responsible for the amount of the discrepancy above 10 percent.\nYou must raise any discrepancies within 30 days of the date of the applicable campaign.\nChoozle may revise and update numbers if there is a delay in reporting affecting month-end invoicing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.10 Analytics and Insights</p>\n<p>This section applies if the Company implements the analytics code (\u201cSmart Tag Container\u201d) and tools available in the
