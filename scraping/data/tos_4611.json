in the calendar year in respect of which the cause of action first arose.\nClient acknowledges that the fees quoted herein are consideration for the stated limits of liability and the subscription

copyright, trade secret, or other proprietary right, as Client\u2019s exclusive remedy, ATSI will defend, at ATSI\u2019s expense, and will indemnify Client and hold Client harmless against any loss, cost, expense (including attorneys\u2019 fees), or liability arising out of such claim, whether or not such claim is successful.\nIn the event an injunction or order should be obtained against use of

Services not rendered and terminate this Agreement.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, ATSI will not indemnify Client to the extent that the claim arises because Client altered the System or used it outside the scope of use identified in the ATSI\u2019s user documentation.\nIn addition, ATSI will not indemnify Client to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon (i) any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material not furnished by ATSI, or (ii) any system from a third party portal or other external source that is accessible to Client within or from the System (e.g., a third-party Web page accessed via a hyperlink) or (iii) based upon the combination of any system with any products or services not provided by ATSI.\nThis section provides Client\u2019s exclusive remedy for any infringement claims or damages.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>Force Majeure.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, ATSI will be excused from performance hereunder for any period and to the extent that it is prevented from performing pursuant hereto, in whole or in part, as a result of delays caused by Client or a Force Majeure
