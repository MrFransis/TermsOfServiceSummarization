accordance with the&nbsp;Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;www.adr.org/arb_med&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration Process.\nA party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at&nbsp;www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477&nbsp;and a separate form for California residents atwww.adr.org/si.asp?id=3485.)

Rules.\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration Location and Procedure.\nUnless you and Styleforum otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Styleforum.net submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>Arbitrator\u2019s Decision.\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable

with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General </strong>\n</p>\n<p>The failure of Styleforum.net to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Styleforum.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\nIf for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contacting Styleforum </strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact Styleforum by emailing admin@styleforum.net</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Home
