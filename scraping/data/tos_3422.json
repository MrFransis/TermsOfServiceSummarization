message while you are offline that message will be stored until you get back online.</li>\n<li>Archive.\nBy default we will be keeping an archive of your messages for later retrieval by yourself.\nThis can come in handy if you log in with a new device and want access to your message history and is also required if you want to use the OMEMO encryption with multiple devices.\nYou can opt-out of this by setting your server-side archiving preferences with your XMPP client.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Files.\nEvery file you share with a contact or a conference will be uploaded and stored for later retrieval by the recipients.</li>\n<li>Other data <ul>\n<li>A list of your contacts (Roster, Buddylist).\nThis list is maintained by you.\nYou decide who goes on that list and who gets deleted.</li>\n<li>Semi public data you are publishing for your contacts to see like your avatar or the OMEMO public keys.</li>\n<li>Other private data your XMPP client might upload like a list of conference bookmarks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Offline messages, the archive (MAM) and files are stored for 90 days.\nWe reserve the right to shorten this time span to 30 days in the
