resolution\nprocedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied prior to initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other party.<br>\n<br>\n</p> Arbitration Agreement And Class Action Waiver <p>\n14.1 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Rose Web Services in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Rose Web Services agree\nthat every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral\narbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same\ndamages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in\ncontract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.\nYOU UNDERSTAND\nAND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ROSE WEB SERVICES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br>\n<br> 14.2 Despite the\nprovisions of Section 14.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims\ncourt.\n(ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law.\nor (iv)\nto file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.<br>\n<br> 14.3 Any arbitration between you and Rose Web Services will be settled under the\nFederal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of\nthe American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by\ncalling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Rose Web Services.<br>\n<br> 14.4 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the\nother party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail\n(\"Notice\").\nRose Web Services' address for Notice is: Rose Web Services LLC, 2977 Hwy K STE 252, Ofallon, MO 63368, USA.\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the\nclaim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an\nagreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Rose Web Services LLC may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any\nsettlement offer made by you or Rose Web Services must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nIf the dispute is\nfinally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Rose Web Services will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any.\n(ii) the last\nwritten settlement amount offered by Rose Web Services in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award.\nor (iii) $1,000.<br>\n<br> 14.5 If you commence arbitration in\naccordance with these Terms, Rose Web Services will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any\nfees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in St.\nLouis, Missouri, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you\nmay choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor\n(iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or\nthe relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment\nof all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Rose Web Services for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to\npay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential\nfindings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or\nexpenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.<br>\n<br> 14.6 YOU AND ROSE WEB SERVICES\nAGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE\nPROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Rose Web Services agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any\nform of a representative or class proceeding.<br>\n<br> 14.7 If Rose Web Services makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Rose Web Services'\naddress for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Rose Web Services' address for Notice, in which case your account with\nRose Web Services will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.<br>\n<br> 14.8 If Section\n14.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 14 will be null and void and, in that case,\nthe parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive\nauthority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.<br>\n<br>\n</p> Miscellaneous Provisions <p>\n15.1
