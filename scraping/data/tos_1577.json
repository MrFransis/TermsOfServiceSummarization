experience on the Site, among other things, we collect, use, and share your user information.&nbsp.\nFor example, we use aggregated information to develop content targeted to user interests and to generally improve the Site\u2019s user experience.&nbsp.\nAs detailed below, your user information may also be used by Forbes and its partners to tailor content and ads, provide social media features (e.g., features that allow you to share content directly to your preferred social media platform), track your preferences, analyze traffic, and provide similar services and content.&nbsp.\nForbes is committed to your privacy and will not share any user information with any third party without your consent, except as outlined in this Privacy Statement or as permitted by law.&nbsp.\nIf you have any requests, comments, or questions about this Privacy Statement or your user information, please contact us in the manner provided below.</p>\n<u>What this Privacy Statement Covers</u>\n<p>This Privacy Statement covers the Site.\nWhile you may encounter links on the Site to other websites, such as those relating to our third party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners (e.g., our affiliate network operators), please note that these websites are not covered by this Privacy Statement (unless otherwise noted on such site, which may be the case if, for example, the site is also owned and operated by Forbes).\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Statement does not apply to the activities of Forbes\u2019 third party sponsors, advertisers, and other partners (e.g.\nour affiliate network operators) that may collect your user information while you access or use such third party\u2019s services in connection with your use of our Site (e.g.\nsocial media and sharing services).&nbsp.\nThe privacy and information practices of those third parties are not covered by this Privacy Statement.&nbsp.\nTo learn more about such third party policies, we encourage you to read and review the privacy statements of each third party service that you may choose to use.\nThis Privacy Statement applies only to user information collected by us or shared with us in relation to our Site.\n</p>\n<p>As a general reminder, please think carefully before you decide to put anything on the internet.&nbsp.\nFor example, if you voluntarily disclose user information in chat areas or bulletin boards (e.g., comments sections), that information could be seen and used by others, and may result in unsolicited messages from others.\nWe are not responsible for the user information you may choose to submit in these public forums.\nTo request removal of your user information from our blog or community forum, please contact us as provided below.\nIn some cases, for legal retention purposes or technical limitations (e.g., the data may not be searchable), we may not be able to remove user information voluntarily disclosed by you in such forums, in which case, we will notify you.\n</p>\n<u>Gathering of Information</u>\n<p>\n<b>Section Overview</b>: We collect user information when you use the Site.&nbsp.\nSometimes you may submit it to us yourself, other times it may be collected automatically.&nbsp;You can manage and change your preferences as outlined below.</p> Information Collected <p>When you use the Site, your user information may be collected, used, and shared in a variety of manners.\nAs detailed below, the type of user information collected may vary based on how it was gathered, but may include, among other things, user information that you voluntarily submit (e.g., when setting up an account or submitting a registration or application on the Site (including when signing up for a paid subscription), you may submit your contact information, social media account handles, and/or professional information), user information automatically collected about your usage of the Site (e.g., the content that you choose to view), and user information that our third party partners may share with us if such third party partners have previously received your consent to do so.</p> Voluntary Submission <p>Forbes may collect user information (including personally identifiable information) that is voluntarily provided by you or with your permission.\nFor example, we may ask you for user information, such as your email address, when you register to become a member of the Site or register for a Forbes-produced live event.\nYou may also provide user information to Forbes in other contexts, including, for example, on your member profile page and public profile URL (for example, if you choose to add content to your profile page, such as photos, videos or other information about you and your interests), to enter into a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion, or to apply for consideration in connection with a Forbes list or similar accolade (e.g., Under 30 list applications).\n</p>\n<p>In the event you order something from the Site or one of our co-branded websites, or if you sign-up for a paid subscription (or a free trial of a paid subscription), we may request additional user information, such as your address, telephone number and credit card information, in order to complete the order.\nYou may also provide us with other information at the same time, such as your choice of subscription term or type of subscription.\nIf you choose to sign-up for a paid subscription via your social media profile (further information on this below under \"Information that We Obtain from Third Party Sources\"), we may also receive some limited information about you from that social media provider.\nWhere you sign-up for paid subscriptions as a gift option (e.g., on behalf of a friend or colleague, the gift recipient), you may provide us with this information on behalf of the gift recipient.\n</p>\n<p>You always have the option not to provide the information we request.\nIf you choose not to provide the information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be unable to access certain options and services, such as paid subscription content.\nIn the event that you wish to provide user information to us about a third party, such your friend or colleague, in connection with a referral, gift subscription, recommendation, nomination (e.g., Under 30 list nomination), or other purpose, please only do so if you have the permission of that third party.\nWhen you register or become a member of the Site or provide information to Forbes in any other manner, you agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information.</p> Information that We Collect Automatically <p>When you visit our Site, we may collect certain user information automatically from your device.\nIn some territories, including

Sources <p>From time to time, we may collect personal information about you from third party sources (including data append services such as public or social graph data, or social media websites if you have chosen to log in or connect your social media with our Site) which we will use for our business purposes (for example, in order to better serve you with content or promotions).\nHowever, we

profile on that social media platform (but only if you have made this information public in your corresponding Facebook or LinkedIn profile).\nThis will be limited to your full name, age range, profile picture (if you have one) and link to your Facebook or LinkedIn profile (as applicable).\nIf you log-in or purchase a subscription using your Google account, you give Google permission to share personal data with us that you have made public in your Google profile.\nThis will be limited to your full name, your email address (and whether your email has been validated), your age range, your profile picture (if you have one) and a link to your Google profile.\nIf you log-in or purchase a subscription using your Apple ID, you give Apple permission to share your personal data with us

account and will be used to allow you to access your subscribed content.\n</p>\n<p>We will use this information to form a profile for your account, or to enable you to purchase a paid subscription.\nIf you later remove the Site from your Facebook or LinkedIn settings, Google settings, or Apple ID, we will no longer have access to this information.\nHowever, this will not affect our ability to use the information that we already received when you first set up your account (or purchased a subscription) using that social media login, as long as we continue to need to use it for the purposes as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>\n<u>Use of Your Information</u>\n<p>\n<b>Section Overview:</b> Our primary goal in collecting, using, and sharing user information is to enhance

so.\nHowever, we do make available for rental our list of those registrants who have expressly provided us with their permission to receive third party offers as part of their user profile.\nIn those cases, your email address will be transferred to the third party.\nYou can remove your consent to this use or modify your related user information by contacting Forbes as indicated

purpose.\nWe will not share the user information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.</p>\n<p>As noted above, you may be able to log in to our site using sign-in services that bridge your social media login information with the Site.\nThese services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain user information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form or subscription order.\nThese services give you the option to post information about your activities on the Site to your profile page to share with others within your network.\nThe Site includes social media features, widgets and/or interactive mini-programs that run on the Site.\nThese features are small content modules that can be embedded on the Site (or other sites) and may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Site, or set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>\n<p>We offer widgets that are hosted on the Site, like our embeddable video player.\nUse of the Forbes.com widgets is subject to the Site terms of use, but downloading or embedding these widgets on other websites is not covered by this privacy statement.</p> Aggregate Information with Advertisers <p>Forbes derives the majority of its revenue on the Site from advertising and sharing information is essential to keeping our services affordable to users.\nIn order to attract and retain advertisers, we use the aggregated, information that we gather (as well as aggregated information from third-party market researchers) to describe our services to partners and to assist our advertisers and sponsors to better understand our audience.\n</p>\n<p>We partner with third

activities on the Site and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.</p>\n<p>If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out or modify your choices by clicking here, if you are a California resident, by clicking the \u201cCookies on Forbes\u201d tab or, if located in the Europe or, by clicking

companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of newsletter mailings, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services.\nWe will only provide those companies the user information they need to deliver the service.\nIn some instances, these companies may collect user information directly from you.\nIn these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the external service provider.\nIn all cases, these companies are subject to agreements that require them to maintain the confidentiality of your user information and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p> In the Event of Sale or Bankruptcy <p>The ownership of the Site may change at some point in the future.\nShould that occur, we want this site to be able to maintain a relationship with you.\nIn the event of an (actual or potential) sale, merger, public offering, bankruptcy, acquisition of any part of our business, or other change in control of Forbes, your user information may be shared with the person or business that owns or controls (or potentially will own or control) this Site,
