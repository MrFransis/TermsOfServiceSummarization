you for your interest in using the online services operated by DeltaMath (\"DeltaMath\", \"we\" or \"us\").\nThese Terms of Service (\"Terms\" or \"Agreement\") govern your use of DeltaMath's online services (the \"Services\").\nPlease continue reading to learn about the terms by which you may use our Services.</p>\n<p>These Terms apply to all schools, school districts, or teachers (collectively referred to as \"Schools\") as well as students and parents, who use the Services.\n(collectively along with \"Schools\" referred to as \u201cUsers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d).</p>\n<p>By accessing or using the Services, creating an account, or by otherwise affirmatively stating your desire to use the Services, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the DeltaMath Privacy Policy, otherwise you may not use the Services.\nBecause our Services change relatively often, the terms in this Agreement and our Privacy Policy may change too.\nUpon making changes, we will update the \u201cEffective Date\u201d found at the top of this page.\nYour continued use of the Services after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>DeltaMath's Service<p>DeltaMath is an online math practice and learning site.\nStudents will register with a teacher code and complete assignments made by their teacher.</p>\n<p>As long as you are complying with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, DeltaMath gives you permission to access and use the Service.\nThe Service is available for your personal, noncommercial use.\nWe are constantly changing and improving our Services.\nWe may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether, including, for example, if you do not comply with this Agreement or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.\nWe may also stop providing Service to you, or add or create new limits to our Service or restrict your access to all or part of the Service at any time without notice or liability.</p>\n<p>In particular, individual teacher licenses, paid or unpaid, are intended for single-teacher use, with exceptions in the case of support teachers.\nWe reserve the right to reach out to end-users and/or revoke access in cases where it appears more than one teacher is using an account without our prior consent.</p>\n<p>The right to access and use the Service is revoked in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited, if any.</p>Personal Information and Student Data<p>The U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) requires that online service providers obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children under 13.\nIf you are a School providing the Service to children under 13 (whether in the U.S.\nor elsewhere), you represent and warrant that you have received consent from parents, or have the authority to provide consent on behalf of parents, for us to collect information from students before allowing children under 13 to access DeltaMath Services.\nWe recommend that all Schools provide appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding their use of service providers such as DeltaMath.</p>\n<p>When DeltaMath is used by a School for an educational purpose, DeltaMath may collect or have access to Student Data that is provided by the School or by the Student.\n\u201cStudent Data\u201d is personal information that is directly related to an identifiable Student and may include \u201ceducational records\u201d as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), 20 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1232(g).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Confidentiality</b>.\nDeltaMath agrees to treat Student Data as confidential and not to share it with third parties other than as described in these Terms, and in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Student Data Access</b>.\nYou authorize DeltaMath to access or collect Student Data for the purpose of providing the Service.\nIn the U.S., DeltaMath shall collect and process Student Data as a School Official with a legitimate educational interest pursuant to FERPA 34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(1).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Personal Information and Student Data Consents and Authority.</b>If you are School User, you represent and warrant that you have provided appropriate disclosures to your School and to parents regarding your sharing such Personal Information with DeltaMath.\nBoth Parties agree to uphold their obligations under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (\"PPRA\"), and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act (\u201cCOPPA\u201d) and applicable State laws relating to student data privacy.\nDeltaMath relies on each School to obtain and provide appropriate consent and disclosures, if necessary, for DeltaMath to collect any Student Data, including the collection of Student Data directly from students under 13, as permitted under COPPA.\nYou agree to comply with these Terms and all laws and regulations governing the protection of personal information, including children\u2019s information, and the sharing of student education records.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of Student Data.</b> By submitting or providing us access to Student Data, you agree that DeltaMath may use the Student Data solely for the purposes of (i) providing the Service, (ii) improving and developing our Service, (iii) enforcing our rights under these Terms, and (iv) as permitted with the School\u2019s or the User\u2019s consent.\nDeltaMath shall not use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of Anonymized Student Data.</b> You agree that we may collect and use data derived from Student Data for our own purposes, such as for product development, research analytics, and marketing our Service, provided that such data will be de-identified and/or aggregated to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use of Personal Information for Marketing.</b> You agree that DeltaMath may provide information about new DeltaMath features and offerings to school or district administrative users and teachers from time to time, provided that such advertisements shall not be based on Student Data.\nFor emphasis, and without limitation, DeltaMath shall never use Student Data to engage in targeted advertising, nor shall DeltaMath direct advertising to student users.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Third-Party Service Providers.</b> You acknowledge and agree that DeltaMath may provide access to Student Data to our employees and service providers, which have a legitimate need to access such information in order to provide their services to us.\nWe and our employees, affiliates, service providers, or agents involved in the handling, transmittal, and processing of Student Data will be required to maintain the confidentiality of such data.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Student Data Retention and Deletion Requests.</b>DeltaMath retains Student Data, but for educational purposes only.\nOftentimes students will want to refer back to their DeltaMath student accounts for college or other future courses.\nHowever, if a student does not utilize their account for a period of two years, their account and personally identifiable information will be deleted.\nAdditionally, Schools may request that we delete Student Data in our possession at any time by providing such a request in writing.\nWe shall respond to the deletion request as soon as possible, but in most instances within 45 days, other than for data stored on backup tapes which shall be deleted in the ordinary course of business.\nA Parent seeking to modify, correct, or delete personal information in a Student Account that is connected to an active School account will be instructed to contact the School to discuss data deletion or modification.\nWe are not required to delete data that has been derived from Student Data so long as it has been anonymized such that it does not reasonably identify an individual.</p>Use

"updated_at": "2021-08-18 00:59:34.04001"}, {"id": 8737, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://www.deltamath.com/privacy-policy/", "xpath": "/html/body/div[1]/div[1]/div/div[2]", "text": "<p>Effective Date: November 14, 2020</p>\n<p>DeltaMath (\u201cwe\u201d or \u201cDeltaMath\u201d) is committed to protecting the privacy of teachers and students.\nThis Privacy Policy will explain (i) what information DeltaMath collects from you and why we collect it, (ii) how we use and share that information, and (iii) the choices you have, including how to access, update and delete your information.</p>How we Collect and Use Information<p>\n<b>Teacher Registration and Class Setup:</b> We ask for certain information when a teacher registers with DeltaMath.\nTeachers must provide a school name and address where they currently teach and also their full name and salutation.\nThis information will be shown to students when they register so they are confident they are registering for the correct class.\nTeachers must also provide an email address and password.\nThe email and password are used for login purposes to protect student data that only teachers have access to.\nThe email address may also be used to send infrequent updates about DeltaMath.\nThe teachers must also provide information about the classes they are teaching.\nThis allows the teacher to create assignments on a per class basis and the students will select the correct section from a dropdown box when they register for the class.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Student Registration:</b> Students may only sign up for a DeltaMath account with a valid teacher code from a registered DeltaMath teacher.\nThe students are given the teacher code and the students are responsible for creating their own account.\nStudents must enter their full name, email address, password and select the correct class section when creating the account.\nThe email addresses are used for a unique login as well as password recovery initiated by the student.\nIn order to improve privacy, there is an option in the teacher \"Tools\" that allows email addresses to <i>not</i> be used during registration.\nIn this case, the teacher could assign non personally identifiable usernames and nicknames in order to increase student anonymity.\nThe only users that will be able to see the student personally identifiable information are the teachers for whom the student has registered.\nThe student's teachers are <i>not</i> able to see their students' passwords, but the teacher is able to reset the password of a student in the event that a student has forgotten their password.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Assignment Data:</b> The primary purpose of DeltaMath is for teachers to put up assignments and for students to complete them.\nTeachers will create assignments, specifying relevant math problems for students to complete.\nTeachers have the opportunity to share their assignments with all DeltaMath users, but the default is that all assignments created are private.\nStudents will complete the assignments and data will be collected regarding student progress.\nThis data includes which problems where attempted, the time at which each problem was attempted, the answers the student submitted and whether they were correct, the duration the student was working on each problem, whether each assignment was completed on time and the completion percentage for each assignment.\nSome problems have corresponding videos and data is collected on whether the student watched the videos and for how long.\nIf the teacher decides to assign a \"Test Correction\" assignment, the students are required to enter in their grade on the given test or quiz and input which questions they got wrong in order for a customized assignment to be made for the student.\nAll of this data is available to the student's teacher(s) in order to use the information for student accountability purposes or to inform their instruction.\nThe information is also available to all future, past and concurrent teachers added by the student in order for each teacher to understand their students' strengths and weaknesses to the fullest extent.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Automatically Collected Data:</b> We automatically collect certain technical usage information when you use the DeltaMath Services (\u201cUsage Data\u201d).\nUsage Data includes the information that your web browser or mobile application automatically sends to our servers whenever you visit.\nThe Usage Data collected in our logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, operating system, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, click history, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and whether you opened an email.\nTypically, this information is collected through log files, web beacons, browser cookies, or other device identifiers that may uniquely identify your browser or device.\nTeachers are able to see the IP addresses of their students for any given problem solved in order to ensure that multiple accounts are not signing in from the same computer possibly indicating one student is signing into another student's account to complete work under a false identity.\nIn addition, the DeltaMath Services may use third party analytics and bug tracking software (including, without limitation, Google Analytics) to collect further Usage Data regarding the online usage patterns of our users and bugs in our Services.\nWe may combine Usage Data with Personal Data in a manner that enables us to trace Usage Data to an individual user.\nWe do not permit third party advertising networks or other third parties to collect information about your browsing behavior from our website for advertising purposes.</p>How we Share Your Information<p>DeltaMath does not sell or rent any of your, or your child\u2019s, personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes.\nTargeted advertising is not permitted on DeltaMath.\nWe use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best DeltaMath experience.\nMore specifically, this information is used to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features</li>\n<li>Respond to your requests for information or customer support</li>\n<li>Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it</li>\n<li>Send you information about new features and DeltaMath products we believe you may be interested in</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use automatically collected information (described in the \u201cAutomatically Collected Data\u201d section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Service Providers:</b> Targeted advertising is not permitted on DeltaMath.\nWe do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf.\nWe may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, and security.\nGenerally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\nAdditionally, these service providers must adhere to the same standards of data privacy and security as those detailed herein, particularly with regard to protected personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Analytics Services:</b> We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used.\nThese services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:</b> We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how DeltaMath is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for DeltaMath.\nAny aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Legal Requirements:</b> We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.\nWe may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of DeltaMath, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.\nThis includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Sharing with DeltaMath Companies:</b> Over time, DeltaMath may grow and reorganize.\nWe may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Change of Control:</b> If we sell, divest or transfer DeltaMath or a portion of DeltaMath, we will not transfer Student personal information without first giving you the ability to opt-out of the transfer by deleting your account, unless the new owner intends to maintain and provide the Service as a going concern, and provided that the new owner has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.\nWe may also transfer personal information \u2013 under the same conditions \u2013 in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business.</p>How we Store and Protect Your Information<p>\n<b>Storage and Processing:</b> Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States.\nIf you use our Service outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Keeping Information Safe:</b> DeltaMath maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States.\nWe use highly rated hosting providers with onsite 24-hour security and teams of experts dedicated to monitoring network security.\nAccess to information is limited through user/password credentials by the administrator of the website only.\nWhen you enter any information anywhere on the Service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL/TLS) by default.\nWe ensure passwords are stored and transferred securely using encryption, salted hashing and key stretching to prevent brute force password cracking.</p>\n<p>Although we make concerted good faith efforts to maintain the security of personal information, and we work hard to ensure the integrity and security of our systems, no practices are 100% immune, and we can\u2019t guarantee the security of information.\nOutages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.\nIf we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws) so that you can take appropriate protective steps.\nfor example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.deltamath.com) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us.</p>How to Update or Delete Your Information<p>\n<b>Account Information and Settings:</b> Schools and students may update account information, such as email, password and name, by signing into their account and clicking \"Tools\".\nSchools and other website users can opt-out of receiving promotional email from us by clicking on the \"unsubscribe\" feature at the bottom of each any email sent to them.\nTeachers may change a password or alter a name of any student account who has added the teacher code of that teacher to their student account.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying account information, contact us directly at info@deltamath.com.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Deleting Your Account and Information:</b> If you would like to delete your account and information from the site, please contact info@deltamath.com and your request will be honored within a reasonable amount of time.\nThe request should be made from the email address associated with the account to ensure it is a legitimate request.\nIf you are a student or a parent of a student of an active School account, the request must be made by the School as an intermediary in order to give the School ample chance to download information from the site that may be used for legitimate educational purposes.\nWe may maintain anonymized, aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes.</p>Children's Privacy<p>DeltaMath does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless and until the School has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service.\nBecause DeltaMath collects and uses Student Data at the direction of and under the control of a School, DeltaMath relies on each School to provide appropriate notice to parents of the School's use of third party service providers such as DeltaMath, and for the Schools to provide consent, if necessary, and authorization for DeltaMath to collect Student Data, as permitted by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).\nPlease contact us at info@deltamath.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper consent so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.</p>Changes and Updates<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected in the \u201cEffective Date\u201d at the top of this page.\nYour continued use of the DeltaMath Services following such update constitutes your agreement to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>", "created_at": "2021-08-18 02:58:37.881965",
