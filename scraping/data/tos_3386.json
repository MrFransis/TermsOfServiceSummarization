send me crash dumps.\nInteraction with Instagram is minimized, but you still need to agree to their privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Note</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The summary and headings are added for ease of reading and should not be considered as parts of this privacy policy.</li>\n<li>This Privacy Policy only applies to v19.0 and later, as it is modified to reflect functionality changes.\nGenerally, older version is subject to the same policy with some changes, but the spirit is the same.\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask me.</li>\n</ol> Declaration\n<ul>\n<li>The app does not, and will not, collect data, unless operationally necessary.</li>\n<li>The app does not, and will not, share data, unless either operationally necessary (Interaction with Instagram) or with voluntary consent (Logs, as well as third-party services).</li>\n<li>The app does not, and will not, have features that allows monetization.\n(I accept donations, but without perks, and it's separate from the app.)</li>\n</ul>\nScope\n<ul>\n<li>This Privacy Policy (\"Policy\" or \"the Policy\" thereafter) applies to version 19.0 and later.</li>\n<li>The Policy does not apply to any forks of this app (should there be), but their implementation of this Policy is strongly encouraged.</li>\n<li>The Policy does not apply to any services around the app (Documentation, GitHub, Crowdin, Telegram...) either.</li>\n</ul>\nFirst Party\nCrash dumps\n<ul>\n<li>Crash dumps are stored locally on your device, until you choose to send it (Through the \"Report\" button on crash).</li>\n<li>These may contain personal information (Device model, app version, what action you're trying to do...), and it is your sole responsibility to redact them as necessary.</li>\n<li>If you choose to send them, these information will only be used to improve the app, and you consent to further communication about your report.</li>\n<li>If you email your crash report to barinsta@austinhuang.me (default address), your email address will be published along with your crash report, but you may withdraw consent by contacting im@austinhuang.me.</li>\n</ul>\nPreferences\n<p>Preferences are stored locally.\nThe cookie (if logged in) is shared with Instagram to authenticate, otherwise they are not used outside the app.\nYou can explicitly choose to export it, however the file will be under your sole responsibility.</p>\nThird Party\nInteraction with Instagram\n<p>Interaction with Instagram is minimized:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The app will request content that you explicitly want to be displayed, for example: If you want to see posts, then they are requested from Instagram.</li>\n<li>Your language preference (within the app) and your timezone is sent to Instagram (since they do affect content display).\nOther personal details, including and not limited to phone details, call logs, contacts, how-long-you've-read-a-post, battery level, etc, are not sent.</li>\n<li>The app will send data that you explicitly want to be sent.\nFor example: If you like/comment on posts, Instagram is informed of your action.</li>\n<li>The app will not voluntarily make requests (such as mark-as-seen) for you without your explicit consent.</li>\n<li>However, since we do send requests, your usage of this app still constitutes your acceptance of Instagram's Data Policy.</li>\n</ul>\nOptional third-party providers\n<p>This section is only valid before v19.0.4, inclusive.</p>\n<p>For anonymous users: Should you choose to use one of the third-party providers proposed to you in Settings, you accept their Privacy Policy.\nInteraction with them is minimized as if the app is interacting with Instagram itself.</p>\nConclusion\n<p>Reminder: This app is open source and these statements can be easily audited.</p> Previous <b>Reach over 7 million devs</b> each month when you advertise with Read the Docs.<small>\n<em>Sponsored \u00b7 Ads served ethically</em>\n</small>\n<p>Documentation: Copyright
