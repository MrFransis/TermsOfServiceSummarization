A <u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</u>, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.\nTHIS AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A <u>JURY WAIVER</u>.</p>\n<p>It is Toyota's goal that the Sites meet your expectations and that you are satisfied.\nHowever, there may be instances when you have a problem or dispute that needs special attention.\nIn those instances, Toyota is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that satisfies you.\nhowever, we can only do this if we know about and understand your issue.\nTherefore, for any problem or dispute that you may have with Toyota, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give Toyota an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute.\nThis includes you first sending a written description of your problem or dispute to Toyota Motor North America, c/o Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., Toyota Customer Experience Center, P.O.\nBox 259001 \u2013 Web Services, Plano, TX 75025-9001.\nYou then agree to negotiate with Toyota in good faith about your problem or dispute.\nThis should lead to resolution, but if for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after Toyota's receipt of your written description of it, you agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.</p>\n<p>You agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for any and all disputes and claims that cannot be resolved informally and that relate in any way to or arise out of your use of any of the Sites and these Terms shall be final and binding arbitration, except to the extent that you have in any manner infringed upon or violated or threatened to infringe upon or violate any of the Toyota Entities' or any third party patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, privacy or publicity rights, in which case you acknowledge that there is no adequate remedy at law and that injunctive or other appropriate relief may be sought by the Toyota Entities and/or the applicable third party(ies) either in court or from an arbitrator.\nYou and we acknowledge that the Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to arbitrations under the Agreement (despite any other choice of law provision).\nTo the extent that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law do not supply substantive law necessary for the resolution of any disputes or claims, the laws of the State of Texas shall apply, except that Texas laws concerning choice of law or conflict of laws shall not apply if they would cause the substantive law of another jurisdiction to apply.\nTo the extent that the parties litigate any part of any dispute or claim in court, including, without limitation, obtaining provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, confirmation of the award, and judgment enforcement, the laws of the State of Texas shall apply, except that Texas laws concerning choice of law or conflict of laws shall not apply if they would cause the substantive law of another jurisdiction to apply.</p>\n<p>Arbitration under this Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nThe arbitration shall be administered by AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nIf the arbitration results in an award, then judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThis clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\n<b>You and we agree to pay our own fees, costs, and expenses, including those for any attorneys, experts, and witnesses.</b> You agree that any claim for or award of attorneys' fees, including such claim or award pursuant of Chapter 38 of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is waived.\nAn arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief.\nAs a limited exception to the agreement to arbitrate, you and we agree that you may take claims to small claims court, if your claims qualify for hearing by such court.</p>\n<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER VISITOR OF THE SITES, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED.\nIn the event that this <b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b> is deemed unenforceable, then any putative class action may only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.</p>\n<p>WE BOTH AGREE THAT, WHETHER ANY CLAIM IS IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT, YOU AND TOYOTA BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL INVOLVING ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES BETWEEN US.<br> In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you related in any way to this Agreement be instituted more than two (2) years after the cause of action arose.</p> 19.\nCONTACT
