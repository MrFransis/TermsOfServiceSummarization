personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t store personal information on our servers unless required for the

non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers, apps and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, geographical location, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\ntawk.to\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how tawk.to\u2019s visitors use its services, and to provide tawk.to users the ability to understand how their visitors use their services.\nFrom time to time, tawk.to may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its services.</p>\n<p>tawk.to also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users that use the services and visitors.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Gathering and Use of Personally-Identifying Information</b>\n</p>\n<p>Certain visitors to tawk.to\u2019s websites and users of tawk.to\u2019s apps choose to interact with tawk.to in ways that require tawk.to to gather personally-identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that tawk.to gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.\nFor example, we ask users of our app to provide an email address.\nIn each case, tawk.to collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction with tawk.to.\ntawk.to does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\nAnd visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,

the purposes outlined in this Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\nFor personal information that we process on behalf of our customers, we will retain such personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Types of personal data we collect and use</b>\n</p>\n<p>We will only process personal data in ways that are compatible with the purpose we collected it for, or for the purposes you later authorize.\nBefore we use your personal data for a
