of the lesser of (i) DOSH representing the equivalent of $4.99 USD, or (ii) the DOSH balance then reflected in your Account (the \u201cInactive Account Rewards Deduction\u201d).\nThe Inactive Account Reward Deduction shall be assessed each consecutive month that the Account remains Inactive.\n\u201cInactive\u201d is defined as failing to either complete an eligible transaction or redeem DOSH from your Account in the trailing twelve (12)-month period.\nEach time you complete an eligible transaction or redeem DOSH from your Account, you will reset the twelve (12)-month period by which we measure

DOSH<br>\n<br>Subject to these Terms, we will automatically provide DOSH to you when you purchase qualifying goods or services with your Payment Card or perform other qualifying actions identified by us.\nThe Company, in its sole discretion, establishes the terms and conditions for each qualifying purchase or action and determines whether you have satisfied such terms and conditions to receive DOSH.\nSuch terms and conditions are set forth on the Website and the Application and may be updated, modified, suspended, or cancelled by the Company at any time in its sole discretion.\nAll offers made available to you through the Application are temporary and may become unavailable without notice.\nYou may also have a limited, prescribed window of time to take advantage of an offer.\nAlways check the Application for offers currently available to you.<br>\n<br>Not all qualifying purchases made with your Payment Card may be eligible for DOSH if we are unable to obtain certain transaction information from the Payment Card Network associated with your Payment Card.\nFor example, we may be unable to obtain certain transaction information from the Payment Card Network (and you may therefore be unable to receive DOSH) for the following transactions made with your Payment Card: (i) purchases that require you to enter your Personal Identification Number (\u201cPIN\u201d) for your Payment Card, (ii) purchases you initiate through identification technology that substitutes for a PIN, (iii) payments made through other payment methods (such as a digital wallet or a third-party payment application, where you may choose your Payment Card as a funding source but you do not present your Payment Card directly to the merchant), (iv) payments of existing balances, balance transfers, or (v) transactions that are not processed or submitted through the Payment Card Network.\nDo not use a PIN when paying for a qualifying purchase with your Payment Card if you want the purchase to be eligible for DOSH.<br>\n<br>Without limiting any of the other terms of these Terms, if you return, charge back, cancel, dispute, or otherwise request a refund for a qualifying purchase for which you have already received DOSH, we will reduce the balance of DOSH in your Account by the amount of DOSH you received for such transaction.\nIf the balance of DOSH in your Account is less than the amount of DOSH you received for such transaction, we will offset the applicable amount of DOSH from DOSH you would otherwise receive for future qualifying actions.<br>\n<br>DOSH that you receive as a result of a qualifying physical purchase at a participating merchant will generally be reflected in your Account within 1-7 Business Days after the date of purchase.\nDOSH that you receive as a result of a qualifying online purchase at a participating merchant will be reflected in your Account after the return period for the purchase has expired and generally within 60-90 Business Days after the online purchase is completed.\nDOSH that you receive for a travel-related purchase will be reflected in your Account between 30-60 Business Days after check out.\nIn some cases, it may take longer for DOSH to be reflected in your Account.\nFor purposes of these Terms, \u201cBusiness Day\u201d means Monday through Friday, excluding federal banking holidays.\n&nbsp;If you do not automatically receive DOSH for purchasing qualifying goods or services with your Payment Card or for performing other qualifying actions as identified by us, you have thirty (30) days from the date of transaction if made in store or ninety (90) days from the date of transaction if made online to contact us, provide evidence of the purchase and request DOSH earned.\nAny requests for DOSH earned after these deadlines will not be honored and the DOSH associated with the transaction will be forfeited.<br>\n<br>Without limiting any of the other conditions of these Terms, if we award DOSH to you in error (e.g., we later determine that you did not comply with the terms and conditions of a qualifying purchase or if you charge back a qualifying purchase), we reserve the right to remove the applicable DOSH from your Account.\nYou are responsible for making sure the DOSH balance reflected in your Account is correct.\nIf you believe that your Account does not accurately reflect DOSH that you are eligible to receive, please contact us.<br>\n<br>DOSH will remain in your Account until we approve redemption of DOSH as described below.<br>\n<br>(e) Redeeming DOSH<br>\n<br>Subject to these Terms and our approval, you may request that we redeem DOSH from your Account.\nUpon redemption 1 DOSH will equal $1 USD (\u201cReward Redemption\u201d).\nPrior to redeeming DOSH, (i) you must verify an email address associated with your Account, (ii) DOSH may only be redeemed from your Account through the Website or the Application, (iii) the value of the balance of DOSH in your Account must be equivalent to a Reward Redemption amount of at least $25 USD, and (iv) you must have completed an offer-qualifying transaction with a participating merchant.\nWe will generally redeem DOSH from your Account and credit the corresponding Reward Redemption amount to your designated U.S.\nbank account, PayPal account, or other payment method permitted by us and designated by you (\u201cRedemption Method\u201d) within 1-5 Business Day(s) of when we receive your redemption request.\nCredits to your bank account will be completed within 2-3 Business Days from when we receive the redemption request.\nCredits to your PayPal account may be completed on the same day we receive the redemption request or up to 5 Business Days after your Reward Redemption request is received and approved by us.<br>\n<br>We use Cash Flow Solutions, Inc.\n(\u201cCFSI\u201d) and Plaid Technologies, Inc.\n(\u201cPlaid\u201d) to gather users\u2019 data from financial institutions.\nBy using the Services, you grant us, CFSI, and Plaid the right, power and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution.\nYou agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored and processed by CFSI and Plaid in accordance with the CFSI Privacy Policy and Plaid Privacy Policy.\nBy redeeming DOSH from your Account, you authorize us to electronically credit your Redemption Method for the applicable Reward Redemption amount.\nThis authorization will remain in full force and effect until the termination of your Account or until you otherwise notify us by contacting us.\nYou must notify us of any change in your Redemption Method at least 3 Business Days before any such change by contacting us or by updating your Account.\nIf we do not receive notice at least 3 Business Days before any such change, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to implement such change prior to any credit transaction performed hereunder.\nHowever, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so.<br>\n<br>You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy and completeness of any credits of the Reward Redemption amount to your Redemption Method performed by us hereunder.\nYou must notify us of any errors within 15 days of such information being made available to you.\nIf you do not notify us of any such errors within such 15 days, you will forfeit the right to contest a transaction, except to the extent such forfeiture is prohibited by applicable law.<br>\n<br>For example, unless otherwise permitted by us, you may only redeem DOSH for the equivalent of up to a Reward Redemption amount of $500 USD in any day.\nWithout limiting any of the other conditions of these Terms, we may establish additional limits on your redemption of DOSH and otherwise modify the redemption terms for DOSH at any time in our sole discretion.<br>\n<br>(f) Taxes<br>\n<br>All amounts paid to you hereunder are exclusive of any applicable withholding, sales, use, excise, value added, or other taxes.\nYou acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for determining, paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services.\nWe are not responsible for determining whether you owe taxes

governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to any principle that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.<br>\u200d<br>\n<strong>21.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong>\n<br>For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration.\nIn the event of any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action, the complaining party must notify the other party in writing thereof.\nWithin 30 days of such notice, you and we agree to use reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve the dispute in good faith.\nIf you and we do not resolve the dispute within 30 days after such notice, the complaining party may seek remedies exclusively through arbitration.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided by applicable law, the demand for arbitration must be made within a reasonable time after the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action in question arose, and in any event within two years after the complaining party knew or should have known of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action.<br>\n<br>The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence.\nAs used in this Section, \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d mean the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, and assigns and all of our and their respective employees, officers, directors, agents, and representatives.\nIn addition, \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Services or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.<br>\n<br>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nThe arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes.\nAs modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the \u201cRules and Procedures\u201d).\nYou should review this Section carefully.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality of your residence or as otherwise provided in the Rules and Procedures within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court.\nAdditionally, notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate included in this Section, you and we may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and you and we hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose.\nA request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate.<br>\n<br>Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT A JUDGE OR JURY.\nYou are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.\nArbitrators\u2019 decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.<br>\n<br>You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n(B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS.\nMAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nAND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF.\n(c) we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as required by the Rules and Procedures and/or as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.\n(d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration.\n(e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.\n(f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.\n(g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law.\nand (h) each party will pay its own attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.<br>\n<br>This Section will survive termination of these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us.\nWith the exception of subparts (A) and (B) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this Section is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this Section will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein.\nIf, however, either subpart (A) or (B) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Section will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration.\nIf for any reason a controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial district of your residence.<br>\n<br>If you wish to opt out of the agreement to arbitrate included in this Section, you must notify us of your election in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to these Terms, or within 30 days of the effective date of any material change to these Terms, by sending a written notice to us by certified mail at the following address: 675 Ponce de Leon Avenue, Suite 6000, Atlanta, GA 30308.\nAttn: Arbitration Opt-Out.\nYour opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number, and

BINDING ARBITRATION.\nJURY TRIAL WAIVER.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER), the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms will not affect the validity of these Terms as a whole and any such provision should be enforced by authorities, and reconstructed if need be, to apply to the maximum extent allowable under applicable law.\nThe failure by us to enforce at any time any of the provisions of these Terms, to exercise any election or option provided herein, to require at any time your performance of any of the provisions herein, or to enforce our rights under these Terms or applicable law will not in any way be construed as a waiver of such provisions or rights.\nThe section headings used herein are for convenience only and will not be given any legal
