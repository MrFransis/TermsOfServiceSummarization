objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one-pixel GIF, that are placed on a web page, advertisement, or in an email message.\nThe GIF may tell us the IP address of the device that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and it can also identify a previously set cookie value, and how and where a user accessed a website.\nWe may use this information to count visitors across our Service and understand how they navigate and use our Service.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Location-Identifying

technologies collect audio through the microphone on your device to effectuate an instruction or request by you.\nWe only collect audio with your consent.\nWe only maintain the audio long enough to

analytics.</li>\n<li>\n<b>App-Specific Technologies</b>.\nOur apps include app-specific technologies, such as SDKs and APIs provided by third parties.\nAn SDK is code embedded in an app that sends information about your use to a server and is in effect the app version of a GIF.\nThe information collected through such technologies often includes your mobile Ad Id.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For further information on how we use Tracking Technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, please see the sections entitled&nbsp;<b>Social Media and

its Service to be appropriate for a wide range of audiences and not directed to children under 13 (\u201cChildren\u201d or \u201cChild\u201d).\nIn general, Children may access the Service only if Wizards has obtained prior verifiable parental consent from their parent or guardian in compliance with the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule (\u201cCOPPA\u201d).\nIf you are a parent or guardian, please discuss this Privacy Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Service and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Service.\nIf you have any questions or comments about how we treat Children\u2019s information or our compliance with COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Contact Us&nbsp;</b>below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If your child is a California resident, review the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Additional Disclosures for California Residents</b>.\nIf your child is in the

Children</b>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wizards may also offer certain areas of the Service that are identified as for Children and on such special areas of our Service we will either provide direct notice to a parent of our collection and use of Children\u2019s personal information as defined by COPPA and obtain prior verifiable parental consent or limit our data collection activities to comply with the obligations of COPPA for Child-directed services.\nFor a list of services that Wizards treats as being directed to Children under COPPA, please contact us as set forth in the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Contact Us</b>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Collection, Use, and Sharing of Children's Information</b>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wizards may collect, use, and share personal information from Children if it is submitted by a Child with prior verifiable parental consent or by the parent or guardian of the Child.\nTo determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether prior verifiable parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth.\nThose users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process.\nAs part of the parental consent process, parents have the choice of consenting to our collection and internal use of their Child\u2019s personal information but prohibiting us from disclosing that information to third parties (except to the extent such disclosure is integral to our Service).\nIf we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected information from a Child in violation of COPPA, we will promptly delete it.</p>\n<p>In limited circumstances, in accordance with COPPA, Wizards does not require verifiable parental consent prior to collection, use, or sharing of Children\u2019s personal information.\nFor example, Wizards may collect and store persistent identifiers (e.g., cookies, IP addresses, etc.) from Children without prior verifiable parental consent where we collect no other Children\u2019s personal information and such persistent identifiers are collected solely for the purpose of providing support for the internal operations of the Service.</p>\n<p>Subject to our compliance with COPPA, Wizards may collect personal information from Children for any of the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and may use, share, and otherwise process such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nWe take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of Children\u2019s personal information, including by taking reasonable steps to release such information only to parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality and security.\nWe retain Children\u2019s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.</p>\n<p>Please refer to the sections entitled&nbsp;<b>Information Collection</b>,&nbsp;<b>Information Use</b>, and&nbsp;<b>Sharing of Information&nbsp;</b>for further details on how we process

personal information.\nTo do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact us as set forth in the section entitled&nbsp;<b>Contact Us&nbsp;</b>below.</p>\n<p>Please be sure to include your Child\u2019s name and email address, your name and email address, and the area of the Service on which your Child is
