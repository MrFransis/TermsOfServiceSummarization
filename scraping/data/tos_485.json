to register for a Pluralsight account and receive access to the Platform.\nAccess to the Platform, including individual subscriptions, is to be used for the internal purposes of the business purchasing the Plan and may not be shared.\nIf your Plan requires it, or if you desire, we can assign and authorize users to specific features included in your Plan after your purchase so long as you

or, for online checkout, as of or around the Plan start date set forth during checkout.\nYou hereby agree that payment is due as of the date of any Pluralsight invoice, payable within thirty (30) days

handling personal information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>European Economic Area Data Subject Rights:</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, the following definitions apply to your

\u201c<b>Terms of Use</b>\u201d) or a Company Partnership Subscription (see below), then;</p>\n<p>\u2022 your employer is the data controller with respect to the user information it provides to us.\nThis information typically includes first name, last name, and business email address.\nWhere your employer is the data controller in this way, we act as a data processor under data protection laws, meaning we use the information to provide a service to your employer.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Pluralsight is the data controller for information provided directly by you or as a result of interacting with the Platform, including assessment data, a secondary email address, additional profile details such as job title, personal website URL, a short bio, social platform handles, and demographic

experience if you provide it.</p>\n<p>When you sign up as a user of the Platform via an Individual Plan (as defined in the Terms of Use), Pluralsight is the data controller for all personal information provided by that user and collected by the Platform as the user accesses and uses it.</p> 1.\nThe information we collect about you <p>We value your trust.\nIn order to honor that trust,

us</u>: Pluralsight uses the personal information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nWe use your personal information to provide our services on our Site, including

about you in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights).\nWe will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending on the types of information we receive).</p> 3.\nWho we give your information to <p>We consider your personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you and do not sell your personal information to third parties.\nThere are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personal information with certain third parties, as follows:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;<u>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</u>:&nbsp.\nWe sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions, such as sending email on our behalf, payment processing, or conducting market research.\nWe also share your email address with third parties, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter in order to provide custom marketing materials for you on their platforms.\nWhen we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.\nThese companies are not permitted to use any personal information that we share with them for any other purpose aside from providing services to us.</p>\n<p>We also share information with third parties about customer engagement on our platform.&nbsp.\nFor example, when you view a course about a technology vendor, we share information such as the number of course minutes viewed, Role and Skill IQ levels, hands-on course engagement, and other related data with that technology vendor.&nbsp.\nWe share this information and receive feedback from those third parties in order to improve the content available on our platform and better collaborate with our partners to jointly help companies and individuals address their skill development needs.&nbsp.\nUnless we specifically ask for and you grant consent, the data we provide to third parties does not include personal information.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;<u>Business Plans and Company Partnership Subscriptions</u>: We partner with certain third parties to provide our services to their employees or their community members.\nAs part of such partnerships, a third party may pay for the subscription for its employees or community members or otherwise contract with Pluralsight to make your subscription available to you, and Pluralsight may share information about your use of our services with the third party.\nIf your subscription was provided by your employer or community sponsor (including Company Partnerships as defined in the Terms of Use), we may share information you provide, or information we may otherwise collect through your registration and use of our services, with such third party.\nThis information may include course viewing history, course viewing time, course or assessment completion, course quality ratings and feedback, certifications, performance-related metrics, and other personal information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;<u>Business Transfers</u>: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.\nYour personal information may be transferred to a buyer or other successor in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event in which personal information held by us about our Site users is among the assets transferred.</p>\n<p>(d)&nbsp;<u>Legal Requirements</u>: In certain situations, Pluralsight may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\nWe reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or similar legal process served on us or our Site.</p>\n<p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only collect that personal information that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used.\nFurthermore, we will not process your personal information in a way that is incompatible with these purposes.</p> 4.\nControl of your information <p>When you register, or otherwise give us personal information, we will not share that information with third parties without your permission, other than for the limited exceptions already listed.\nIt will only be used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy.\nWhen Pluralsight is

marketing communications (i.e., e-mails concerning your order, the website\u2019s Terms of Use, etc.).\nYou will not have the ability to opt-out of receiving transactional emails via the Communications Preferences Dashboard.\nIf you have questions or concerns regarding a transactional e-mail, please contact us.</p> 5.\nYour access to your information and how long we keep it <p>Upon request, Pluralsight will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information.\nTo request this information please contact us at

active or as needed to provide you services.\nThereafter, we may retain certain personal information indefinitely as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\nWe may also retain aggregate information for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our Site and services.</p> 6.\nHow we protect your information <p>The security of your personal information is important to us.\nWhen you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our checkout page, your information is sent over an authenticated and encrypted

technologies and procedures intended to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\nNonetheless, no communication via the Internet can ever be 100% secure, and no security measures can ever be assured to be effective.\nAccordingly, you are advised to use caution and discretion when determining what personal information to disclose to us.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about security on our Site, contact us as follows:</p>\n<p>Email: support@pluralsight.com&nbsp;<br>\nPhone: (801) 784-9007 opt 1</p> 7.\nWhere we

Framework (\u201cPrivacy Shield).&nbsp.\nThough these frameworks have been ruled invalid for the transfer of data out of the EEA, Pluralsight will continue to protect data already transferred from the EEA pursuant to the Privacy Shield principles.</p> 8.\nUse of Cookies <p>Pluralsight and its affiliates use cookies or similar technologies to collect and store certain information.\nThese typically
