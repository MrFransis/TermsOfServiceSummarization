Use</li>\n<li> Services Agreement</li>\n<li> GDPR FAQs</li> CLAIM YOUR PROFILE </ul>\nPrivacy Notice for Data Subjects <p>This Privacy Notice (\u201cPrivacy Notice\u201d) is intended for anyone who wishes to review, modify, restrict or take ownership of the information that FullContact might have on them, as well as understand how FullContact uses that information.\nAdditional information for FullContact Users can be found in the&nbsp;Privacy Policy.</p> Overview <p>FullContact\u2019s core purpose is to&nbsp;<strong>make relationships better</strong>.\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced and multi-layered world, keeping up with everyone you know both online and offline can prove daunting.\nDiscovering, building, and cultivating authentic relationships with the people that matter most to you, both personally and professionally, is hard with our data scattered and fragmented all over the digital world.\nMost of us also expect the companies that we interact with to treat us like humans and know who we are as a person, not cogs in some machine.\nSometimes, having the right information at the right time makes all the difference.</p>\n<p>You can think of FullContact as the \u201cphone book\u201d for the modern digital world.\nWe do our best to bring together contact information from a variety of public sources (such as is available on the Internet through a simple Google Search) and combine it with contact information that our users contribute (similar to Wikipedia).\nWe couple that with powerful tools for individuals and companies to manage their contacts.</p>\n<p>We aim to have the most complete, accurate, and up-to-date record we can for each person in our \u201cphone book\u201d (also known as the \u201cFullContact Database\u201d).\nThe types of information we may keep track of include contact elements such as name, address, phone number, email, social profiles, and device IDs.\nWe often also have professional information (such as organizational affiliations, job titles, and skills) as well as personal information (such as interests, relationships, and basic demographic data like age, gender, and location).\nIn many cases we may also find associated profile photos.</p>\n<p>All of this information is intended to help the people and companies you interact with to know you better and be able to develop true and meaningful relationships with you.\nBased on the information someone already has on you, they might look you up in our system and get back some additional information.</p>\n<p>The information in our system also helps the people and companies you interact with to clean up their own \u201caddress books\u201d so that they don\u2019t have information about you scattered across multiple systems and devices and so that they don\u2019t connect with you multiple times, through different channels, with information that is entirely irrelevant to you.\nWe help our people and companies to gather their existing information into clean contact records for each individual they know.</p>\n<p>We also allow people or companies to search in our system for individuals who meet certain criteria.\nFor example, a professional who\u2019s trying to find an expert in their field can use our Services to find the right person.\nSimilarly, an organization could search for the most appropriate audience for their offerings.</p>\n<p>In all cases, our goal is to help people and companies make better, more valuable connections.\nWe recognize, however, that not everyone is comfortable sharing their contact information with others.\nFor this reason, anyone can take ownership of their information in our system at any time here:&nbsp;Own Your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>Actually, we hope that you do choose to take ownership of your information and help keep our \u201cphone book\u201d as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nIt is only through the contributions of people like you that we can provide this valuable service to you and everyone else.\nOur dream is to have everyone owning their data, fully controlling where it flows, and seeing better relationships in return.\nWe may ask in time for your consent to use that data but as of right now we shall keep our \u201cbooks open\u201d and you can restrict processing of some parts or all of your data.\nPeriod.\nPlease reach out at any time with any ideas on how we can serve you better.\nOwn Your Personal Data</p> Your Rights <p>Anyone, in any country across the world, may access, rectify, or restrict their Personal Data within FullContact Database at any time by visiting&nbsp;Own Your Personal Data.\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify your identity before taking action on your request.\nIf you ask us to erase your data, we may still have to retain certain data about you to ensure that your Personal Data does not re-enter our system and protect your rights.\nSpecifically, we will mark your Personal Data as \u201chidden\u201d and \u201crestrict processing\u201d such that your data is no longer used or made available to anyone.</p> California Privacy Rights <p>California\u2019s \u201cShine the Light\u201d law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses that share customer personal information with third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses\u2019 practices related to such information-sharing.\nAlternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose a customer\u2019s personal information to third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing.\nWe have such a policy in place.\nAs described in Section 8.2 of the Privacy Policy, you can opt-out of our sharing of your personal information with anyone (including with third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes) by clicking on the&nbsp;\u201cOwn Your Personal Data\u201d&nbsp;in that section of our Privacy Policy and choosing to \u201cDo Not Share\u201d.\nTo find out more about your opt-out rights, please contact us at the address listed in Section 11 of the Privacy Policy.\nPlease note that under California law businesses are only required to respond to a customer making such a request once during any calendar year.</p> General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) <p>Individuals in the EU may exercise any of the rights described in this section by using the applicable functionality in our Services or by contacting us directly.\nIf you reside outside of the European Union, you may have similar rights under your local laws.</p>\n<p>The purpose for processing, categories of Personal Data concerned, and categories of recipients of Personal Data are described in the \u201cOverview\u201d section above.\nOur lawful basis for processing is our legitimate interest in providing contact management services to our Users, enabling them to better connect and build their relationships with you.\nPersonal Data will be retained as long as necessary to serve that purpose or until you decide it is not in your best interest to keep your information in the FullContact Database.\nYou have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data at any time.</p>\n<p>If you have taken ownership of your data by following the necessary steps at (Own Your Personal Data) or by contacting us directly, we may ask for your explicit permission to share certain of your Personal Data.\nIf you choose to give permission to share certain information, then our lawful basis for processing is your Consent.\nYou have the right to withdraw your Consent at any time.\nYou also have the right of portability for any data that you have provided us.</p>\n<p>You have the right to request from us access to and rectification or erasure of Personal Data or restriction of processing.\nYou may exercise these rights at (Own Your Personal Data) or by contacting us directly.\nRequests for erasure can not be met because erasing your Personal Data would not achieve the desired result of your Personal Data not being in our system: we receive data continuously and would likely have your Personal Data in our system again quickly.\nInstead, we will mark your Personal Data as \u201chidden\u201d and \u201crestrict processing\u201d such that your data is no longer used in providing our service and is no longer made available to anyone.</p>\n<p>You have the right to request the sources of your Personal Data.\nYou may do so by contacting us as indicated in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section below.\nPlease note that to protect the rights of other data subjects, we may only be able to provide you with the general categories of sources.</p>\n<p>We may transfer, store, and process your information within our family of companies or with service providers based in the United States.\nFullContact complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively.</p>\n<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint with your applicable supervising authority.</p> How to Contact Us <p>If you have any questions

changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site, Services, or FullContact Data.\nYou are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address.\nIn the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will

acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Arbitration Agreement and Jury Trial Waiver, Class Action Waiver, And Forum Selection Clause</u>.\nAll controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and FullContact arising out of, under, or related in any way to this Terms of Use or our privacy practices, shall exclusively be settled through binding arbitration.\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitration shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nAs modified by this Terms of Use, and unless agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively \u201cRules and Procedures\u201d).</li>\n<li>You are thus GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract EXCEPT for matters that may be taken to small claims court.\nYour rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury.\nYou are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures are SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT.\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</li>\n<li>You and FullContact must abide by the following rules: (a) for any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing.\n(b) if the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions or a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, in which case one should be held at a location agreed to by you and FullContact, and if the parties cannot agree on a location for the hearing, the arbitrator will determine a location for the proceedings which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\n(c) the arbitrator\u2019s ruling is binding and not merely advisory.\n(d) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR FULLCONTACT MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n(e) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\n(f) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, FullContact will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation.\n(g) FullContact also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the arbitration.\n(h) the arbitrator shall honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law.\n(i) a decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact or conclusion of law) against either you or FullContact shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used against either of them in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person/FullContact customer.\nand (j) each side pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees\u2019 and litigation expenses.</li>\n<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or FullContact may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nIn addition, if you are a user outside of the United States, the Privacy Policy (Dispute Resolution for Users Outside of the United States), and not this arbitration provision, shall apply to any disputes related to privacy.\nFurther, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration provision.\nSuch claims shall be exclusively brought (unless such courts do not have personal jurisdiction in the dispute) in the state or federal courts located in Denver County, Colorado.\nAdditionally, notwithstanding this arbitration provision, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before such courts in order to maintain the status quo pending the arbitrator\u2019s ruling, and hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</li>\n<li>With the exception of subparts (d) and (e) in the paragraph above (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, either subpart (d) or (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor FullContact shall be entitled to arbitration.\nIn the event this arbitration provision is held unenforceable by a court, or in the event AAA refuses to arbitrate the dispute, all controversies, disputes, demands, counts, claims, or causes of action between you and FullContact shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in Denver County, Colorado.</li>\n<li>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at https://www.adr.org.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Choice of Law</u>.\nThe Terms of Use is made under and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Entire Agreement</u>.\nUnless you later enter into any other agreements with FullContact regarding the Site, Services, or FullContact, this Terms of Use is the complete and exclusive agreement between you and FullContact regarding your access to and use of the Site, Services, or FullContact Data.\nExcept as provided above, this Terms of Use supersede any prior agreement or proposal, oral or written, and any other communications between you and FullContact relating to your use of the Site, Services, or FullContact Data.\nOur failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe section titles in this Terms of Use are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nThe word including means including without limitation.\nIf any provision of this Terms of Use is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Terms of Use will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nFullContact will not be liable for any delay or non-performance of its obligations under this Terms of Use due to any cause beyond its control.\nYour relationship to FullContact is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.\nThis Terms of Use, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without FullContact\u2019s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.\nThe terms of this Terms of Use shall be binding upon assignees.\nThere are no third party beneficiaries of this Terms of Use.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Copyright/Trademark Information</u>.\nCopyright \u00a9 2010-2019, FullContact, Inc.\nAll rights

applies to the FullContact Data Services provided to Client through FullContact APIs pursuant to the Services Agreement (the <b>\u201cAgreement\u201d</b>) by and between Client and FullContact, to which this SLA is attached as an Exhibit and forms a part thereof.\nAll capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein will have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Uptime Commitment.</u> The FullContact Data Services will be available for 99.5% of the time during each calendar month (<b>\u201cUptime\u201d</b>).\nUptime will not include periods the FullContact Data Services are unavailable due to: (i) Routine Maintenance (defined below).\n(ii) Urgent Maintenance (defined below).\n(iii) the negligence, acts or omissions of Client or its End Users, any of the employees, contractors, or agents of Client or its End Users.\n(iv) the failure or malfunction of equipment, network, software, applications or systems not owned or directly controlled by FullContact.\n(v) any third party or public network or systems unavailability.\n(vi) circumstances or causes beyond the control of FullContact, including, without limitation, force majeure events and third party attacks on the FullContact network (such as ping and denial of service attacks).\n(vii) Client\u2019s use of an unsupported version of the API, or (viii) Client\u2019s (or any End User\u2019s) breach of the terms of the Agreement, including this SLA (collectively, <b>\u201cExclusions\u201d</b>).</li>\n<li>\n<u>Maintenance.</u> FullContact will occasionally perform modifications and upgrades to the FullContact Data Services (\u201cRoutine Maintenance\u201d).\nRoutine Maintenance ordinarily will not cause an interruption of the Services, but it may increase the risk of an interruption.\nFullContact will make reasonable efforts to limit interruption to no more than 15 minutes in any calendar week, and to limit Routine Maintenance to two hours in any calendar week.\nFullContact will also strive to schedule Routine Maintenance during times that have the least potential impact on Client.\nIf FullContact determines that immediate maintenance on the Services is required (\u201cUrgent Maintenance\u201d), FullContact can perform such Urgent Maintenance at any time and for any period of time (as determined by FullContact), and FullContact will provide Client with notice of Urgent Maintenance as soon as reasonably practicable under the circumstances.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Supported Versions.</u> Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, FullContact only provides support (including the commitments set forth in the Agreement and this Exhibit) for the current releases of the FullContact Data Services.\nIn the event FullContact releases a new version of a FullContact Data Service (including any updates, upgrades, enhancements, or fixes to the API), Client is required to use the new version of the FullContact Data Service as of the end-of-life date for the prior version.\nFullContact will notify Client of any end-of-life date at least six months in advance of such end-of-life date.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Remedy.</u> If FullContact does not meet the Uptime commitment set forth above for a given calendar month, FullContact will, as its sole obligation therefore and Client\u2019s sole remedy, provide a credit to Client that equals half of Client\u2019s invoice for the FullContact Data Services in the immediately previous calendar month.\nprovided that credits will not be offered if the FullContact Data Services are unavailable as a result of any of the Exclusions enumerated above.\nClient must notify FullContact.</li>\n</ol> Frequently Asked Questions 1.\nWhat is GDPR? <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).\nThe series of laws builds on an earlier policy, the Data Protection Directive, which Europe adopted in 1995.\nThe GDPR aims primarily to give control to residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.</p> 2.\nWhat steps does FullContact take to secure Personal Data? <p>FullContact places a premium on staying at the forefront of privacy and security practices.\nFullContact is SOC2 Type 1, PCI, Cloud Security Alliance, and U.S.-EU/Swiss Privacy Shield compliant, and employs a GDPR (CIPP/E) certified executive as part of its corporate leadership.</p> 3.\nWhat is considered \u2018personal data\u2019? <p>According to the GDPR, \u2018personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019).\nAn identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.</p> 4.\nWhat is \u2018client personal data\u2019? <p>\u2018Client personal data\u2019 is any \u2018personal data\u2019 that a Client sends or otherwise makes available to the FullContact Platform for processing.</p> 5.\nCan I control the data FullContact has about me? <p>Yes, you can.\nSimply click on the \u201cOwn Your Personal Data\u201d button in the left sidebar to access and modify your data.</p> 6.\nWhat does a Data Protection Officer do? Does FullContact have a Data Protection Officer? <p>The Data Protection Officer (DPO) informs and advises FullContact on its obligations pursuant to GDPR.\nmonitors compliance in relation to the protection of personal data (including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits).\nprovides advice on data protection impact assessments.\nand cooperates with the supervisory authority.</p>\n<p>FullContact was one of the first companies to have a GDPR (CIPP/E) certified executive and Data Privacy Officer.\nThe CIPP/E is the first professional credential specific to European data protection professionals that is part of a comprehensive, principles-based framework and knowledge base in information privacy.</p>\n<p>Data Protection Officer<br>\nTom Matzen<br>\ndpo@fullcontact.com<br>\n+1-888-330-6943</p> Data Solutions Customers:\n<p>These answers apply only to customers who are on the Private Plan and have signed a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) or will sign DPA as requested by Article 28 to satisfy GDPR compliance.</p> 7.\nUnder what conditions are FullContact products &amp.\nservices GDPR compliant? <p>FullContact data products and services are GDPR compliant.\nFor our data-products, the customer must execute a Data Processing Addendum (DPA).\nA Private Plan is also an option available for additional privacy protection, so no private data is ever stored in our data co-op and use of 3rd party sub-processors, with the exception of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is restricted.</p> 8.\nWhat client personal data is covered under the GDPR? <p>Only personal data of EEA data subjects is covered under GDPR.\nHowever, because it is often difficult to determine whether or not personal data belongs to an EU data subject, for Clients on the Private Plan, FullContact treats all client personal data as if it falls under GDPR.</p> 9.\nDoes a Client on the Private Plan contribute to the data co-op? <p>No, the Private Plan (which is currently required for GDPR compliance) does not allow for participation in the data co-op.</p> 10.\nCan a client be on the Private Plan and also opt-in to using Insights Bundles? <p>All Insights Bundles are available to customers on the Private Plan.\nThis includes Affinities, Social, Demographic, Location, Email Hash, Employment History, Key People, Individual, Professional, Finance, Household, Purchases, Lifestyle, and Shopping Habits.</p> 11.\nWhat does FullContact do with the personal data that a Client submits (e.g., a query to the FullContact API)? <p>Clients send client personal data (such as one or more personal identifiers) to FullContact when making an API request or providing a customer file for matching.\nAPI queries are logged in order to honor our contractual obligations related to fair billing.\nHowever, the log files of Private Plan clients record only the minimum query fields necessary for billing purposes and any client personal data is secured by encryption.</p> 12.\nHow does FullContact comply with the GDPR requirement for a processor to provide a list of sub-processors? <p>We do not use any sub-processors for Clients who have executed a DPA, except for FullContact\u2019s hosting provider, Amazon Web Services, with all relevant AWS data centers used by FullContact being located in the United States of America.</p> From where does FullContact source data? <p>Please see section 1, \u201cPersonal Data We Collect\u201d, of our Privacy Policy</p> Does FullContact share my information
