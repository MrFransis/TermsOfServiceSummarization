purpose.\nAnonymous data is data that does not identify you as an individual.\nAggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal information in law because it does not reveal your identity.</p>\n<p>For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in a product or service.</p>\n<p>However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we treat the combined data as personal information and it will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Special personal information</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Special personal information is data about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.</p>\n<p>We may collect special personal information about you if there is a lawful basis on which to do

you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform that contract.\nIn that case, we may have to stop providing a service to you.\nIf so, we will notify you of this at the time.</p>\nThe bases on which we process information about you\n<p>The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information,

the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your

service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.</p>\n<p>In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us.\nSome of this information may be personal information.</p>\n<p>We may use it in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>verify your identity for security purposes</li>\n<li>sell products to you</li>\n<li>provide you with our services</li>\n<li>provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We process this

time pass your name and contact information to selected associates whom we consider may provide services or products you would find useful.</p>\n<p>We continue to process your information on this

interests</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.</p>\n<p>Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whether the same objective could be achieved through other means</li>\n<li>whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm</li>\n<li>whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, we may process your data on this

expect a response</li>\n<li>protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party</li>\n<li>insuring against or obtaining professional advice that is required to manage business

obligation</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.</p>\n<p>For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.</p>\n<p>This may include your personal information.</p>\nSpecific uses of information you provide to us\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our website allows you to post information with a

the future in any way we decide.</p>\n<p>Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it.\nWe accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.</p>\n<p>Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted.\nYou can make a request by contacting us at shop@cardshack.co.uk</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Complaints regarding content on our website</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We attempt to

us.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Communicating with us</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you contact us, whether by telephone, through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in

us.</p>\n<p>We use that information to resolve your complaint.</p>\n<p>If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint.\nWe do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.</p>\n<p>We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Affiliate and business partner information</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.</p>\n<p>It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals.\nIt also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.</p>\n<p>The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>\n<p>We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.</p>\n<p>We

Regulation, or the GDPR, came into force from 25 May 2018.</p>\n<p>In the UK, the rights and obligations that the GDPR brought are written into a new law called the Data Protection Act 2018.\nThe Act remains in force even after the UK leaves the European Union.</p>\n<p>The requirements under the new law are similar in extent to prior data protection law in the UK.\nIf your business complies with prior law, then the changes you need to make are likely to be small.</p>\n<p>The possible implications for non-compliance are now much more severe.\nIn theory, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (the ICO) has the power to fine a business 4% of its annual worldwide turnover.</p>\n<p>However, as with other EU law regarding selling to consumers we believe that the ICO in practice is unlikely to fine many small businesses and organisations without having first given a warning.\nHaving a privacy notice (such as one based on this template) that shows some effort to comply with the law is likely, in our opinion, to generate enough goodwill with the ICO to avoid a fine in the first instance.</p>\n<p>Updating your website privacy notice is not the only requirement for compliance with the Act.\nYou are also likely to need to change how customers and visitors can access personal data held about them, and create new procedures for obtaining compliance to collect and use personal data.</p>\n<p>You may also need to update other legal documents, in particular, your website terms and conditions.\nFree versions of these are also available from our website.</p>\n<p>More information can be found at: https://www.netlawman.co.uk/ia/gdpr</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Using this template as the basis for your privacy notice</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your privacy policy should be concise (while also being comprehensive), transparent, easy to understand and easily accessible.</p>\n<p>We aim to balance those qualities in this document.\nHowever, we cannot know exactly how your business works, so you may need to edit the document significantly in certain places.</p>\n<p>We offer this template free as an example of a Net Lawman document.\nWe hope that you like it, and that you may buy other documents and services from us in the future.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the price, we assert our copyright in the document.\nOur standard licence terms apply.\nWhile you may not distribute the template without including our copyright, <strong>you may remove our copyright notice from the version you edit and use</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition to these paragraph specific guidance notes to help you edit the template, we also publish a free, more general guide to editing our legal documents, which you can download at: https://www.netlawman.co.uk/uploads/Editing Legal Document Templates.pdf</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please contact us at support@netlawman.co.uk</p>\n<p>Paragraph specific notes</p>\n<p>Numbered notes refer to specific numbered paragraphs in the template.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Identification of the owner of the website</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Act requires that you identify the business or the organisation that operates the website.\nUsing the domain name as the business name is not enough.\nYou need to provide a business or organisation name and an address.</p>\n<p>In practice, you may decide that you do not want to provide your name and address (for your own privacy reasons).\nYou may be more likely to get away with doing this if you don\u2019t trade from your website.</p>\n<p>If you have appointed a data protection officer, you should name that person here using words such as \u201cOur Data Protection Officer is [Name]\u201d.\nMost businesses or organisations that use this template will not be large enough to require one.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Introduction </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Leave these items in place unless there is a good reason to edit or remove.\nEach of these items has been carefully considered in the context of this document and has been included for a purpose.</p>\n<p>The first paragraph sets out the purpose of the document and explains terms used throughout it.</p>\n<p>The second and the third paragraphs aim to reassure readers that you take privacy seriously.</p>\n<p>The fourth paragraph demonstrates awareness of the Act and compliance.\nIt should also reassure visitors since \u201cGDPR\u201d is a term for which they will look.</p>\n<p>A key requirement of the law is that you tell your visitors and customers that they have rights with respect to how their personal information is processed.\nRather than cluttering your privacy notice with an explanation of their rights, we recommend referring your visitors to this explanatory website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nData protection officer</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Unless your organisation processes large volumes of personal information, you are unlikely to be required to appoint a data protection officer.</p>\n<p>If you have nominated an individual, you may mention him or her in this paragraph.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, you can delete this section.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nData we process</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Act only applies to personal data.</p>\n<p>Any of these paragraphs can be deleted or edited, although the ones in blue are most likely to be those that either do or don\u2019t apply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSpecial personal information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you process certain types of personal information, you are required to disclose that you do so.</p>\n<p>Use either the first two sentences or the last one.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf you do not provide the personal information we need</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This is a reminder to your customer or visitor that you may not be able to provide services if you are not given information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The bases on which we process information about you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A requirement of the Act is that you tell the data subject why you process the data and which legal basis you have chosen to use as the justification to process his or her data.</p>\n<p>Most websites will process different types of data on different bases.\nThe two most likely to apply are \u201cContract\u201d (after the visitor has accepted your terms and conditions) and \u201cConsent\u201d (after the visitor has agreed to your use of his or her data \u2013 usually by taking some affirmative action such as clicking on a button).\nSome data may also be processed because of a legal requirement or a legitimate interest.</p>\n<p>All the bases are described at: http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org/legitimate-uses/</p>\n<p>The reasons why you process the data arise as a result of the basis.\nIf there is a contract, there is a contractual obligation to carry out the service.\nIf the basis is consent, then there will probably be some benefit to the data subject of you using the information.</p>\n<p>You may want to edit these sections in minor ways (certainly where we have highlighted in blue).</p>\n<p>More importantly, you should make design changes to how your website works so as to obtain explicit consent, or have a visitor agree to your terms earlier in your relationship.</p>\n<p>For most websites, contract is the strongest basis for processing.\nIf you can design your website experience such that a visitor agrees to your terms early on, before providing personal information, you will have fewer grounds for complaints.\nFor example, you might reduce the requirement to provide detailed information when a visitor registers a basic account on your website, but place more content or functionality in an area of the website that requires the visitor to have such an account.\nAt the registration point, the visitor must tick a box to say that he or she has read and agrees to your terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>If you are relying on consent, then you might design a banner to appear when a visitor first arrives at your site (for example, encouraging him or her to read your cookies policy).\nThat banner might have two buttons \u2013 one that gives explicit agreement and one that doesn\u2019t.\nIf the visitor does not give explicit consent, then you redirect him or her to another \u201csafe\u201d website or state that certain functionality will be limited.</p>\n<p>Positive action needs to be taken by the visitor when agreeing to anything \u2013 pre-ticked boxes or close buttons don\u2019t count as affirmative action.</p>\n<p>Legitimate Interests is a basis that is fairly subjective.\nFor it to be used, you must have decided that there is a legitimate interest, that processing the data is necessary to protect that interest, and that the data subject\u2019s interests (or other interests) do not override it.\nIn some circumstances, it is most appropriate, but if possible, we would recommend using Contract or Consent as better alternatives.\nThe reason is simply that the data subject is less likely to complain if he or she has clearly asked you to process his or her data.</p>\n<p>Data subjects have a legal right to see the personal information you hold about them.\nYou need both an internal process as to how to provide this, and a means for the data subject to request the information.</p>\n<p>If the data subject is a registered visitor, then providing his or her data in an account area is a good way of providing this data.\nYou can also provide a way of giving consent to use of the data in the same place.</p>\n<p>If the data subject does not have an account, then you should give either an e-mail address or a physical address to which the data subject can send a request for his or her information.</p>\n<p>Lastly, for each basis you need to state when you stop processing the data.\nWe suggest that you don\u2019t edit our text.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Specific uses of information you provide to us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This section provides more information about specific types of information.\nThe paragraphs within it are as much designed to reassure a visitor reading your policy than to aid compliance with the law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nInformation provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This paragraph serves as a reminder that information that a visitor posts on your website may be available for public viewing, and that you cannot be held responsible if someone else copies it and uses it without the author\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p>It creates a licence for you to use it in any way you wish, which may be useful.</p>\n<p>You should provide a way for someone to contact you and request that content is removed.\nThis could be as simple as an e-mail address.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Complaints regarding content on our website</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This paragraph is a reminder to visitors that moderation of all user generated content is not always viable.</p>\n<p>It shows that you take complaints about content seriously, and also that a decision to remove content remains with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nInformation relating to your method of payment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are two options here.\nDelete whichever is not relevant.</p>\n<p>The first covers the situation where you do record card information.\nYou should edit the \u201cmeasures to protect your information\u201d so that they are relevant to your business.</p>\n<p>The second covers the situation where card information stays with the payment service provider.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t take payment at all, of course delete this paragraph completely.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nInformation about your direct debit</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not take payment by direct debit, delete this paragraph.\nOtherwise edit the wording in blue appropriately.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nJob application and employment</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The purpose of this paragraph is to set out for how long personal information is processed.\nIt is a requirement of the Act.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCommunicating with us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We suggest you keep this paragraph in your notice.\nHowever, you should edit it to suit how your organisation works.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nComplaining</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This paragraph deals with how information collected as a result of a complaint is used.\nIt should not be confused with an explanation of how to complain (which is dealt with later).\nWe suggest you leave this paragraph as is.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAffiliate and business partner information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Information relating to affiliates is not subject to the Act.\nThis paragraph should reassure business partners.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The start of this paragraph is an explanation of what cookies are.</p>\n<p>It is good practice to display a message when a visitor first comes to your website asking whether he or she accepts use of cookies.\nThe paragraph in blue supports this.</p>\n<p>We take the approach here of not listing every single cookie.</p>\n<p>The reason is that you not know this information yourself, especially if you use third party add-ons or plug-ins to your website.\nFor example, Google provides visitor tracking software (Analytics) that is popular.\nIt could at any point change the name or purpose of the many cookies it uses without telling you.</p>\n<p>There are so many cookies that software you use is likely to place that to list them here would increase the size and complexity of the notice, and to keep the notice up-to-date as they change would be time consuming.</p>\n<p>Listing every cookie\u2019s file name, purpose and expiration period could be done in a separate cookie notice, linked from this paragraph.</p>\n<p>We prefer the approach of explaining in what ways they are used.\nAdd or delete to this list as appropriate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nPersonal identifiers from your browsing activity</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most web servers log requests for pages.\nWe suggest you leave this paragraph as is, even if you don\u2019t use this information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nOur use of re-marketing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Re-marketing is the name given to the practice of advertising your products and services on third party websites based on pages on your website that the visitor has already seen.</p>\n<p>It requires you as the website owner to be the client of an advertising service provider.</p>\n<p>When a visitor visits a page of your website, the advertiser\u2019s software through your website places a cookie on the visitor\u2019s computer.\nWhen he or she visits another webpage on a third party website, you can choose whether or not to pay to show him or her an advert for your product or service.</p>\n<p>For example, you might sell fruit from your website.\nA visitor visits a page about the health benefits of eating a particular tropical fruit.\nLater, the same visitor visits another website about cookery, and specifically a page that describes a recipe that requires the tropical fruit.\nBoth your website and the cookery website use the same advertising service provider.\nYou can choose to pay to have your adverts for that tropical fruit to be displayed on the cookery website.</p>\n<p>The advertising service provider usually allows you to specify exactly what criteria must be met in order to display your advert, making re-marketing a cost efficient way of advertising.</p>\n<p>Some people feel very strongly about re-marketing.\nIt can elicit fears of \u201cbeing followed around the web\u201d, particularly if the topic of the advert is sensitive.</p>\n<p>You can choose to delete this paragraph entirely if you do not use re-marketing.\nHowever, keeping it in place will allow you to experiment with different types of display marketing later.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disclosure and sharing of your information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nInformation we obtain from third parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This paragraph is a reminder to visitors that you may use third party information provision services.\nDelete if not appropriate to your organisation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nThird party advertising on our website</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Delete if not appropriate to your organisation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCredit reference</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We suggest that you leave this paragraph in place even if you have no immediate intention of liaising with debt collectors.\nIt may be a useful \u201creminder\u201d to users of your website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nData may be processed outside the European Union</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It is a legal requirement to tell the visitor if his or her information is processed outside the EU.\nIt is especially important if you have your own business operations outside the EU.</p>\n<p>If you want to be as compliant as possible, you should also identify carefully whether you use services outside the EU.\nYou may use, for example, a US-based online software service to provide your chat system.</p>\n<p>In practice, it might be very difficult to identify exactly where software has been written, whether the software house processes your data in any way, and where this might take place.</p>\n<p>The clause giving examples (in blue) could be deleted entirely if you don\u2019t want possibly to mislead readers.</p>\n<p>The safeguards (bullet points at the end of the paragraph) seem verbose, but are copied verbatim from the legislation.\nChoose the most appropriate (one, maybe two) and delete the others.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Control over your own information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Under the Act, a data subject has a right to access information about him or her, and a right for that information to be kept up-to-date and only for as long as required.</p>\n<p>You should leave these three paragraphs in place, editing the addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other matters</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nUse of site by children</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Under UK law, you cannot form a contract with a child.\nSo a child cannot agree to your terms and conditions, which means that he or she cannot agree to your terms regarding use of his or her information.\nAdditionally, only a parent or guardian can give consent.</p>\n<p>So it is very difficult to have a lawful basis for processing personal information about children.</p>\n<p>Additionally, personal information about children is regarded as more sensitive than the same information about an adult.\nThe consequences for data breaches could be much greater.</p>\n<p>We suggest you edit this paragraph to suit your website and keep it in.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nEncryption of data sent between us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This paragraph is included to reassure visitors.\nIf you do not use SSL then remove the paragraph.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nHow you can complain</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This paragraph sets out standard wording that tells visitors how to make a complaint.</p>\n<p>It gives you a stronger argument to use arbitration or mediation as a means of resolving a complaint, rather than going to court.</p>\n<p>In any case, you must tell visitors to your site about their right to complain to the supervisory body, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nRetention period for personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It is a requirement of the Act to tell data subjects for how long personal information will be kept.\nThis paragraph is a catch-all if the information is not provided elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Basic UK law relating to limitation for bringing a claim, contract matters, tax and other areas often requires data to be retained for six years.\nYou will be \u201csafe\u201d if you specify that period for commercial transactions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>32&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nCompliance with the law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Leave this paragraph in place.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>33&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nReview of this privacy policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Leave this paragraph in place.</p>\n<p>End of notes</p> ", "created_at":

</strong>\n<strong>Consumer Contracts (ICAC) Regulations 2013</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For an online retailer of goods the new Regulations are evolutionary rather than a revolution.\nWe have written a number ofarticles explaining each point.</p>\n<p>To keep it simple, If you sell physical goods then the Regulations apply to you as on any seller of goods and you must comply with the Regulations in respect of goods.</p>\n<p>The main provisions which affect your business are first, provision of information relating to goods and your identity.\nand second, the cancellation provisions.</p>\n<p>The required information is explained fully in our article \u201cInformation requirements for Distance Contract<u>\u201d</u>.\nHere is a short version:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>description of the main characteristics of the goods;</li>\n<li>the total price of the goods inclusive of VAT;</li>\n<li>Your identity, land address and full contact details;</li>\n<li>the arrangements for payment and delivery of goods;</li>\n<li>the telephone cost of communicating with you when it is not calculated at the basic rate;</li>\n<li>the existence of your customer\u2019s right to cancel the contract.\nand the conditions, time limit and procedure for exercising that right;</li>\n<li>whether, if the customer exercises the right to cancel, he must bear the cost of returning the goods;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Next, we will tell you about the cancellation provisions.</p>\n<p>If the customer at any time chooses to purchase goods from your website, he may cancel his order within 14 days without giving any reason.\nWhen he cancels the order, you must give him his money back within 14 days after receiving the cancellation order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please note:</strong> When you sell goods to consumer, you have no choice but to inform your customer about his cancellation right and provide cancellation form.\nThat means your customer may cancel the order and return the goods.\nThis document is drawn allowing you to fully comply with the Regulations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>What you need to do to comply with the Data Protection Act 2018</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Act applies to all personal data you collect, use or store.\nThe scope includes data about any INDIVIDUAL.</p>\n<p>We have drawn a comprehensive privacy notice.\nIt reassures your website visitors that you take their privacy seriously.\nMore importantly, your adopting it will prompt you to make whatever changes are necessary in your day to day business.\nYou can download it at https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/website-privacy-policy</p>\n<p>For this terms and conditions document, you do not have to explain to customers that you comply with law - any more than you would tell them you comply with any other law.\nThis document is your legal contract with your customer or client.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, if a customer or client takes the trouble to read this T&amp;C document, the reason is probably because they seek re-assurance.\nFor that reason, and not for any legal reason, we have included a few points of information.\nThere is no reason why you should not do so too.\nIf you do, we strongly advise to keep them very short and that you check most carefully that you are not adding text that could result in your contravening the Act.</p>\n<p>As a vastly reduced summary, the important areas of the Act to consider are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you do not have a provision where you are assuming implied consent of customer to use his information in the way you think fit;</li>\n<li>if you allow a user to post information to your website, you may not process, edit or change that information without express consent, if such information include his name, address, image etc.</li>\n<li>Until now, you could simply ask for a tick to a box indicating that your customer or client has read your T&amp;C.\nThat is no longer good enough.\nYou need to say exactly what you might do with your user's data.</li>\n<li>The most important elements of data to consider are personal data and any data which you want to use - for example as a testimonial.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You

have drawn this terms and conditions document on the assumption that you would make practical changes on your website and use an updated privacy notice.\nSo as to allow you to run your business seamlessly while complying with Act.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Recognition of our copyright in this document</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We assert our copyright in this document.\nWhen you downloaded

paragraph numbers.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Definitions</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every business is different, not only in terms of the product or service being offered, but also the processes.\nThe defined terms that we use are unlikely to suit most businesses perfectly.</p>\n<p>By all means use the search and replace function in your word processor to change them, either to other general adjectives, or to specific product or service names.\nFor example:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We use You might decide to change to</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\u201cGoods\u201d \u201cProducts or Toys\u201d/ \u201cHeadphones\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cOur Website\u201d \u201cThe ToyStore Site\u201d/ \u201cThe Site\u201d</p>\n<p>But if you do change the defined word, <strong>make sure it applies to every use of it in the document</strong>.\nRemember too, that when a word or phrase is defined, the defined meaning, capitalised, takes precedence over the common meaning of that word or phrase.</p>\n<p>You should first decide on the contents of the document, then return to check what definitions are needed and whether they really fit the text you have left in place.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Interpretation</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Leave these items in place unless there is a good reason to edit or remove.\nMany of them strengthen the framework within which the agreement operates.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Our contract with you</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph prevents a party from later saying he was relying on some other document or web site or conversation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Acceptance of your order</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph establishes the contract.\nThis is very important in an Internet contract because there are so many places in the buying procedure where it could be claimed that the contract has been completed.By leaving the point at which the contract is formed as late as possible, you avoid a position arising where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you hold your customers\u2019 goods.\nor</li>\n<li>every piece of advertising or information on your website could constitute an offer.\nor</li>\n<li>a customer could claim goods that you inadvertently priced wrongly.\nor</li>\n<li>goods are provided later than you expected or represented.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are three options.\nMake quite sure that one of these accurately reflects the way your order process works.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Price and payment</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You must edit these paragraphs to make sure that they reflect how your business works.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Security of your credit card</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph is more for information than contractual commitment.\nWe have included it here because many users are reluctant to make payment, so this assurance given at the point of sale will allay their fears.</p>\n<p>For payment you may have various alternatives like the PayPal, Bacs and cheque.\nEdit this paragraph accordingly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Cancellation and refunds</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you sell only to businesses and organisations, delete this and the following paragraph.</p>\n<p>This paragraph sets out your customer\u2019s rights as a \u201cgold standard\u201d.\nIn the past, the law has not compelled a seller to disclose his legal obligations.\nSo sellers have not done so.\nThese regulations change that.\nBecause many organisations continue to keep customers in the dark, we believe it is to your advantage to be utterly transparent.\nNot only will that present you as a high prestige brand, but it will also make clear that you are being unusually helpful and not unnecessarily bureaucratic.\nThere are three pillars of consumer protection:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provision of information</li>\n<li>the 14 day cancellation period</li>\n<li>\u201cno fault\u201d return within 14 days of purchase</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Liability for subsequent defects</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A buyer\u2019s right to return faulty goods dates back to 1890.\nIt applies today to all goods, as it did then.\nRecent consumer law has re-enforced the right, but not reduced or increased it.</p>\n<p>If goods are not of satisfactory quality, as described and fit for particular purpose they may be returned for a full refund.</p>\n<p>The minimum period within which you can insist on returned is six months.\nHowever, in common law, the return period depends on the estimated life of the product.\nIf you expect it to last for twenty years, you could reasonably expect replacement for a fault appearing after six years.\nBut your right will dissipate faster in the case of a product which deteriorates fast (shoe laces) or which could have been subject to rough usage (vacuum cleaner, saucepan, carpet)</p>\n<p>This paragraph sets out \"standard\" limits to enable you to comply with the Consumer Rights Act 2015.\nIt also covers your other statutory and common law obligations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If goods are defective on arrival or within 30 days, the buyer is entitled to a full refund of the cost, the cost of returning them, and, if the buyer is a business, any economic loss arising from your failure to comply with your implied obligations.</p>\n<p>If a defect becomes apparent only later, it will not be clear whether the buyer must accept a repair, an alternative, a precise replacement, or his money back.\nThen it entirely depends upon the nature of goods, defect and your business policy as what is most convenient option for you to repair or replace or refund the cost.</p>\n<p>Because most buyers of this document supply consumers, we have provided terms which comply with the Consumer Rights Act 2015.</p>\n<p>To comply with the Consumer Rights Act 2015, do not reduce the \u201cguarantee\u201d period below six months.\nThis is requirement of the law.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Delivery and pick up</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As for the paragraph on price and payment, there are many alternative ways that your business could work.\nEdit these paragraphs to suit your business.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Foreign taxes and duties</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is important to make this point clear if any of your sales are to other countries.It is not simply a question of avoiding expense or dealing with these matters yourself.More important is that if you tangle with the tax authorities of a foreign government, you may find yourself on the wrong side of the law if you later travel to that country.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Goods returned</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph includes terms to return defective goods where your customer is a business or an organisation.</p>\n<p>We have provided a sensible set of terms.\nHowever, the law everywhere provides that if you sell defective goods or services you are obliged to pay for all foreseeable resulting loss and expense.\nThat is the common law, pre-dating any sale of goods act.</p>\n<p>We have added for your convenience provisions for returning which may not be enforceable but which will certainly facilitate the procedure.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment Regulations 2013</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The WEEE Regulations are a requirement for retailers who sell electrical goods.\nIf your business does, leave these paragraphs in place, otherwise remove.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Disclaimers</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We do not have sufficient information about your business to determine how far you can use this paragraph and how binding it will be.\nWe therefore provide an explanation, some parts of which will not apply to you.</p>\n<p>Our aim in drawing this paragraph is to limit your liability as far as possible, particularly against events you may not anticipate.\nWe are also aware that you might sell to business, not consumers, and to consumers outside the EU.\nNote however, that most advanced economies protect their consumers in much the same way as EU consumers are protected.\nHowever, a foreign government would have great difficulty in enforcing its rules against you!</p>\n<p>There is a substantial set of law which regulates what you can sell to anyone, so no matter what you put in this paragraph, it will not protect you in contract if you sell something different from what an intelligent customer or client would expect.\nComparable law covers every part of the sale and return process.</p>\n<p>On top of that solid legal structure is an even larger structure relating to protection of consumer rights.\nThat is because consumer protection is extreme in the EU.\nIf you sell to consumers, even occasionally, you must learn what are your legal obligations.\nThe depth of law is huge - far more than we could ever advise here.</p>\n<p>We have therefore provided not merely alternative provisions within this paragraph, but two alternative paragraphs.\nOne version is what you can reasonably say if you deal with consumers.\nthe other is the \"hard\" version which covers everyone else.\nSelect the version according to whether or not you sell to European consumers.</p>\n<p>If you sell Worldwide, you could of course arrange for only users outside the EU to receive the hard version - whoever they are.</p>\n<p>It is possible that neither of these alternatives will be entirely enforceable.\nHowever we have also specified that any provision which offends should be reduced, as opposed to be deleted.\nIn these paragraphs we have provided a terrific contractual shield - but somewhere there may be someone whose arrows will pierce it.</p>\n<p>Our best advice to you is to include these disclaimers so far as they apply to your business, but do not expect that you can conduct your business with disregard to the law.\nThe Sale of GoodsAct and Misrepresentation Act and a raft of consumer protection law still apply.</p>\n<p>You will see that we have also included in the provision for directors and others to have the same protection.\nOne way to get around disclaimer provisions in the past was to claim not against the company with whom the claimant has a contract but against the directors or others in negligence.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Your account with us</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These terms provide some protection in case of customer disputes about use of an account.\nWe recommend leaving these if your website records customer information for subsequent purchases.\nIf they are not applicable, remove them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Restrictions on what you may Post to Our Website</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This and the following four paragraphs relate directly to aspects of the interface between you and your buyers.\nThe more they are allowed to enter data, upload, download, leave messages, and so on, the greater your risk.\nYou cannot stop a criminal by a term in a document, but you can make clear to regular users, before and after the event, that you will take a tough line for bad behaviour.</p>\n<p>The paragraphs in this section have two purposes: the first is the obvious and named purpose of preventing damage to your website and establishing a contractual obligation by your site users not to do so.\nSecondly, it may assist in protecting you from civil or criminal charges for which you may otherwise be liable as a result of what someone else posts to your website.</p>\n<p>No matter what you put in these paragraphs, there is no certainty that you may not be the subject of some sort of attack or other problems.\nHowever, we do think it is worth providing a full and strict policy.\nBy doing so, you have the best possible defence against anyone who claims he has been insulted, injured, defamed, or whatever.</p>\n<p>Of course, anyone who wishes to continue to use your business will comply.</p>\n<p>We suggest that you edit these paragraphs in line with the perceived extent of your risk.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Your Posting: restricted content</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph continues in the vein of the previous one.\nAs you see, we intend to make clear that certain other activities are prohibited.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>How we handle your Content</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is a question of balance and maybe how your buyers will react.\nYou are free to delete all or any of it.</p>\n<p>This particular paragraph covers a sensitive issue.\nYou should edit to suit the way you operate your business.\nYou need to provide a balance between making precise promises which could trip you up on the one hand and giving a tight enough framework to convince doubters that you will not sell their data.\nYou should also make sure you have the current Net Lawman privacy policy in support.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Removal of offensive Content </strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph is targeted at anyone who is aggrieved by your site content.\nHe may or may not be one of your customers.\nBy stating and following this policy you will reduce the chance of any claim for defamation, breach of copyright, and so on.\nDepending on how you attract acceptance of the terms generally, this paragraph may not be enforceable against a visitor who has not explicitly agreed to these T&amp;C (for example, visitors who are not subscribers).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Security of Our Website</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is an intentional overlap here with the paragraph on restrictions on posting.\nYour need for this provision also depends on the extent to which users are able to post content of any sort.\nDelete provisions which are stronger than you need.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Indemnity</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We suggest no edits.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Intellectual Property</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Few business managers appreciate just how much IP is owned by the business.\nThere is an enormous variety of IP rights, from domain names to trade marks.</p>\n<p>We suggest that you edit these paragraphs, but keep them within the document.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Dispute resolution</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This paragraph sets out standard terms as required under the Alternative Dispute Regulations 2015.This new law follows an EU directive.\n<strong>Our opinions</strong> are as follows:</p>\n<p>The new law is directed at those EU members whose legal systems have perhaps not been fine tuned for nearly 1000 years and which fail to recognise consumer rights adequately.</p>\n<p>UK courts have more or less insisted on litigants going to mediation in cases where the judge concerned is of the opinion that \u201cheads should be knocked together\u201d.\n(Net Lawman documents have included a mediation paragraph for 15 years!)</p>\n<p>The purpose of mediation (the most common form of ADR) is to settle a dispute.\nIn practice it should not matter who is the mediator.\nOf course you should try to find someone with the appropriate experience of business and commercial life, but the requirement for a \u201cqualified\u201d person is meaningless.\nMediation is not a subject you can learn from a book.\nSo, if you need to find a mediator, you will have no trouble in finding someone acceptable to both sides.</p>\n<p>Mediation costs money.\n\u00a31000 to \u00a33000 would be the approximate rate outside London, for reading the papers and giving a full day.\nSo if the sum in dispute is less than \u00a310,000, even mediation may be unacceptable.</p>\n<p>There seems to be some confusion in the EU regulations as to how far arbitration is included in the proposals.\nIn many EU countries arbitration is either unregulated or confined to international issues like shipping and insurance.\nHere in the UK, it is regulated very precisely by the Arbitration Act 1996.</p>\n<p>As a result of that act, arbitration entails very similar procedures to those in formal litigation.\nMost arbitration is as expensive and time consuming as litigation.\nIt is certainly not \u201calternative\u201d dispute resolution in a way that saves time or money.\nThat is why the courts do not promote it.\nWe advise that you avoid it!</p>\n<p>The new regulations require that if you know of a mediator, you should provide details.\nHowever, it seems to us that the last person your opponent would agree to use is someone with whom you already have a relationship.\nIndeed, it would be immoral if that person even agreed to accept repeated instructions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From here numbering now once again relates to the paragraph in the document.</p>\n<p>The law requires that when your internal complaint handling procedure is exhausted then you musttell your customers about using a mediation or arbitration platform.\nYour obligation is not to force the customer to use these means of dispute resolution but just to provide information.\nThis is to encourage the customer to use ADR rather than litigating.</p>\n<p>22.4: in the unlikely event that your business is a large organisation where you have voluntarily committed yourselves (to your trade association?) to use ADR.\nthen by all means provide the name, website and contact details of your selected ADR provider.</p>\n<p>However, as an online seller of goods the law requires you to provide a link to online alternative dispute resolution platform which is at http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</p>\n<p>You may find more details at:</p>\n<p>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/542/contents/made</p>\n<p>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/1392/pdfs/uksi_20151392_en.pdf</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Do not delete this paragraph.\nThis is the requirement of law.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Miscellaneous matters</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A number of special points.Unless you have a good reason to delete any one of these, we recommend that they should remain as drawn.</p>\n<p>Email communications are usually binding in the UK, but may not be, elsewhere.In any case, not everyone is aware of the legal position.If your business is such that you do <strong>not</strong> want email to be binding, you may specify that to be the case and so it will be.</p>\n<p>Take care before agreeing to accept service by e-mail.It may be convenient, but you could miss or accidentally delete the message.</p>\n<p>Rights of Third Parties Act - We have provided reference of two Acts.\nBy all means select the one according to your jurisdiction clause.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice of right of cancellation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At the end of the terms document, we have provided the information you must provide to a customer in order to comply with the Regulations.\nThis is not optional.\nDo not delete or edit.</p>\n<p>The first part is your notice to your customers.\nThe second part provides the required information about the cancellation notice followed by the model form.\nUse a page break before showing these, so that they can be printed easily (if your customer wants to send it by post).</p>\n<p>End of notes</p> ",
