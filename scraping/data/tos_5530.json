Secretariat Policy on Privacy Protection defines administrative purpose as the use of personal information about an individual \"in a decision making process that directly affects that

programs.</p>\n<p> Return to footnote1 Referrer </p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Footnote 2</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>The Policy on Privacy Protection defines non-administrative purpose as the use of personal information for a

purposes.</p>\n<p> Return to footnote2 Referrer </p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Footnote 3</dt>\n<dd>\n<p> The nature of the Internet is such that web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address.\n<abbr>IP</abbr> addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet.\nWeb servers automatically log the <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses of visitors to their sites.\nThe <abbr>IP</abbr> address, on its own, does not identify an individual.\nHowever, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an <abbr>ISP</abbr> for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site.\nFor this reason, the Government of Canada considers the <abbr>IP</abbr> address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when a visitor requests a Web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.\n</p>\n<p> Return to footnote3 Referrer </p>\n</dd>\n</dl> Report a problem or mistake on this page Please select all that apply: A link, button or video is not working It has a
