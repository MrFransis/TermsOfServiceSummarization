\u201cwearer\u201d) and switched to the record mode, each eye of the wearer is filmed by one eye camera integrated into the spectacle frame.\nThe two videos recorded by the two eye cameras are fed into a machine learning algorithm (neural network) which calculates the 2D gaze coordinates, and if the world camera is connected, an egocentric third video is recorded which can serve to visualize the gaze point of the wearer.\nTherefore, two (or three) videos are recorded and stored per recording \u2013 one from the world camera (if connected) and one from each of the two eye cameras.\nThe data is saved into a recording folder on the cell phone (companion) device.</p>\n<p>During each recording, metadata are also collected and these include recording timestamps, world camera and spectacles serial numbers, world camera image coordinates (2D gaze coordinates), cell phone (android) device ID/model/name, IMU (gyroscope) raw data, wearer ID (uuid), and audio data from the world camera microphone if switched on.</p>\n<p>The processing of this data is based on Art.\n6 (1) b.\nGDPR.</p> Training Videos <p>In order to improve individual gaze estimation accuracy, users will be able to perform a special routine for a wearer, which consists of recording a short video while looking at a reference gaze target on the cell phone screen.\nWe then use the eye-tracking data and metadata to fine-tune the \u201cuniversal\u201d neural network into a personalized neural network, which can then be uploaded to the corresponding spectacle device.\nFor this process, we collect the spectacle serial number, cell phone ID and wearer ID (uuid).</p>\n<p>The processing of this data is based on Art.\n6 (1) b.\nand f.\nGDPR as the training data is used to improve the accuracy of the Services in order to best fulfil the contractual obligations and to improve the quality of the Services in general.</p>\n<p>If you choose to delete a wearer profile, we will ask you to further use the associated training data to improve the quality of the Services.\nYou can request deletion of this data via email.\nOtherwise, you consent to the processing of this data based on Art.\n6 (1)

Inc.\n(https://aws.amazon.com/) , Digital Ocean, LLC (https://www.digitalocean.com) and Hetzner Online GmbH (https://www.hetzner.de), on servers located in Germany.\nSuch upload is optional and

order to use our cloud service, you have to register with us, or log in using your previously-provided registration details.\nDuring the registration process, we ask you to provide us with certain data.\nSuch data will only be sent and provided to us after you clicked the respective \u201cSign Up\u201d button.</p>\n<p>We will use your submitted data to carry out your registration with us,

the Services, based on Art.\n6 (1) b.</p> Video Recordings <p>Whenever the Pupil Invisible device is mounted on the head of an individual (the \u201cwearer\u201d) and switched to the record mode, each eye of the wearer is filmed by one eye camera integrated into the spectacle frame.\nThe two videos recorded by the two eye cameras are fed into a machine learning algorithm (neural network) which calculates the 2D gaze coordinates, and if the world camera is connected, an egocentric third video is recorded which can serve to visualize the gaze point of the wearer.\nTherefore, two (or three) videos are recorded and stored per recording \u2013 one from the world camera (if connected) and one from each of the two eye cameras.\nThe data is saved into a recording folder on the cell phone (companion) device.</p>\n<p>During each recording, metadata are also collected and these include recording timestamps, world camera and spectacles serial numbers, world camera image coordinates (2D gaze coordinates), cell phone (android) device ID/model/name, IMU (gyroscope) raw data, wearer ID (uuid), and audio data from the world camera microphone if switched on.</p>\n<p>The processing of this data is based on Art.\n6 (1) b.\nGDPR.</p> Training Videos <p>In order to improve individual gaze estimation accuracy, users will be able to perform a special routine for a wearer, which consists of recording a short video while looking at a reference gaze target on the cell phone screen.\nWe then use the eye-tracking data and metadata to fine-tune the \u201cuniversal\u201d neural network into a personalized neural network, which can then be uploaded to the corresponding spectacle device.\nFor this process, we collect the spectacle serial number, cell phone ID and wearer ID (uuid).</p>\n<p>The processing of this data is based on Art.\n6 (1) b.\nand f.\nGDPR as the training data is used to improve the accuracy of our service in order to best fulfil the contractual obligations and to improve the quality of our service in general.</p>\n<p>If you choose to delete a wearer profile, we will ask you to further use the associated training data to improve the quality of our service.\nYou can request deletion of this data via email.\nOtherwise, you consent to the processing of this data based on Art.\n6 (1) a.\nGDPR.</p> How are your data stored? <p>Each Pupil Invisible device is connected to a companion cell phone which serves as a data processing and storage unit and serves as power supply.\nThe videos recorded from each exercise can be securely uploaded from the companion cell phone to Pupil Labs cloud storage, currently hosted by cloud service providers, Digital Ocean, LLC (https://www.digitalocean.com) and Hetzner Online GmbH (https://www.hetzner.de), on servers located in Germany.\nSuch upload is optional and provided via an explicit opt-in procedure.\nHowever, we have valid data processing agreements with the aforementioned host providers in order to ensure a high level of security for your personal data.</p>\n<p>Once uploaded, you can review recordings on the web and collaborate with your team and colleagues.\nYour team can collaborate at any stage of the research workflow - from study prep, synchronization of devices in the field, to post-hoc analysis.\nRecordings are organised and searchable by meta-data so you can easily find and filter recordings to download for further analysis.</p>\n<p>We, on the other hand, have no access to the recordings or any of your data which are uploaded to the cloud, except in the case of the training videos where we seek to improve individual gaze estimation accuracy.</p> Duration of the storage of personal data.\ndeletion periods <p>As a rule, we only store your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the execution of the contract or the respective purpose and limit the storage period to an absolutely necessary minimum.\nTherefore, we

so.</p> Automated Decision Making (\u201cProfiling\u201d) <p>We do not process any data via \u201cprofiling\u201d or in form of automated decision making via our App or service.\nProfiling means any automated processing of personal data consisting in the use of such personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects relating to the performance of work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or relocation of that natural person.\nExamples of such profiling include the analysis of data (e.g.\nbased on statistical methods) with the aim of displaying personalized advertising to the user or giving shopping tips.</p> Are your data transferred to third parties? <p>We will transfer your personal data to a third party only within the scope of legal provisions, i.e.\nin the course of a data processing agreement or if we are obliged to transfer the data

of Service\u201c).\nPupil Labs may amend the Terms of Service pursuant to section 14 hereof.</p>\n<p>1.3.\nThe Pupil Cloud Service offerings of Pupil Labs are available to both Consumers and Business

who enters into the relevant contract in the conduct of their business or self-employed professional activity (Sec.\n14 (1) of the German Civil Code).</p>\n<p>1.4.\nStandard business conditions and/or

GmbH (https://www.hetzner.de) and Amazon Web Services Inc.\n(https://aws.amazon.com), but reserves the right to replace its services by similar services of third parties that are operating servers in

automatically renewed for another month/year (as applicable) until the User or Pupil Labs terminate the subscription.</p> 4.\nScope of Service/Availability <p>4.1.\nThe scope of the Pupil Cloud Services depends on the respective subscription plan chosen by the User as further described on the Website.</p>\n<p>4.2.\nThe Pupil Cloud Services will be offered subject to availability.\nPupil Labs aims at an average service availability of 99% per calendar month.\nThe decisive factor is the availability of the Pupil Cloud Services at the Transfer Point.\nNot included in the calculation of

Pupil Cloud Services, the User must frequently check all technical details and conditions on the Website, which will be updated by Pupil Labs (\u201cTechnical Requirements\u201d).</p>\n<p>5.2.\nThe User is solely responsible for the fulfilment of the Technical Requirements.\nPupil Labs does not owe and/or provide any consultancy services in connection therewith if not otherwise agreed with Pupil Labs.</p> 6.\nPrices and Payment <p>6.1.\nThe User, when using a paid subscription plan, will be required to provide Pupil Labs with billing and account information for credit card, debit or other payment systems (each a \u201cPayment Source\u201d) for which the User is authorized to approve charges to allow Pupil Labs to collect payment from the User for their purchase(s).\nThe User authorizes Pupil Labs to automatically and immediately bill the Payment Source when payments for subscription plans are due.</p>\n<p>6.2.\nThe billing of a subscription plan is made on a pre-paid basis.\nThe payment source will be billed within five bank working days of the beginning of the chosen subscription period and at every renewed period of subscription respectively according to the current price

terminated before the end of the ordered subscription period or the end of the respective renewed period.\nThe User can also change the length of the ordered subscription plan before the end of their subscription period instead of terminating the Agreement.\nThe ordinary termination of an Agreement before expiry of the respective subscription period is hereby excluded.</p>\n<p>7.3.\nThe right of termination for cause and without notice remains unaffected for both parties.\nA good cause for termination shall include, but shall not be limited to, any of the following events:</p>\n<p>7.3.1.\nthe
