DISPUTES <p>\n<b>Governing Law.</b>\n<br>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Laws of New York without application of conflict of laws rules, except that the Arbitration provisions shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Resolution of Any Dispute.</b>\n<br>In the event a dispute arises between you and Inquire Network, we want to provide you with an efficient, neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute.\nMost customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by contacting our customer service team online by going to https://www.GiftCardQuiz.com/contactus.asp or writing us at Inquire Network, Inc.\nPO Box 4668 #23563, New York, NY 10163-4668.\nIf, however, there is an issue that needs to be resolved, the following provisions of this Section 11 describe how both of us will proceed: </p>\n<p>\n<b>Limitation of Legal Remedies.</b>\n<br>If there is a dispute that remains unresolved, INSTEAD OF SUING IN COURT, YOU AND INQUIRE NETWORK EACH AGREE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THE JAMS ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES, ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, WITHOUT CLASS RELIEF, EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES PERTAINING TO INQUIRE NETWORK\u2019 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\nSTATUTORY CLAIMS THAT PURSUANT TO LAW ARE NOT ARBITRABLE.\nINDEMNIFICATION.\nCONTRIBUTION.\nINTERPLEADER.\nOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ARISING OUT OF A CLAIM.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes claims based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (\u201cClaim(s)\u201d).\nThe arbitrator's decision and award is final and binding, with some exceptions under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n1, et seq., and judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Jury Trial Waiver.</b>\n<br>YOU AND INQUIRE NETWORK EACH VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Class Action Waiver.</b>\n<br>YOU AND INQUIRE NETWORK EACH AGREE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nAll arbitrations under these Terms must be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide) basis, and an arbitrator will have no authority to award class-wide relief.\nYou acknowledge and agree that these Terms specifically prohibit you from commencing any legal proceedings as a representative of others, participating in a class, representative, or collective action as a class representative, class member or an opt-in party, acting as a private attorney general, or joining or consolidating Claims with claims or proceedings brought by any other person (\"Class Action Waiver\").\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Procedures.</b>\n<br>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the Claim and setting forth the specific relief sought (a \"Notice\").\nAll Notices to Inquire Network must be sent to the following address: Inquire Network, Inc.\nPO Box 4668 #23563, New York, NY 10163-4668.\nAll notices to you will be sent to the email or street address provided in your account, if available.\nUpon receipt of such Notice, the receiving party will have a 60 day period in which it may satisfy the Claim against it by fully curing the Claim, providing all the relief requested in the Notice, or entering into a settlement to resolve the Claim to the mutual satisfaction of the parties.\nAfter the expiration of such sixty-day cure period, you or Inquire Network may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nUnless otherwise agreed to by you and Inquire Network in writing, the arbitration will be governed and conducted by JAMS before a single arbitrator with substantial experience in the internet industry and shall follow substantive law in adjudicating the dispute, except that this section shall be construed as a written agreement to arbitrate pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nYou and Inquire Network agree that this section satisfies the writing requirement of the FAA.\nThe arbitration of any claim will be conducted in the State of New York and for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $5,000.00, you shall have the choice as to whether the hearing is conducted in person or by telephone.\nFor those claims that the arbitrator decides are not frivolous, Inquire Network will: (1) pay all costs of the arbitration.\n(2) if you prefer, will conduct the arbitration by telephone, and (3) will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees in the event Inquire Network prevails.\nEach party will pay the fees and costs of its own counsel, experts and witnesses.\nThe JAMS rules are available on its website at www.jamsadr.com.\nTo the extent that this dispute resolution section conflicts with JAMS minimum standards for procedural fairness, the JAMS rules and/or minimum standards for arbitration procedures in that regard shall control.\nNeither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or for the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nand any such suit may be brought only in Federal District Court or, if any such court lacks jurisdiction, in any state court that has jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, or enforceability of these Terms including any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable.\nHowever, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the clause entitled \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exception.</b>\n<br>All parties, including related third parties, shall retain the right to seek adjudication in a small claims tribunal for disputes within the scope of such tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\nAny dispute, which cannot be adjudicated within the jurisdiction of a small claims tribunal, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, with the exception of any Claim or action for indemnification, contribution, interpleader, or injunctive relief arising out of a Claim, which Claims or actions shall not be subject to arbitration.\nAny appeal of a judgment from a small claims tribunal shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Survival.</b>\n<br>This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Severability.</b>\n<br>If any provision of this Section 11 is declared or found by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator to be unlawful, unenforceable or void, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent that it is found unlawful, unenforceable or void, and the remainder of the provision and all other provisions will remain fully enforceable, except that if the Class Action Waiver for any Claim cannot be enforced, then the provision to arbitrate will not apply.\n</p> 12.\nMISCELLANEOUS.\n<p>These Terms and policies incorporated herein are the entire agreement between you and Inquire Network.\nThey supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and Inquire Network relating to your use of the Services.\nInquire Network may assign these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time.\nIf any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, it will not impact any other provision of these Terms, all of which will remain in full force and effect.\nHeadings in the Terms are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation or construction of this agreement.\nThe failure of Inquire Network to partially or fully exercise any rights or the waiver of Inquire Network of any breach of these Terms by you, shall not prevent a subsequent exercise of such right by Inquire Network or be deemed a waiver by Inquire Network of any subsequent breach by you of the same or any other term of these Terms.\nThe rights and remedies of Inquire Network under these Terms and any other applicable agreement between you and Inquire Network shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any such right or remedy shall not limit Inquire Network\u2019 right to exercise any other right or remedy.</p>\n13.\nCONTACT US.\n<p>Please contact us online at
