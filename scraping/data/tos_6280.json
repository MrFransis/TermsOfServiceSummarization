online platform through which you can browse different types of lodging and temporary accommodation, including but not necessarily limited to hotels, hostels, serviced apartments, B&amp;Bs, rooms for rent, cottages, ryokans, etc.\n(collectively, the \u201cAccommodation(s)\u201d) and request to make reservations with such Accommodations, including already making payment for such reservations of Accommodations in advance with a credit card, debit card, e-wallet, or such other payment method to facilitate the processing of such payment (\u201c<strong>Payment Instrument</strong>\u201d).\nBy making a booking through the Site for the Accommodation, you make an offer to book a reservation at the price listed for such reservation and such other terms and conditions stated on the Site.\nThis shall become a binding contract formed in Singapore pursuant to the Terms of Use when accepted by the Accommodation and consequently Agoda.\nYou will receive proof of the confirmed Accommodation booking via an e-mail confirmation (with a voucher for prepaid Accommodations),which means the reservation has been confirmed by the Accommodation.\nThe \u201cthank you page\u201d means your reservation request has been received and is complete for final processing, no further action is required by you.\nWe reserve the right to reject bookings as set out below.</p>\n<p>When rendering our services, the information that we disclose about Accommodations is based on the information provided to us by our suppliers or providers (including but not necessarily limited to the Accommodations, their representatives, distributors, destination management companies (DMCs), channel managers, partners, etc.).\nAs such, the Accommodations or their representatives are given access to an extranet or other connectivity solution through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability, description, pictures, booking conditions, accommodation policies and other information which is displayed on the Site.\nAlthough we will use commercially reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, correct or up to date, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of the Site or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information.\nEach Accommodation remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the Accommodation information displayed on the Site.\nChanges in market conditions or circumstances may occur on short notice which may make information displayed on the Site inaccurate or outdated.\nIn case of problems, our Customer Service will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist you and serve as a point of contact with the Accommodation.\nPlease note that Agoda is one of many channels Accommodations use to make their inventory available for reservation.\nWhen a search result indicates that a particular Accommodation has no more rooms available, that means the room type is not available for reservation through Agoda.</p>\n<p>The Site does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of (the quality, service level or rating of) any Accommodation listed on the Site.\nWe hereby expressly disclaim any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the quality, status or adequacy of any Accommodation listed on the Site.\nThe Accommodations can be ranked on the Site according to different criteria (star rating, reviews, etc.).\nThe default ranking is based on an automated algorithm which may be updated or amended from time to time, and which takes into account different factors including but not necessarily limited to availability, promotions and rates, historical popularity, money earned by Agoda, conversion (the ratio of reservations made to Site visits), sales of room nights, cancellations, quality of content, guest review scores, star ratings etc.\nAgoda currently has a \u201cPreferred Partner\u201d program whereby certain selected Accommodations have the opportunity to improve their visibility on the Site.\nSuch Preferred Partner listings will be marked or contain wording for clarity.\nUnder certain circumstances, Agoda may also offer Accommodations the option of sponsored listings, i.e.\nto pay for a top spot.\nSuch sponsored listings will be marked or contain wording for clarity.</p>\n<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to, and our discretion, refuse or cancel bookings in exceptional cases and will notify you of the refusal or cancellation by email to the address you provided when you made your booking.\nTypical reasons for rejecting or cancelling a booking include, but are not limited to: Accommodation or Partner request(s), actual or suspected reselling of Accommodations booked through the Site on an individual or mass basis without our prior written approval (\u201cReselling\u201d), breach of the Terms of Use, force majeure events, trade or economic sanctions, embargoes, legal restrictions, (suspicions of) fraud or theft, suspected criminal activity, suspicious bookings, submission by you of misleading or erroneous information, Payment Instrument problems, inappropriate behavior, threats, insults, violence, refusal to supply information, practical obstacles, communication problems, obvious errors (see below), history, blacklisting by governments or international organizations (USA, EU, UN, Singapore), etc.\nIf your booking is rejected or cancelled by Agoda and a payment has already been made, you will receive a refund of the total booking value, (except in the case of unauthorized Reselling or in any other appropriate case such as unauthorized use of the Site or there is an inappropriate manner in the use of the Site, and such use is harmful to us for which the refund of the total booking value or any part thereof is not justifiable).\nRefunds will not be issued in the event of unauthorized Reselling due to many negative factors including the disadvantage such practice imposes on our authorized and contracted affiliate partners, Accommodations who provide Agoda with inventory on a contracted and trusted basis and the loss and negative brand impact caused to Agoda due to unauthorized Resellers attempting to undercut Agoda\u2019s business which may include placing the resold inventory on sites run by competitors of Agoda without our knowledge.\nWe also reserve the right to bar (\u201cblacklist\u201d) users from the Site, on a permanent or temporary basis, at our discretion.\nAny such blacklisted user must not attempt to use the Site under any other name or through any other user.\nSee also the section below under the heading <strong>Payment - Credit Card \u2013 \u201cBook Now, Pay Later\u201d \u2013 Age \u2013 Fraud </strong>for more information about our fraud prevention mechanisms.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In rare cases, we may also have to cancel or reject a booking or make adjustments due to \u201cobvious errors\u201d, independent of the origin of such errors.\nFor clarity, an obvious error is a mistake on the Site (e.g.\nin terms of price, conditions, points) which a reasonable person would not consider to be normal.\nIf your booking is affected by an obvious error, we will notify you by email at the address you provided when you made the booking and will adjust the booking or awarded points as appropriate, and will, if &nbsp;relevant, refund some or all of the amount charged.</p>\n<p>Please note that suspected group bookings can also be rejected or cancelled by Agoda or the Accommodation as most Accommodations have specific procedures for group bookings.\nContact our Customer Service team for more information.</p>\n<p>Circumstances such as ongoing renovations, Accommodation booking errors, and specific guest needs can affect the quality of your stay.\nBe sure to let the Accommodation know any special requests or requirements you have at check-in.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A word about star ratings</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Accommodation star, other denoted ratings, or any reference on the Site to a rating on the Site (\u201c<strong>Accommodation Ratings</strong>\u201d) are provided for your information only and are only provided in relation to the Accommodation.\nThe Accommodation Ratings are based on information we have received from our suppliers, including the Accommodations, and may take into account the Accommodation\u2019s facilities, rates, reviews, and services.\nAccommodation Ratings are unrelated to any other ratings assigned by government tourism authorities.\nWe do not independently verify star ratings.\nA star rating is only indicative of the level of comfort you can expect to find in a particular Accommodation, with a higher star rating generally being indicative of a higher level of comfort and amenities.\nFor more detailed information, please check the detailed description on the Site.\nPlease be aware that star ratings can vary greatly on the basis of location, available alternatives, local market conditions, practices or other circumstances.\nThus, it is possible that a star rating in one particular country or city is not comparable to the same star rating in another country or city due to such circumstances.\nStar ratings do not necessarily reflect all the amenities or services that might be available at an Accommodation, and some amenities and features may not be available in every room or at every property with a particular star rating.\nIf there are particular amenities or features that are important to you, please contact our Customer Service and inquire as to the availability of such amenities or features.</p>\n<p>Ratings and reviews for Ancillary Services are not covered by this section and are addressed in B.\nOther Ancillary Services below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nOther Ancillary Services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Agoda provides an online platform through which you can browse other services, including but not necessarily limited to flights, attractions and rental cars, (\u201cAncillary Services\u201d) and make reservations for such Ancillary Services.\nAlthough the Agoda Site provides the platform for which you can browse and make reservations for these Ancillary Services, the Ancillary Services are provided by third parties, Agoda associated companies or partners (\u201cPartners\u201d), which have been selected by Agoda.\nFor example, flight display, search and reservation services on the Agoda Site are currently provided by Booking Holdings Inc.\ncompanies KAYAK or priceline.com and their respective suppliers.\nThe identity of each of our Partners will be displayed on the Site when browsing the Ancillary Services and a link provided to the Partner\u2019s terms and conditions of use and/or privacy policy, which will govern the relationship between you and our Partner for the relevant Ancillary Service reservation.\nWe may be paid a fee or commission if you make a reservation for Ancillary Services.</p>\n<p>By making a booking through the Site for the Ancillary Services, you make an offer to book a reservation (e.g.\nfor flights or a rental car) at the price listed for such reservation on the Site, and on such other terms and conditions notified to you by the Partner from time to time, which shall become a binding contract when your reservation is accepted by the Partner.\nThe Partner will indicate the acceptance of your Ancillary Service booking via an e-mail confirmation to you.\nThe Partner reserves the right to reject bookings as set out in their terms and conditions.\nWe also reserve the right to reject your booking for Ancillary Services in accordance with these terms of use.</p>\n<p>We may display ratings for and reviews of Ancillary Services for your information only.\nThese are provided by the relevant Partner, which is responsible for the content of the ratings and reviews.\nThe ratings and rankings are subject to and governed by the Partner\u2019s terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nUse of the Site</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Agoda also works with other companies, including Booking.com B.V., to offer reservations options in Accommodations worldwide to guests.\nIn some cases, you will receive a confirmation referring to such other companies.\nAgoda may also offer the option to book Ancillary Services (flights, rental cars) in cooperation with selected Partners as described above.</p>\n<p>Agoda grants you a limited, restricted, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to access and use the

rates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that, unless expressly indicated otherwise, all prices on the Site are for room reservations only, for the specified stay dates and number of people.\nWithout prejudice to what is set out below, before you confirm a reservation, Agoda will display the total price payable, including taxes and service fees, and what is included.\nAs you select options or specify additional details, we will update the total price.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nPrices and Best Price Guarantee for Accommodations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We strive to have the most competitive prices and we want you to pay the lowest price possible for your stay at an Accommodation.\nShould you find your Accommodation room reservation, with the same booking conditions, at a lower price on the Internet after you have made a booking through us, we will match the difference between our price and the lower price under the terms and conditions of the Best Price Guarantee.\nFor a claim to be valid under this guarantee, it must satisfy and be submitted in compliance with all relevant terms and conditions of our Best Price Guarantee.\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes cheaper rates are available on the Site for a specific stay at an Accommodation for the same room type, however, these rates made by Accommodations may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund.\nPlease check the room type and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.\nThe same room type may have different rates, depending on such restrictions and conditions (see also section 6 below).</p>\n<p> The Best Price Guarantee does not apply to Ancillary Services provided on the Site.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nAdditional Charges by Accommodations</strong>\n</p>\n<p> In addition to the reservation prices, some Accommodations will charge mandatory service fees, surcharges, and local taxes (for example, resort or amenity fees, transportation transfers, and city tourist tax).\nIf we are aware of these service fees and local taxes, we will display them with your reservation price.\nThese service fees and local taxes may be collected directly from you by the Accommodation, in addition to the price you pay for your reservation.<br>\nStandard room reservations are for single or double occupancy.\nExtra guests or beds will usually incur extra charges.\nAn Accommodation may refuse to allow additional guests to stay in a room \u2013 you must specify the correct number of persons, including children who will occupy each room you reserve.\n</p>\n<p>You will incur additional charges at the Accommodation for all services and products you use that are not included in the reservation price as expressly described by the booking conditions.\nCharges for amenities you use and products you consume during your stay (for example, parking, internet access, food and drink) are not included in the reservation price unless specified.</p>\n<p>During special events and periods, some Accommodations require each guest to purchase additional services (for example, a dinner on New Year\u2019s Eve).\nIf we are aware of a required additional service you must purchase, we will display it in the booking conditions or with your reservation price.</p>\n<p>To travel to Accommodations in some locations (for example, islands in the Maldives), all guests must arrange transportation transfers in advance for an additional fee.\nSome Accommodations require Agoda to collect payment for the transfer when a reservation is made.\nWe will show these additional transfer fees with your total price.\nAgoda does not control or operate transfers, and is not responsible for the quality, safety, frequency, or service levels of the transportation.</p>\n<p> If you are unsure or concerned about additional charges, please verify with the Accommodation or Customer Service which extra fees (if any) are payable in addition to your reservation.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nAdditional Charges for Ancillary Services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that all prices on the Site for Ancillary Services are set by our Partners, unless otherwise indicated.\nPlease refer to the appropriate Partner\u2019s terms and conditions for any additional charges that may be applicable to your reservation (for example, airport tax).</p>\n<p>Your reservation for, and any Ancillary Services you purchase, do not include insurance, unless expressly stated to include insurance.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D.\nCurrency Conversion </strong>\n</p>\n<p>The prices shown in Agoda listings are based on rates set by the properties in their Property Currency.\nYou may choose to view listing prices in the Property Currency or a different Display Currency.\nIf your payment card or account supports it, we may give you the option to select the Charge Currency before you pay for your booking.</p>\n<strong>Definitions</strong>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Account Currency</strong> means the default currency of the payment card or account you use to pay for a booking.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Charge Currency</strong>&nbsp;means the currency in which you are charged for a booking.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Display Currency</strong> means the currency in which you choose to view prices on our Site.&nbsp.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Property Currency</strong> means the currency in which the property or service provider sets the rates for their listings of accommodations or services on our Site and wishes to receive funds from Agoda.\nBy default, the Property Currency is the official currency in the territory where the property or service is located.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Indicated Rate</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate mid-rate on the current day.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Daily Adjusted Rate</strong>&nbsp;\u2013 Bloomberg Generic Composite Rate on the day payment is processed plus a 5% currency conversion charge.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Account provider rates</strong>\n<br>\nIf your Charge Currency is different from your payment account currency, your account provider will determine the exchange rate to use when the transaction is applied to your account.\nYour account provider may offer a higher or lower rate than Agoda, and may charge you additional fees for a foreign transaction.\nAgoda does not control or benefit from your account provider\u2019s exchange rate or fees.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Agoda rates</strong>\n<br> If your Charge Currency is the same as your Account Currency, but different from either the Property Currency or your Display Currency, Agoda will use our Indicated Rate or Daily Adjusted Rate to convert prices.\nThe applicable rate will depend on choices you select when viewing listings and making a booking, as described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Converted currency prices are indicative</strong>\n<br>\nIf you choose a Display Currency that is different from the Property Currency, Agoda will display indicative prices converted using our Indicated Rate.\nThe converted Display Currency price is a preliminary estimate of the price in your Display Currency - it is not firm or binding.\nThe converted price in the Display Currency is provided for your convenience, to allow you to compare different rates, packages, and conditions in the currency you prefer to use.<br>\nBecause room prices are set by properties in the Property Currency, the amount you pay for a booking will depend on three variables:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Charge Currency ;</li>\n<li>whether your booking is Pay Now, Book Now Pay Later, or Pay at Hotel;</li>\n<li>the exchange rate between the Charge Currency and the Property Currency on the day we process your payment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Pay Now bookings</strong>\n<br>\nIf you change the Charge Currency , we will update your total price to show the amount we will process to your payment account.\nWe can do this because we know the exchange rate at that time.\nIf you choose a Charge Currency that is different from the Display Currency, Agoda will use the Daily Adjusted Rate to convert the amount.\nFor all other Pay Now transactions, we will use our Indicated Rate to convert currencies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Book Now Pay Later bookings</strong>\n<br> If your Charge Currency is different from the Property Currency or Display Currency, Agoda will use our Daily Adjusted Rate on your payment date to convert the Property Currency price to your Charge Currency.\nIf you change your Charge Currency , we will show you the price in the Property Currency that will be used to determine the total charge on your payment date and the estimated converted price that you will be charged based on the current Daily Adjusted Rate.\nWe do this because we do not know what the actual exchange rate will be on your payment date.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pay at Hotel bookings</strong>\n<br> When you make a Pay at Hotel booking, we will update your total price to show the amount you will pay in the Property Currency.\nYou will pay the Property directly, in the Property Currency or any other currency the Property agrees to accept.\nIf you pay in a different currency, or with a payment account that uses a different currency, the actual amount you pay will depend on the exchange rate(s) used by the Property and your payment providers.\nThese factors are outside of Agoda\u2019s control.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A Word on Charges for Taxes and Fees</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In connection with facilitating your Accommodation transaction, the charge to your Payment Instrument may include a charge for taxes and fees (\u201cTaxes and Fees\u201d) unless indicated otherwise.\nIn relation to Accommodations, this charge includes an estimated amount to recover the amount Agoda pays to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes owed by the Accommodation including, without limitation, sales and use tax, occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes.\nIn certain locations, the tax amount may also include government-imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing authorities but required by law to be collected by the Accommodation.\nThe amount paid to the Accommodation in connection with your reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we estimate and include in the charge to you.\nThe balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees, if any, is a fee Agoda retains as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs.\nIf the balance is negative, Agoda will absorb such difference.\nThe charge for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount Agoda pays the Accommodation and the location of the Accommodation where you will be staying, and may include profit that Agoda retains.</p>\n<p>Our Accommodation suppliers, as vendors, include all applicable taxes in the amount billed and Agoda pays over such amounts directly to the vendors.\nAgoda is not a co-vendor associated with the vendors with whom we book or reserve your travel arrangements.\nTaxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.</p>\n<p>For transactions involving Accommodations located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your Payment Instrument for Taxes and Fees includes a payment of tax that Agoda is required to collect and remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts Agoda retains as compensation for services.</p>\n<p>For reservations where you need to pay at the Accommodation, the price may or may not include taxes and fees.\nPlease verify the booking conditions and your confirmation mail or voucher or contact our Customer Service team.</p>\n<p> In some locations, Accommodations may be required by local law to charge and collect city, bed, tourist occupancy or equivalent taxes directly.</p>\n<p> Taxes and fees for Ancillary Services you may purchase are described out in our Partner\u2019s terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nPrivacy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We respect your privacy.\nPlease have a look at our Privacy Policy for further information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nPayment - Credit Card \u2013 \u201cBook Now, Pay Later\u201d \u2013 Age - Fraud</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For pre-paid Accommodation bookings with Agoda, you authorize us to collect and process (including the collection and processing through a third party) your information required by processing service providers or the financial institution that issues your Payment Instrument such as a credit or debit card in order to verify your identity.\nPersonal information collected about you and that may be shared to such third parties (including to handle your transaction and/or maintain your account) is set out in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>To complete payment for such pre-paid Accommodation bookings, you authorize Agoda or Related Companies to charge or debit your Payment Instrument for the full price (sometimes without any option for refund depending on the Accommodation\u2019s booking conditions, see below) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking or, in case of a \u201c<strong>Book Now, Pay Later</strong>\u201d booking, at the future point in time communicated in the confirmation email.\nWhen using \u201c<strong>Book Now, Pay Later</strong>\u201d, please ensure that your Payment Instrument is valid and has sufficient credit on the future payment date.\nIf the Payment Instrument cannot be charged on such date for whatever reason, the booking will be cancelled unless you can ensure that the card payment can be authorized on time.\nPlease check the reservation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.\nAgoda or Related Companies will process refunds, if and when applicable, within a reasonable timeframe.You also authorize the crediting to your Payment Instrument in case of reversals, refunds, or adjustments through the service

English language version of the Terms of Use shall prevail.</p>\n<p>The Terms of Use shall be deemed severable.\nIn the event that any provision is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.\nThe severed provisions shall be replaced by a provision approximating as much as possible the original wording and intent.</p>\n<p>Agoda reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to the extent permissible under relevant law to temporarily or permanently modify, suspend, or terminate the Site and/or any portion thereof, including any service or product available through the Site,

conflict of laws rules.\nAny dispute arising out of the Terms of Use or otherwise connected to Agoda\u2019s services must exclusively be submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction in Singapore.\nThe <em>Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 2001</em> (Cap.\n53B) is expressly excluded and will not apply to the Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>\n<u>(B)</u>\n<strong>\n<u> For US customers only:</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This part of Section 14 only applies to US customers.\nPlease read this section carefully.\nIt affects rights that you may otherwise have.\nIt provides for resolution of most disputes through binding arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.\nThis arbitration clause will survive termination of this Section.</p>\n<p>This provision is intended to be given the broadest interpretation and application to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to your relationship with Agoda, including the use of our website, our services and any other interactions with us.\nAgoda is committed to customer satisfaction.\nWe will try to resolve any concerns or problems with our services that you may have.\nIf we are unsuccessful, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Section and your relationship with Agoda or any subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you may opt out of this binding arbitration provision within 30 days after this Section comes into effect (the \"Opt Out Deadline\").\nThis will be the earliest of (a) the date you first used our website, (b) the date you first used our services or (c) the date you started a relationship with us.\nYou may opt out of these arbitration procedures by sending us a written notice using any of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By email to arbitration.optout@agoda.com with the subject line: <strong>Terms of Use \u2013 US Opt Out Notice</strong>.</li>\n<li>By regular mail or courier to our registered address at Legal Department, Agoda Company Pte.\nLtd., 30 Cecil Street, Prudential Tower #19-08, Singapore 049712.</li>\n<li>Using our online customer service form at this link.\nThis option is supported if you have made a booking through Agoda and have a confirmation number.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We must receive your opt out notice no later than 3 days after the Opt Out Deadline for it to be valid.\nYou agree that you must pursue any claim in arbitration or small claims court if we do not receive an opt-out notice from you, or if we receive an opt-out notice from you more than 3 days after the Opt Out Deadline.\n<br> For all disputes, whether pursued in arbitration or small claims court, you must first send a written description of your claim to us to allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute.\nYou and we each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith.\nYou may request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be resolved within 60 days.\nYou must send us written notice of the claim using either of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By email to arbitration.optout@agoda.com with the subject line: <strong>Terms of Use \u2013 US Dispute Notice</strong>.</li>\n<li>By regular mail or courier to our registered address at Legal Department, Agoda Company Pte.\nLtd., 30 Cecil Street, Prudential Tower #19-08, Singapore 049712.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The arbitration of any dispute or claim will be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Section.\nThe AAA Rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org.&nbsp.\nTo the extent of any inconsistency, this Section will supersede and govern over the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>You and we agree that this Section evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, and not governed by state law.\nAny arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient location in the state in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language.\nAn arbitrator may award any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the extent required to satisfy your claim, as well as afford public injunctive relief where such claims are permitted and cannot be waived by applicable law, and must follow and enforce this Section as a court would.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.\nJudgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>We agree that we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees other than the initial filing fee that you must pay to file the initial arbitration demand, and if your claim is for less than $1,000 we will reimburse you for the filing fee if you provide a written request for reimbursement.\nOtherwise, we will each bear the fees and expense of our respective attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, you and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, except for actions for injunctive relief as described below.\nIf a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the arbitration Section will be void as to you.\nIf you opt out of the arbitration provision as specified above, this class action waiver provision will not apply to you.\nNeither you, nor any other customer, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out procedure set forth above.\nNotwithstanding the above Terms of Use, nothing in this Section will be construed to waive any right you have under applicable law to pursue a claim for injunctive relief with the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public.\nAny such public injunctive relief claims are preserved and will be subject to arbitration.\nTo the extent permitted by applicable law, any determination of the extent to which your claims qualify as seeking public injunctive relief will be heard and decided by the arbitrator.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nAbout Agoda</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All of our online reservations services rendered through the Site are provided by Agoda Company Pte.\nLtd., which is a
