us.\nWe\u2019ll only ever access your account with your permission to help you with a problem or fix a software bug.\nWe\u2019ll never open any uploaded files unless you specificly ask us to.</p>\nIdentity and access\n<p>When you sign up for Taskulu, we ask for your email address.\nIf you sign up using Google or Github, we\u2019ll also get your name from the respective service.\nIt\u2019s just so we can personalize your new account and that we can send you invoices, updates and other essential information.\nWe\u2019ll never sell your personal info to other third parties and we won\u2019t use your name or company in a marketing statement without your permission either.</p>\n<p>When you write to Taskulu with a question or to ask for help, we\u2019ll keep that correspondence and the email address for future reference.</p>\n<p>When you visit our marketing pages, we track that for statistical purposes (like testing new designs and optimizing conversion rates).\nWe also keep any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.</p>\n<p>The only times we\u2019ll ever share your info:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide products or services you\u2019ve asked for \u2013 with your permission.</li>\n<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.</li>\n<li>If Taskulu is acquired by or merged with another company we\u2019ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>\nLaw enforcement\n<p>Taskulu won\u2019t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to.\nWe flat out reject requests from local or international law enforcement when they seek data without a court order, and unless we\u2019re legally prevented from it, we\u2019ll always inform you when such requests are made.</p>\nEncryption\n<p>All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when sent from our servers to your browser.\nThe database backups are also encrypted.\nData is not encrypted while it lives in our database, but we go to great lengths to secure your data.</p>\nDeleted data\n<p>When you cancel your account, we\u2019ll ensure that none of your data (i.e.\neverything in the projects you\u2019ve created) is saved on our servers after 30 days.\nPlease note that if you\u2019ve been added to another project and created tasks on the other project, deleting your account won\u2019t delete those tasks as they are considered part of a project that\u2019s owned by someone else.</p>\nCookie usage\nWhat Are Cookies\n<p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which
