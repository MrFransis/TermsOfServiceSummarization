personal information, either directly or indirectly, from you when you use this Application.</p>\n<p>For example, you directly provide your personal information when you submit requests via any forms

we collect: sharing and disclosing of your personal information with third parties for a business purpose\n<p>We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a third party for

electronic means, a consumer's personal information by the business to <strong>another business or a third party, for monetary or other valuable consideration</strong>\u201d.</p>\n<p>This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network plugins and the like.</p> Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information\n<p>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.\nThis means that whenever you request us to stop selling your

other reasons such as for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section \u201cDetailed information on the processing of Personal Data\u201d within this document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our rights before the competent authorities where our rights and interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.</p>\n<p>We will not use your personal information for different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without notifying you.</p> Your California privacy rights and how to exercise them The right to know and to portability\n<p>You have the right to request that we disclose to you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the categories and sources of the personal information that we collect about you, the purposes for which we use your information and with whom such information is shared;</li>\n<li> in case of sale of personal information or disclosure for a business purpose, two separate lists where we disclose: <ul>\n<li>for sales, the personal information categories purchased by each category of recipient.\nand </li>\n<li>for disclosures for a business purpose, the personal information categories obtained by each category of recipient.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The disclosure described above will be limited to the personal information collected or used over the past 12 months.</p>\n<p>If we deliver our response electronically, the information enclosed will be \"portable\", i.e.\ndelivered in an easily usable format to enable you to transmit the information to another entity without hindrance \u2013 provided that this is technically feasible.</p> The right to request the deletion of your personal information\n<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as, including but not limited to, where the information is used to identify and repair errors on this Application, to detect security incidents and protect against fraudulent or illegal activities, to exercise certain rights etc.).</p>\n<p>If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right, we will delete your personal information and direct any of our service providers to do so.</p> How to exercise your rights\n<p>To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided in this document.</p>\n<p>For us to respond to your request, it\u2019s necessary that we know who you are.\nTherefore, you can only exercise the above rights by making a verifiable request which must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;</li>\n<li>describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our possession actually relates to you.</p>\n<p>If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State to act on your behalf.</p>\n<p>If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of a minor under your parental authority.</p>\n<p>You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12 months.</p> How and when we are expected to handle your request\n<p>We will confirm receipt of your verifiable request within 10 days and provide information about how we will process your request.</p>\n<p>We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt.\nShould we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why, and how much more time we need.\nIn this regard, please note that we may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.</p>\n<p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>\n<p>Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind our denial.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.\nIn such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the request.\nIn either case, we will communicate our choices and explain the reasons behind it.</p> Definitions and legal references Personal Data (or Data) <p>Any information that directly, indirectly, or in connection with other information \u2014 including a personal identification number

acceptance of the Order.\nThe contract shall be concluded at the time of the Order Confirmation by the Owner to the email address provided by the User.\nThe Owner reserves the right not to confirm an order, should one or more of the Services purchased be unavailable.\nIn this case, the Owner will notify the User about the unavailability of the Services purchased within 5 working days from order

cases, the subscription plan will be automatically updated to the level that fits the User\u2019s needs in order to ensure the continuity of the provision of the Service.</p>\n<p>The methods of payment used correspond to the payment method the User has chosen for subscribing to the original plan.\nThe User is obliged to check that these payment methods are valid in order to allow the automatic update of the subscription plan to function properly.\nIf the payment methods chosen by the User result unfit or unsuitable for use, the Owner may be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.</p>\n<p>The User is free to turn off this automatic upgrade feature through the Service interface or by contacting the Owner.\nIn this case, however, if the User exceeds the maximum use thresholds as set forth in the chosen subscription plan and fails to independently perform the update to the respective necessary plan, the Owner might be forced to suspend the provision of the Service.<br>\nIn any case, the Owner will attempt to do its best to alert the User via email upon approaching the maximum use thresholds and, therefore, about the need to update the current subscription plan.</p> Disabling the service, withdrawal and refund <p>Users may discontinue the Service at any time using the tools provided in the interface of this Application or by contacting the

contact information provided on this Application.</p> Methods of payment <p>This Application uses third-party tools for its payment processing and is not connected with any of the provided payment information \u2013 such as the credit card \u2013 in any way.<br>If the owner of any of such third-party tools refuses to authorize a payment, the Owner cannot provide the Service and will therefore not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver.</p> Duration <p>The duration of the Service is indicated at the moment of payment of the price and confirmed in the Order Confirmation email sent by the Owner.</p> Changing the payment plan <p>Users are free to change the chosen payment plan at any time.<br> In case the User modifies their current payment plan, the portion of the previous plan that has not yet been used shall be converted into a bonus which can be applied to the plan the User is switching to, on a pro-rata basis and in the form of a free period.<br> If a currency conversion is required, the exchange rate criteria set forth in the specific paragraph of the present document shall apply.</p> Currency conversion <p>The exchange rate is the one established by the payment
