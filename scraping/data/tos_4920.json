why this is not possible.\nIn some cases, we may also charge you an administrative fee to provide access to your Personal Information.\nAny fees will be reasonable and before we provide access to your

consent or for the execution of a contract, you have the right to ask us to provide you with the data concerning you and held by us in a structured format, commonly used and legible, as well, where
