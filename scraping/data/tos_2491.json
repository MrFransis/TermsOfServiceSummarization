entitled \u201cDispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration\u201d is referred to in these Terms of Service as the \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Gfycat, whether relating to these Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship between us, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\nYou agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Gfycat are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nYour rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief</strong>\n</p>\n<p>YOU AND GFYCAT AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND GFYCAT AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Gfycat is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by emailing customer support at (contact at gfycat dot com.\nIf such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to Gfycat should be sent to [943 Howard Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, Attn: Legal] (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought.\nIf Gfycat and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Gfycat may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Gfycat or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Gfycat is entitled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (\u201cAAA\u201d) rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.\nFor information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.\nInformation about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\u2019s consumer arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration.\nIf there is any inconsistency between the AAA Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.\nAlthough arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.</p>\n<p>Unless Gfycat and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, Gfycat agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nCosts of Arbitration</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Gfycat will pay all Arbitration Fees.\nIf the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Gfycat will pay your portion of such fees.\nIn addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Gfycat will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nFinally, if the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, Gfycat will pay reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees should you prevail.\nGfycat will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees from you.\nBut, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in relief, the payment of attorneys\u2019 fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Confidentiality</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a court decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement other than the section entitled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d above is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.\nIf a court decides that any of the provisions of the section entitled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d above is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Gfycat agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending Gfycat written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Termination</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that Gfycat, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Gfycat believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service.\nAny suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nGfycat may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice.\nYou agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Gfycat may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service.\nFurther, you agree that Gfycat will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User Disputes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and Gfycat will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto.\nGfycat reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Gfycat and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Gfycat with respect to the Service.\nYou also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software.\nThese Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.\nWith respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Gfycat agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within Santa Clara County, California.\nThe failure of Gfycat to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\nIf any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force and effect.\nYou agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.\nA printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.\nYou may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of Gfycat, but Gfycat may assign or transfer this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction.\nThe section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.\nNotices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.\nThe Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Privacy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>At Gfycat, we respect the privacy of our users.\nFor details please see our Privacy Policy.\nBy using the
