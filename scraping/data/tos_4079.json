reasonably designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of our users' data;</li>\n<li>is appropriate to the nature, size, and complexity of Stingle Photos business operations;</li>\n<li>includes incident response and data breach notification processes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the event of a data breach that affects your User Personal Information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach and notify any affected users.</p>\n<p>Transmission of data on Stingle Photos is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS.\nBy design, your photos and videos information is encrypted prior to being transmitted to our servers and is therefore encrypted at rest.</p> Stingle Photos global privacy practices <p>We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement.\nHowever, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries'.</p>\n<p>We provide the same standard of privacy protection \u2014 as described in this Privacy Statement \u2014 to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide.\nWe work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business.</p>\n<p>Stingle Photos by design have no visibility on your photos and videos.\nThey are encrypted on client side and only you have the keys to decrypt them.\nWe store only encrypted blobs of data that CAN\u2019T be deciphered both by us and any third

Information we have collected.</li>\n</ul> How we respond to compelled disclosure <p>Stingle Photos may disclose information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order.\nBecause Stingle Photos by design encrypts everything with a key that only user has, disclosing information generally will be unusable (if you have sufficiently strong password or have chosen not to backup your keys).</p> How we, and others, communicate with you <p>We will use your email address to communicate with you.\nFor example, if you contact our support team with a request, we will respond to you via email.</p>\n<p>Stingle Photos may occasionally send notification emails about new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support.\nThere's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the emails we send you.\nPlease note that you can not opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as email confirmation, from our support team or system emails.</p> Changes to our Privacy Statement <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Stingle Photos may
