protection, for instance by entering into standard contractual clauses for the transfer of data as approved by the European Commission (Art.\n46 GDPR), or we will ask you for your prior consent to such international data transfers.</p>\n<p>We have implemented safeguards to ensure an adequate level of data protection where your personal information is transferred to countries outside the EEA, such as:</p>\n<p>(a) the recipient country has an adequacy decision from the European Commission;</p>\n<p>(b) the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal information;</p>\n<p>(c) Zendesk has Binding Corporate Rules in place which guarantee an adequate level of data protection wherever your data is physically kept.\nor</p>\n<p>(d) Zendesk participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework.\nhowever, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism to transfer personal information from the EU, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.\nWhere the recipient is located in the United States, it may be a certified participant of the EU-US Privacy Shield or Swiss Privacy Shield Framework.</p>\n<p>You can obtain more details of the protection given to your personal information when it is transferred outside Europe (including a sample copy of the model contractual clauses) by contacting us using the details set out at Clause 15 below.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Binding Corporate Rules:</em>\n</p>\n<p>We have adopted Binding Corporate Rules that have been authorised by the EU data protection authorities, and which enable us to transfer personal information lawfully from EEA member states to other Zendesk Group companies around the world.\nMore

here.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Privacy Shield Frameworks:</em>\n</p>\n<p>Zendesk abides by and has certified adherence to the principles of the EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield frameworks as set forth by

information on the Privacy Shield frameworks, and to view the scope of Zendesk\u2019s certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/list.\nUnder certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\nFor residual Privacy Shield disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above, you may be able to invoke a binding arbitration process under certain conditions.\nTo find out more about the Privacy Shield\u2019s binding arbitration scheme, please

transparency, this Policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies on our Websites.\nFor the purposes of this Policy, the term, \u201cWebsites\u201d, shall refer collectively to www.zendesk.com as well as the other websites that the Zendesk Group operates and that link to this Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nDoes Zendesk use Cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Yes.\nThe Zendesk Group and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use cookies and other technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Websites has the best possible experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhat is a Cookie?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive by a web page server.\nCookies contain information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.\nSome of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used.\nYou can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list below.\nWe update this list quarterly, so there may be additional cookies that are not yet listed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nWhy does Zendesk use Cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit our Websites, we may place a number of cookies in your browser.\nThese are known as First Party Cookies and are required to enable to hold session information as you navigate from page to page within the website.\nFor example, we use cookies on our Websites to understand visitor and user preferences, improve their experience, and track and analyze usage, navigational and other statistical information.</p>\n<p>We may use web beacons, tags, flash cookies, HTML5, and scripts in the Websites or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.\nWe may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics providers on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>\n<p>We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites.\nOur third party partners may also use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, flash, HTML5, scripts, or other tracking technologies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests.\nIf you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here and here (or if located in the European Union you may opt into the use of cookies, by clicking here).\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic, untargeted ads.</p>\n<p>Interest-Based Advertising \u2013 As described in this Policy, we and third parties may wish to use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information and infer your interests for interest-based advertising purposes.\nYou can manage your preferences with regards to the receipt of tailored advertisements in the cookie settings described below.\nPlease note if these cookies are switched off, you will continue to see advertisements, but they will no longer be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nHow to disable Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level.\nIf you elect not to activate the cookie or to later
