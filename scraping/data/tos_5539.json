any processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between the parties.\nCustomer shall ensure its instructions are lawful and that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with such instructions will not violate Privacy Laws.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a processor of Personal Data acting on behalf of a third party controller then where legally required we are entitled to follow the instructions of such third party controllers with respect to their Personal Data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Prohibition on Sensitive

an instruction to us to delete Personal Data from our systems in accordance with our standard processes and applicable law.\nWe will comply with this instruction as soon as reasonably practicable, but in all events in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Deletion When Term Expires.<p>When the Term expires, we will destroy any Personal Data in our possession or control.\nThis requirement

requirements.\nYou are solely responsible for complying with any incident notification laws that may apply to you, and to fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Data

Security Responsibilities.<p>You agree that, without prejudice to our obligations under Sections 4.1 or 4.2: (i) you are solely responsible for your use of the Service, including making appropriate

basis) to all reasonable requests for information necessary to confirm our compliance with this DPA, provided that you will not exercise this right more than once per calendar year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Independent Audits.</em> While it is the parties\u2019 intention to rely ordinarily on the provision of the above audit report(s) to verify our compliance with this DPA, we will allow an internationally-recognized independent auditor that you select to conduct audits to verify our compliance with our obligations under this DPA.\nYou must send any requests for audits under this Section 4.4.2 to legal@sentry.io.\nFollowing our receipt of your request, the parties will discuss and agree in advance on the reasonable start date, scope, duration, and security and confidentiality controls applicable to the audit.\nYou will be responsible for any costs associated with the audit.\nYou agree not to exercise your audit rights under this Section 4.4.2 more than

Laws.\nand (ii) any other correspondence, enquiry or complaint received from a data subject, supervisory authority or other third party in connection with the processing of the Customer Data.\nIn the event that any such request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint is made directly to us, we will promptly inform you of it, and provide you with as much detail as reasonably possible.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Data Transfers.<ol>\n<li>Data Storage and Processing Facilities.<p>You agree that we may, subject to Section 6.2, store and process Customer Data in the United States and any other country in which we or our Subprocessors maintain data processing operations.\nSentry shall ensure that such transfers are made in compliance with applicable Privacy Laws and this DPA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Transfers of Data out of Europe.<p>If the storage and/or processing of Personal Data as described in Section 6.1 involves a transfer of Personal Data to Sentry outside of Europe, and European Data Protection Legislation applies to the transfer (collectively, \u201cTransferred Personal Data\u201d), then (i) the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be incorporated into and form a part of this DPA in accordance with Section 6.3.\nand (ii) for so long as Sentry is self-certified to the Privacy Shield we shall continue to process Transferred Personal Data in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles.\nWith respect to Transferred Personal Data, you agree that if we adopt an alternative data transfer mechanism (including any new version of, or successor to, the Standard Contractual Clauses or Privacy Shield adopted pursuant to applicable European Data Protection Legislation) for Transferred Personal Data not described in this DPA (\u201cAlternative Transfer Solution\u201d), the Alternative Transfer Solution shall apply instead of the transfer mechanisms described in this DPA (but only to the extent such Alternative Transfer Solution complies with applicable European Data Protection Legislation and extends to the territories to which Transferred Personal Data is transferred), and if we request that you take any action (including, without limitation, execution of documents) reasonably required to give full effect to that solution, you will promptly do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Standard Contractual Clauses.<p>For the purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the parties agree that (i) Sentry is the \u201cdata importer\u201d and you are the \u201cdata exporter\u201d.\n(ii) the EU SCCs shall be incorporated in the form attached hereto and the UK SCCs shall be incorporated by reference.\n(iii) the Annexes or Appendices of the EU SCCs and UK SCCs (as applicable) shall be populated with the information from Annexes I, II and III of this DPA.\nand (iv) the EU SCCs shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland and the UK SCCs shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales.\nIt is not the intention of either party to contradict or restrict any of the provisions set forth in the Standard Contractual Clauses and, accordingly, if and to the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses conflict with any provision of the Agreement (including this DPA), the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.\nIn particular, nothing in the DPA shall exclude the rights of third-party beneficiaries granted under the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nYou agree that in the event we cannot ensure compliance with the Standard Contractual Clauses, we will inform you promptly and you will provide us with a reasonable period of time to cure any non-compliance.\nYou will reasonably cooperate with us to agree what additional safeguards or measures, if any, may be reasonably required to cure the non-compliance and will only be entitled to suspend the transfer of Personal Data and/or terminate the affected parts of the Service if we have not or cannot cure the non-compliance before the end of the cure period.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Subprocessors.<ol>\n<li>Consent to Engagement.<p>You authorize us to engage third parties as Subprocessors.\nWhenever we engage a Subprocessor, we will enter into a contract with that Subprocessor which imposes data protection terms that require the Subprocessor to protect Personal Data to an equivalent standard required under this DPA, and we shall remain responsible for the Subprocessor\u2019s compliance with the obligations of this DPA and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause us to breach any of our obligations under this DPA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>List of Subprocessors.<p>A list of our current Subprocessors is set out in Annex III.\nWe may update the list of Subprocessors upon thirty (30) days\u2019 prior written notice to you, during which period you will have the opportunity to object as described in Section 7.3 below.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Objections.\nSole Remedy.<p>During the thirty (30) day period beginning on the date we notify you of any new or replacement Subprocessor, you have the right to object to the appointment of that Subprocessor on reasonable grounds that the Subprocessor does not or cannot comply with the requirements set forth in this DPA (each, an \u201cObjection\u201d).\nIf we do not remedy or provide a reasonable workaround for your Objection within a reasonable time, you may, as your sole remedy and our sole liability for your Objection, terminate the Agreement for your convenience, and without further liability to either party.\nWe will not owe you a refund of any fees you have paid in the event you decide to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Disclosure of Subprocessor agreements.<p>You agree that by complying with this Section 7, we fulfil our obligations under Clause 9(a) and (b) of the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nYou further acknowledge that, for the purposes of Clause 9(c) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, we may be restricted from disclosing Subprocessor agreements to you (or the relevant third party controller) due to confidentiality restrictions.\nNotwithstanding this, we shall use reasonable efforts to require Subprocessors to permit us to disclose Subprocessor agreements to you and, in any event, will provide (upon request and on a confidential basis) all information we reasonably can in connection with such Subprocessor agreement.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Additional Information.<p>You acknowledge that we are required under European Data Protection Legislation (i) to collect and maintain records of certain information, including, among other things, the name and contact detail of each processor and/or controller on whose behalf we are acting and, where applicable, of such processor\u2019s or controller\u2019s local representative and data protection officer.\nand (ii) to make such information available to the supervisory authorities.\nAccordingly, if European Data Protection Legislation applies to the processing of Personal Data, you will, when requested, provide this additional information to us, and ensure that the information is kept accurate and up-to-date.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Data Protection Impact Assessment.<p>We will provide you with reasonable and timely assistance as you may require in order to conduct a data protection impact assessment and, if necessary, consult with the relevant data protection authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous.<p>With the exception of the third-party beneficiary rights granted (where applicable) under the Standard Contractual Clauses, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this DPA.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, nothing in this DPA will be deemed to waive or modify any of the provisions of the Agreement, which otherwise remains in full force and effect.\nSpecifically, nothing in this DPA will affect any of the terms of the Agreement relating to Sentry\u2019s limitations of liability, which will remain in full force and effect.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall either party exclude or limit its liability with respect to any data subject\u2019s rights under European Data Protection Legislation or the Standard Contractual Clauses.\nIf you have entered into more than one Agreement with us, this DPA will amend each of the Agreements separately.\nIn the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this DPA and the terms of the Agreement, the terms of this DPA will control.\nThis DPA amends and supersedes any prior data processing addendum or similar agreement regarding its subject matter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Change in Privacy Laws.<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement (including this DPA), in the event of a change in Privacy Laws or a determination or order by a supervisory authority or competent court affecting this DPA or the lawfulness of any processing activities under this DPA, we reserve the right to make any amendments to this DPA as are reasonably necessary to ensure continued compliance with European Data Protection Legislation or compliance with any such orders.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>Standard Contractual ClausesMODULE TWO: Transfer

shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter.\nThe data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Purpose limitation<p>The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Transparency<p>On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge.\nTo the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights.\nOn request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.\nThis Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Accuracy<p>If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data

of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies.\nUntil the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses.\nIn case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.\nThis is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).</p>\n</li>\n<li>Security of

including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter \u201cpersonal data breach\u201d).\nIn assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects.\nThe Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner.\nIn case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter.\nIn complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II.\nThe data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data

mitigate its adverse effects.\nThe data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach.\nSuch notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.\nWhere, and in so far as,

activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter\u2019s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance.\nIn deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor.\nAudits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where

importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, and any additional documented instructions from the data exporter.\nSuch additional instructions shall not conflict with the instructions from the controller.\nThe controller or data exporter may give further documented instructions regarding the data processing throughout the duration of the contract.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.\nWhere the data importer is unable to follow the instructions from the controller, the data exporter shall immediately notify the controller.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the

applicable limitations and safeguards;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>MODULE TWO: Transfer Controller to Processor<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g.\ntechnical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation.\nThe data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so.\nIn this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses.\nIf the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.\nWhere the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer

controller.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible.\nThe data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authorities, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).\n(module three: The data exporter shall forward the information to the controller.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent suspensory authority on request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Review of legality and data minimisation<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity.\nThe data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal.\nWhen challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits.\nIt shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules.\nThese requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter.\nIt shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.\n(module three: The data exporter shall make the assessment available to the controller.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>SECTION IV \u2014

compliance are top priorities for Sentry because they are fundamental to your experience with the product.\nSentry is committed to securing your application\u2019s data, eliminating systems vulnerability, and ensuring continuity of access.</p>\n<p>Sentry uses a variety of industry-standard technologies and services to secure your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and loss.\nAll Sentry employees undergo background checks before employment and are trained on security practices during company onboarding and on an annual basis.</p>\n<p>Security is directed by Sentry\u2019s Chief Technology Officer and maintained by Sentry\u2019s Security &amp.\nOperations team.</p>Infrastructure and Network SecurityPhysical Access Control<p>Sentry is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.\nGoogle data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom-designed electronic access cards</li>\n<li>Alarms</li>\n<li>Vehicle access barriers</li>\n<li>Perimeter fencing</li>\n<li>Metal detectors</li>\n<li>Biometrics</li>\n</ul>\n<p>According to the Google Security Whitepaper: \u201cThe data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection.\nData centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders.\nAccess logs, activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs.\nData centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training.\u201d</p>\n<p>Sentry employees do not have physical access to Google data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.</p>Logical Access Control<p>Sentry is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Sentry operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.\nSpecific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.</p>Penetration Testing<p>Sentry undergoes annual penetration testing conducted by an independent, third-party agency.\nFor testing, Sentry provides the agency with an isolated clone of sentry.io and a high-level diagram of application architecture.\nNo customer data is exposed to the agency through penetration testing.</p>\n<p>Information about any security vulnerabilities successfully exploited through penetration testing is used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.\nA summary of penetration test findings is available upon request to enterprise customers.</p>Third-Party Audit<p>Google Cloud Platform undergoes various third-party independent audits regularly and can provide verification of compliance controls for its data centers, infrastructure, and operations.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, SSAE 16-compliant SOC 2 certification and ISO 27001 certification.\nSentry undergoes regular third-party independent audits on a regular basis and can provide its SOC 2 report upon request.</p>Intrusion Detection and Prevention<p>Unusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Sentry\u2019s most significant concerns for infrastructure hosting and management.\nSentry and Google Cloud Platform\u2019s intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based security and algorithm-based security to identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.</p>\n<p>IDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.</p>\n<p>Sentry does not provide direct access to security event forensics but does provide access to the engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.</p>Business Continuity and Disaster RecoveryHigh Availability<p>Every part of the Sentry service uses properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in the case of failure.\nAs part of regular maintenance, servers are taken out of operation without impacting availability.</p>Business Continuity<p>Sentry keeps hourly encrypted backups of data in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform.\nWhile never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores lost), we will restore organizational data from these backups.</p>Disaster Recovery<p>In the event of a region-wide outage, Sentry will bring up a duplicate environment in a different Google Cloud Platform region.\nThe Sentry operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.</p>Data FlowData into System<p>SDKs securely send events, containing information on errors and exceptions, to the Sentry server, which processes and stores the events.\nAudit data of processing and storing is transmitted to our in-house logging infrastructure through encrypted connections.</p>\n<p>We believe SDKs should provide some mechanism for proactively scrubbing data, ideally through an extensible interface that the user can customize.\nSentry provides documentation outlining SDK configuration to filter out bits of data for security and privacy purposes, but that otherwise delivers the rest of the event data intact.\nScrubbing the following values is recommended:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Values where the keyname matches password, passwd, or secret</li>\n<li>Values that match the regular expression of r\u2019^(?:\\d[ -]*?){13,16}\\$\u2019 (credit card-like)</li>\n<li>Session cookies</li>\n<li>Authentication header (HTTP)</li>\n</ul>Data through System<p>Data is sent securely to Sentry via TLS to an HTTPS endpoint.\nAll data is AES-256bit encrypted, both in transit and at rest.\nSentry aggregates events along with contextual data related to the user\u2019s environment, preceding events, and the release and deployment changeset.\nEvents data is also enriched with artifacts like source maps or symbols uploaded by the user or sourced externally.</p>\n<p>Sentry\u2019s latest SSL Labs Report can be found here.</p>Data out of System<p>Once the event is processed, it can then be accessed via Sentry\u2019s user interface and REST APIs.\nSentry integrates with a variety of third-party tools so developers can combine error data from Sentry with data from other systems, manage workflows efficiently, and be alerted of errors through notification and chat tools, in addition to email and SMS.\nTherefore, Sentry\u2019s high standards for security and compliance also extend to its partner network.</p>Data Security and PrivacyData Encryption<p>All data in Sentry servers is encrypted at rest.\nGoogle Cloud Platform stores and manages data cryptography keys in its redundant and globally distributed Key Management Service.\nSo, if an intruder were ever able to access any of the physical storage devices, the Sentry data contained therein would still be impossible to decrypt without the keys, rendering the information a useless jumble of random characters.</p>\n<p>Encryption at rest also enables continuity measures like backup and infrastructure management without compromising data security and privacy.</p>\n<p>Sentry exclusively sends data over HTTPS transport layer security (TLS) encrypted connections for additional security as data transits to and from the application.</p>Data Retention<p>Sentry retains event data for 90 days by default, regardless of plan.\nWe remove individual events after 90 days, and we remove aggregate issues after 90 days of inactivity.\nAll event data and most metadata is eradicated from the service and from the server without additional archiving in order to prevent the threat of intrusion.</p>Data Removal<p>All customer data stored on Sentry servers is eradicated upon a customer\u2019s termination of service and deletion of account after a 24-hour waiting period to prevent accidental cancellation.\nData can also be deleted upon request and via Sentry\u2019s REST API and UI.</p>\n<p>Users have the ability to remove individual events via bulk delete of all events within an issue and can permanently remove data related to a given tag.</p>PII Scrubbing<p>We recommend that users do not send any personally identifiable information (PII) to Sentry.\nTo mitigate accidents and other security risks, Sentry offers server-side filtering as a default setting.\nThe Data Scrubber option in Sentry\u2019s settings ensures PII doesn\u2019t get sent to or stored on Sentry\u2019s servers, automatically removing values that appear to be sensitive information.</p>\n<p>Additionally, users can specify values to be scrubbed in the Project Settings.\nIP Address storage can also be disabled.\nThe latter is particularly important if you\u2019re concerned about PII and using Sentry\u2019s Browser JavaScript SDK.</p>Application SecurityTwo-Factor Authentication<p>In addition to password login, two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an added layer of security to Sentry via a time-based one-time password algorithm (TOTP).\nWe encourage 2FA as an important step towards securing data access from intruders.\nSentry users can deploy universal second-factor devices like YubiKeys (which can also be used to confirm the sudo prompt), TOTP apps like Google Authenticator, or SMS as second factors.\nThis also applies to sign-in with an SSO provider.</p>\n<p>Sentry\u2019s organization list also displays who has 2FA enabled so users can vet their own organization\u2019s security.</p>Single Sign-On<p>Sentry\u2019s single sign-on (SSO) implementation prioritizes security.\nWe aggressively monitor linked accounts and disable them with any reasonable sign that the account\u2019s access has been revoked.\nSSO also improves user experience by streamlining login and improving access from trusted domains.\nSentry currently offers SSO via Google Apps for Work and GitHub Organizations.</p>SAML 2.0<p>To facilitate user authentication through the web browser and improve identity management, Sentry offers assertion markup language (SAML)-based SSO as a standard feature to customers on its Enterprise plan.\nSAML 2.0 enhances user-based security and streamlines signup and login from trusted portals to enhance user experience, access management, and auditability.</p>\n<p>Sentry integrates with SAML 2.0 providers including OneLogin, Auth0, and Okta (as well as enhanced member administration and management on the Medium and Large plans via an integration with Rippling).</p>REST API Authentication (API Key)<p>Sentry\u2019s REST API uses an auth token for authentication.\nAuthentication tokens are passed using the auth header and are used to authenticate a user account with the API.</p>\n<p>We strongly recommend using organization-wide authentication tokens.</p>Email Security<p>The Sentry service includes email notifications and reports.\nSender policy framework (SPF) is a system to prevent email address spoofing and minimize inbound spam.\nWe have SPF records set through Dyn, our domain name service (DNS), and domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance (DMARC) set up for monitoring reports to prevent the possibility of phishing scams.\nSentry users can see the TXT records on dmarc.getsentry.com and md.getsentry.com:</p>\n<code>\\$ dig \\_dmarc.getsentry.com TXT +short \"v=DMARC1\\.\np=none\\.\npct=100\\.\nrua=mailto:re+tlipc5xia1x@dmarc.postmarkapp.com\\.\nsp=none\\.\naspf=r\\;\" \\$ dig md.getsentry.com TXT +short \"v=spf1 ip4:167.89.86.73 ip4:167.89.84.14 ip4:167.89.84.75 -all\"\n</code>Audit Controls<p>We know user administration is central to security and management, and auditing user logs is often the first step in both an emergency response plan and policy compliance requirements.\nAll Sentry customers get admin controls governing identity, access, and usage to keep your data safe, secure, and centrally managed.</p>\n<p>Membership within Sentry is handled at the organization level.\nThe system is designed so each user has a singular account that can be reused across multiple organizations (even those using SSO).\nEach Sentry user should have their own account and can choose their own personal preferences and notifications settings.\nAccess to organizations is dictated by role:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Billing</li>\n<li>Member</li>\n<li>Admin</li>\n<li>Manager</li>\n<li>Organization Owner</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any organization on a Sentry plan, the project administration portal is the hub for seeing and managing users and usage.\nThe member list includes the username, email, status, added date, teams, and role for each user.\nThe admin or owner can revoke access by project, team, or org and change the user role.\nAdditionally, the admin can request login and password history and revoke passwords and active sessions for any user via request to Sentry Support.</p>\n<p>In the audit log, all of the actions by user and event within the Sentry UI (e.g., member.invite, project.create) are listed chronologically by time and IP address so you\u2019ll always have a view into your organization\u2019s most recent history.</p>Secure Application Development (Application Development Lifecycle)<p>Sentry practices continuous delivery, which means all code changes are committed, tested, shipped, and iterated on in a rapid sequence.\nA continuous delivery methodology, complemented by pull request, continuous integration (CI), and automated error tracking, significantly decreases the likelihood of a security issue and improves the response time to and the effective eradication of bugs and vulnerabilities.\nRelease notes and details for Sentry and its SDKs can be found on their respective GitHub release pages (e.g., Sentry releases and raven-js releases).</p>Corporate SecurityMalware Protection<p>At Sentry, we believe that good security practices start with our own team, so we go out of our way to protect against internal threats and local vulnerabilities.\nAll company-provided workstations run Fleetsmith for inventory management, which enables and enforces full-disk encryption, screen lock, and other security features.</p>Risk Management<p>Sentry follows the risk management procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-30, which include nine steps for risk assessment and seven steps for risk mitigation.</p>\n<p>All Sentry product changes must go through code review, CI, and build pipeline to reach production servers.\nOnly designated employees on Sentry\u2019s operations team have secure shell (SSH) access to production servers.</p>\n<p>We perform testing and risk management on all systems and applications on a regular and ongoing basis.\nNew methods are developed, reviewed, and deployed to production via pull request and internal review.\nNew risk management practices are documented and shared via staff presentations on lessons learned and best practices.</p>\n<p>Sentry performs risk assessments throughout the product lifecycle per the standards outlined in HIPAA Security Rule, 45 CFR 164.308:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Before the integration of new system technologies and before changes are made to Sentry physical safeguards</li>\n<li>While making changes to Sentry physical equipment and facilities that introduce new, untested configurations</li>\n<li>Periodically as part of technical and non-technical assessments of the security rule requirements as well as in response to environmental or operational changes affecting security</li>\n</ul>Contingency Planning<p>The Sentry operations team includes service continuity and threat remediation among its top priorities.\nWe keep a contingency plan in case of unforeseen events, including risk management, disaster recovery, and customer communication sub-plans that are tested and updated on an ongoing basis and thoroughly reviewed for gaps and changes at least annually.</p>Security Policies<p>Sentry maintains an internal wiki of security policies, which is updated on an ongoing basis and reviewed annually for gaps.\nAn overview of specific security policies is available to Sentry enterprise customers upon request:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information Security</li>\n<li>Risk Management</li>\n<li>Security Incident Response</li>\n<li>Vulnerability Management</li>\n<li>Policy Management and Maintenance</li>\n<li>Data Request</li>\n<li>Change Management</li>\n<li>System Access</li>\n</ul>Background Checks<p>Sentry conducts background checks for all new hires, including verification on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identity verification</li>\n<li>Global watchlist check</li>\n<li>National criminal records check</li>\n<li>County criminal records check</li>\n<li>(U.S.\nonly) Sex offender registry check</li>\n</ul>Security Training<p>All new employees receive onboarding and systems training, including environment and permissions setup, formal software development training (if pertinent), security policies review, company policies review, and corporate values and ethics training.</p>\n<p>All engineers review security policies as part of onboarding and are encouraged to review and contribute to policies via internal documentation.\nAny change to policy affecting the product is communicated as a pull request, such that all engineers can review and contribute before internal publication.\nMajor updates are communicated via email to all Sentry employees.</p>Disclosure Policy<p>Sentry follows the incident handling and response process recommended by SANS, which includes identifying, containing, eradicating, recovering from, communicating, and documenting security events.\nSentry notifies customers of any data breaches as soon as possible via email and phone call, followed by multiple periodic updates throughout each day addressing progress and impact.\nSentry Enterprise plans include a dedicated customer success manager who holds responsibility for customer communication, as well as regular check-ins and escalations.</p>\n<p>Sentry maintains a live report of operational uptime and issues on our status page.\nAnyone can subscribe to updates via email from the status page.\nAny known incidents are reported there, as well as on our Twitter feed.</p>Vulnerability Disclosure<p>Anyone can report a vulnerability or security concern with a Sentry product by contacting security@sentry.io and including a proof of concept, a list of tools used (including versions), and the output of the tools.\nWe take all disclosures very seriously, and once we receive a disclosure we rapidly verify each vulnerability before taking the necessary steps to fix it.\nOnce verified, we periodically send status updates as problems are fixed.</p>\n<p>To encrypt sensitive information that is sent to us, our PGP key can be found on keyservers with the fingerprint:</p>\n<code>774A FA98 315A 9600 41C7 C17B F08D DBE4 DB76 8FBC\n</code>Other ResourcesCompliance Certifications<p>Sentry has obtained the following compliance certifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SOC2 Type I</li>\n<li>SOC2 Type II</li>\n<li>HIPAA Attestation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Contact us for a copy of any report(s) you\u2019re interested in reading (It\u2019ll be less infuriating than your social feed.)

aware of them.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Access to services<p>Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Sentry grants you a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable right and license to: (i) access and use the Services and its associated documentation, solely for your own internal business purposes, for the Contract Period for which you have paid the applicable Subscription Fees.\nand (ii) access and use any data or reports that we provide or make available to you as part of your access and use of the Services (collectively, \u201c<strong>Reports</strong>\u201d), solely in conjunction with your use of the Services.\nReports are considered part of the applicable Services, for the purpose of the license granted above.\nYou understand that Sentry uses third-party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to provide the Services, and you agree that Sentry is not and will not be liable or responsible for the acts or omissions of such third-party vendors or hosting partners.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Restrictions<p>Except as expressly authorized by these Terms, you may not: (a) modify, disclose, alter, translate or create derivative works of the Site or the Services.\n(b) license, sublicense, resell, distribute, lease, rent, lend, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of the Services or any Report (or any components thereof).\n(c) offer any part of the Services (including, without limitation, any Report) on a timeshare or service bureau basis.\n(c) allow or permit any third party to access or use the Services.\n(d) use the Site or the Services to store or transmit any viruses, software routines, or other code designed to permit

to do any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is against Sentry policy to use our service in support of a business, software, or other material that is dedicated to \u2014 or focused on facilitating or encouraging \u2014 discriminatory, malicious, or harmful speech or actions.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, hate speech and any other material that Sentry reasonably believes degrades, intimidates, or incites violence against people based on gender, race, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, disability, national origin, religion, or other protected categories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Content<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you publish or upload data, images, code or content, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Site or the Services (collectively, \u201c<strong>Content</strong>\u201d), you agree that you are entirely responsible for such Content, and for any harm or liability resulting from or arising out of that Content.\nYour responsibility applies whether or not the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, audio files, video files, computer software, or any other type of content, and whether or not you were the original creator or owner of the Content.\nYou agree that you will be responsible for all Content on your account(s), even if placed there by third parties.\nBy publishing or uploading

available.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Without limiting any of your representations or warranties with respect to the Content, Sentry has the right (but not the obligation) to reject or remove any Content, without liability or notice to you, that Sentry believes, in Sentry\u2019 sole discretion: (i) violates these Terms or any Sentry policy, (ii) violates or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, or (iii) is in any way harmful or objectionable.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Fees and Payment Terms.\nPlan Upgrade/Downgrade/Cancellation.\nPricing Changes<ol>\n<li>\n<p>In exchange for your rights to access the Site and use the Services during the Contract Period, you agree to pay the applicable Subscription Fees to Sentry.\nThe Subscription Fees do not include taxes.\nyou will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes associated with your use of the Site and the Services, other than taxes based on our net income.\nSubscription Fees are payable in full, in advance, in accordance with your Plan, and are non-refundable and non-creditable.\nThis means that: (i) if you have a monthly Contract Period, you will owe us each month\u2019s payment in advance, before you are allowed to use the Services for that month.\n(ii) if you have an annual Contract Period with up-front payment terms, you will owe us the entire year\u2019s payment in advance, before you are allowed to use the Services for that year.\nand (iii) if you have an annual Contract Period with monthly payment terms, you will owe us each month\u2019s payment in advance throughout the Contract Period, before you are allowed to use the Services during each month of the Contract Period.\nYou agree to make all payments in U.S.\nDollars.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>You can cancel your account(s)/subscription(s) via the process set forth in the \u201cCancel Subscription\u201d section of your Account Settings on the Site.\nAn email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation.\nNo refunds will be issued, unless expressly stated otherwise.\nAny cancellation will take effect only at the end of your then-current Contract Period, and you will continue to owe all Subscription Fees for the duration of your then-current Contract Period.\nPro-rata refunds will not be provided.\nYou understand that if you have an annual Contract Period with monthly payment terms: (i) you will still be obligated to pay us the Subscription Fees for the entire annual Contract Period, irrespective of whether you elect to cancel your subscription prior to the end of your then-current Contract Period.\nand (ii) notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right, at our sole and absolute discretion, to permit you to cancel your subscription without further liability by making a lump-sum payment to us that is equal to the upcoming three (3) months of Subscription Fees that you would otherwise have owed us.</strong>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All of your Content will be deleted from the Services within a reasonable time period from when you cancel your account/subscription.\nDeleted Content cannot be recovered once your account/subscription is cancelled.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you upgrade from the free Plan to any paid Plan, we will immediately bill you for the applicable Subscription Fees.\nThere will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Downgrading your account(s) may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your account(s).\nWe do not accept any liability for such loss.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Each Contract Period will automatically renew (and we may automatically invoice you) for additional Contract Periods of equivalent length, unless and until one party provides written notice to the other at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Contract Period that it wishes to terminate the subscription at the end of the then-current Contract Period.\nWe reserve the right to modify the fees for the Services at any time upon thirty (30) days\u2019 prior notice to you, provided that the modified fees will not apply until the next Contract Period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interest on any late payments will accrue at the rate of 1.5% per month, or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date the amount is due until the date the amount is paid in full.\nIf you are late in paying us, you also agree that, in addition to our rights to suspend your access to the Services, terminate your account(s), downgrade you to a free Plan, and/or pursue any other rights or remedies available to us at law or in equity, you are responsible to reimburse us for any costs that we incur while attempting to collect such late payments.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Overage Events<p>The Subscription Fees you owe for the Plan you select are based on the number of errors and similar events (each, an \u201c<strong>Event</strong>\u201d) that you are permitted to send to us each month.\nIf you exceed the Event limit for your Plan in a given month, you will owe us additional, on-demand fees for each additional Event (collectively, \u201c<strong>Overage Events</strong>\u201d).\nTo avoid paying additional on-demand fees for your Overage Events, we encourage customers to use their account\u2019s administrative console to restrict the number of Events that they are permitted to send to us in a given month (a

Sentry\noperations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an\nas-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.\nSpecific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored\nin a secure and encrypted location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Penetration Testing</strong>.\nWe engage an independent, third-party agency to perform\nblack box penetration testing on an annual basis.\nInformation about security\nvulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration testing is\nthen used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.\nIf you are a customer on\none of our \u201cEnterprise\u201d plans, we will provide a summary of penetration test\nfindings to you upon request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Intrusion Detection and Prevention</strong>.\nUnusual network patterns or suspicious\nbehavior are among Sentry\u2019s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and\nmanagement.\nGoogle Cloud Platform\u2019s intrusion detection and prevention systems\n(IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help\nidentify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.\nIDS/IPS\ninvolves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface,\nemploying intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing\nand deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as\nwell as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.\nWe do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide\naccess to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any\nunscheduled downtime.</p>\n<p>For more information, please review our Security &amp.\nCompliance Policy.</p>Do we use

retention periods.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Is there an automated control, such as in your privacy dashboard, that\nenables you to access and delete the personal data at any time?</em> If there is\nnot, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</em> If so, a shortened retention time\nwould generally be appropriate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</em> If so, we will\nretain the data in accordance with your consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<em>Is
