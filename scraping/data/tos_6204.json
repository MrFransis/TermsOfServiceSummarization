aforementioned recordings being made and to the processing, publication and use thereof, in the broadest sense, without the Organiser or any of its affiliated companies being liable to pay any compensation to him at any time.\n</p>\n<p>14.2 The Visitor hereby irrevocably renounces any interest that he could have in the aforementioned recordings.\nInsofar as the Visitor has any copyright,

cannot warrant that the Event will be entirely smokefree.\nThe Visitor will not be entitled under any circumstances to a refund of the amount of the Ticket or to any other compensation if the Event is not entirely smokefree.\n</p>\n<p>15.2 If a ban or command on smoking is breached, the security staff can to the extent possible immediately remove the Visitor insofar as possible and any fines

the General Terms and Conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nArticle 17 Electronic Payment Instrument\n<p>During the Event, the Organiser can, make use of an \u2018open loop\u2019 and/or

on a payment card specifically created for that Event.</p>\n<p>During the Event no refund to the Visitor (\u201cRefund\u201d) of the value of any remaining credit on this payment card (\u201cRemaining credit\u201d) will take place.\nThe Remaining credit can be Refunded only once to the Visitor after the Event.\nThe Visitor needs to request the Organiser for a Refund of the Remaining credit within two weeks after the Event, unless stated otherwise.\nAfter this period the Visitor loses the right to a Refund of the Remaining credit.\nAll necessary information regarding (the application of) the Refund, can be read on the Event Website.\nPerforming a Refund entails costs and the Organiser reserves the right to impose these costs on the Visitor.\nThese costs are expressed on the Event Website.\nThe payment card should remain after the Event in the possession of the Visitor since with this payment card the Remaining credit will be determined.\nIn case of loss or possible theft of the payment card a Refund of any Remaining credit is not possible.\nThe Organiser is never liable for any loss and/or theft of the payment card.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\nArticle 18 Lockers\n<p>The

additional general terms (of a third party) may apply, to which general terms the Visitor agrees at the time of renting the locker.\nThe Organiser will not be liable for loss and/or theft and/or use by another of the personal code.\nTherefore, the Visitor should always keep the code for himself and the Visitor is recommended to not store any valuables in the

\u201cWebsite\u201d).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nDefinitions</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this Privacy and cookie statement, the following terms or definitions are used:</p>\n<p>Account: your personal registration via an Opt-in on websites or apps with which you access the Service.\nDevices: the devices, such as PCs, smartphones or tablets, with which access can be obtained to the Service.\nContent: information (including audio-visual material such as trailers and previews) that ID&amp;T makes available as part of the Service.\nService: the complete package of services that ID&amp;T offers to you.\nFor example, websites and apps, the Account, but also the events and the services provided at events.\nFor example, the option of paying at an event for refreshments using an

name, e-mail address or an IP address.\nAdvertising Network: An RTB/Programmatic Network (also called Real Time Bidding Network) offers advertisers the opportunity to purchase advertising space through an auction.\nTo optimise advertising, advertisers and RTB networks place cookies.\nBy means of these cookies, you are tracked and targeted to visit other sites that are connected to the same network.\n</p>\n<p>Privacy and cookie statement: this privacy and cookie statement of ID&amp;T.\nID&amp;T: The private company with limited liability ID&amp;T Enterprise B.V., Overhoeksplein 31, 1031 KS, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is the data controller for the Processing of your Personal Data.\nProcessing for the benefit of ID&amp;T companies affiliated to ID&amp;T and/or ID&amp;T events also fall under ID&amp;T.\nProcessing (Process, Processed): All use of your Personal Data such as storing, modifying, forwarding or (partially) deleting these data.\nFor example, ID&amp;T processes Personal Data because you use ID&amp;T websites or apps.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nPersons younger than 16 years</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Persons who have not yet reached the age of 16 (minors) may only register for an ID&amp;T Account with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.\nThe parent(s) or legal representative of the minor user must read this Privacy and cookie statement in the interests of the minor user and can exercise the rights of the user in question instead of the minor user.</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T advises parents or legal guardians to supervise the use that a minor user makes of the Service and to make such users aware of how their Personal Data can be used on the basis of this Privacy and cookie statement.\nID&amp;T makes reasonable efforts, with due observance of technology, to check that only users aged 16 or older can create an ID&amp;T Account.\nID&amp;T does this for example by means of a birth date check when a profile is created.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhich of your Personal Data are Processed by ID&amp;T?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T Processes the following of your Personal Data for the purposes explained later in this Privacy and cookie statement:</p>\n<p>\u2022 First Name.\n\u2022 Surname.\n\u2022 Email address.\n\u2022 Sex.\n\u2022 Date of birth.\n\u2022 Address.\n\u2022 Residence.\n\u2022 Telephone number.\n\u2022 Country.\nand\n\u2022 Preferences such as artist preference, event visit, music preference, clothing preference, clothing size and possibly geo-location only after explicit permission in an Optin of ID&amp;T.</p>\n<p>It is not the case that ID&amp;T always uses all of your above-mentioned data.\nThis depends on purposes as described later in this Privacy and cookie statement.</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T has deliberately chosen not to use special Personal Data such as race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious convictions, union membership, orientation, health or criminal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nHow does ID&amp;T obtain your Personal Data?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T obtains your Personal Data in the following ways:</p>\n<p>Directly from you:\nFor example, if you sign up for a special campaign, ticket or promotion run by ID&amp;T, if you send an e-mail or otherwise contact ID&amp;T (for example with questions about the use of the Services).</p>\n<p>As a result of using the Service:\nBy means of your registration, you have access to the Service.\nIn addition, ID&amp;T can also offer the Service to persons without a registration.\nIf you give permission for this, ID&amp;T can read and store the unique characteristics of the device that has been used in the context of the Service.\nBased on the ID&amp;T Account and/or the unique features of the Device which you use to access the Service, ID&amp;T can keep track of your use of the Service, including the Content that is watched, read, listened, commented or shared using the ID&amp;T Account.\nInsofar as mobile Devices are used, the location of the Device is passed on to ID&amp;T in the context of the Service.\nPrior to installation of such apps on a mobile device, you are explicitly requested to allow your location data to be determined and used.\n</p>\n<p>From third parties:\nFor example, if you or another visitor of an ID&amp;T website or app uses social network functions that are integrated in the Service, ID&amp;T may receive certain information from the relevant social network, such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+.\nID&amp;T may also receive information from partners who are involved with the Service.\nFor example, ID&amp;T uses services provided by other parties that help it to map and analyse the way in which the Content and websites are used.\nAn example of this is Google Analytics.\nThis tool enables ID&amp;T to monitor websites (where do you click and how often).\nOther examples are partners who on your behalf handle payment for the Service.\nExamples are iDeal, PayPal or Adyen, which handle the payment transactions between you and the services/products provided by ID&amp;T.</p>\n<p>At events: ID&amp;T can also process visitor data at the events that it organizes, such as registering an event for commercial or security purposes (with camera).\nWhen entering an event location, the visitor is always informed of such processing.\n</p>\n<p>You can withdraw your permission for use of personal data at any time by sending a message to: GDPR@id-t.com</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the reason why ID&amp;T Processes your Personal Information?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>ID&amp;T processes your Personal Data for the following purposes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>a.\nIn order to provide the Service:\nExample.\ndata that is entered when registering for a ticket or using a service (such as name and date of birth) can be used to check whether you meet the set requirements (e.g.\nto monitor age).\nSpecified contact details can be used to inform you about (changes to) the Service or planned maintenance (service e-mails).\n</p>\n<p>b.\nIn order to process payments:\nCertain data that are requested when registering or using it, may be required for issuing invoices and processing payment for a Service.</p>\n<p>c: In order to build a profile ID&amp;T strives to ensure that the Service is as relevant as possible for you.\nTo do this, ID&amp;T keeps a profile based on your use of the Service to get an idea of your most likely interests.\nID&amp;T does this for example, by keeping track of what Content you request or which purchases (such as tickets, refreshments, merchandise or travel package) you make.\nAnother way in which ID&amp;T builds a profile is by using your location data at events (after gaining explicit permission to do so) to see which artists, music and experiences appeal to you.\nBased on these interests, ID&amp;T can then change the Content, including adverts, that appear on ID&amp;T touchpoints.\nAs an example, ID&amp;T can then show recommendations for similar Content that has certain artists or events.\n</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T can also use these profiles for campaigns run by online advertisers.\nID&amp;T is and will remain the owner of these profiles and will never make these profiles available to third parties.\nID&amp;T only shares the segments (tags) with the advertisers (e.g.\n\u2018woman, age category 20 to 30 years), to ensure that the adverts match the interests.\n</p>\n<p>d.\nIn order to send newsletters and promotions:\nID&amp;T can also use contact information and other data that have been collected to keep you informed by phone, mail, e-mail, SMS, push messages from apps or other suitable media, about promotions or offers from ourselves (action e-mails), or to keep you informed about the Service and the Content (newsletter e-mails).\nYou can unsubscribe from this at any time.\n</p>\n<p>e.\nIn order to improve the Service and to identify general trends:\nID&amp;T uses your usage data to analyse in a general sense how the Service is used and which trends can be observed, in order to make more informed decisions about, for example, further development of the Service and the Content offering.\nIt is also possible to track purely technical trends for that purpose, for example which types of Devices or browsers are used to retrieve the Content.</p>\n<p>f.\nIn order to prevent misuse:\nID&amp;T also Processes your Personal Data and your use of the Service in order to prevent misuse of the Service and the Content, to prevent fraud (e.g.\nwith credit card or other means of payment), and to protect the rights of others (including the right-holders to the Content).</p>\n<p>g.\nIn order to carry out market research:\nID&amp;T can contact you and former users and visitors of the Service that have provided their contact details for the purposes of market research.\nParticipation in such research is always on a voluntary basis.\nID&amp;T can, based on this research, send offers to you and others who participated in this research, provided that prior permission has been given for this.</p>\n<p>h.\nIn order to ensure compliance with laws and regulations:\nYour Personal Data can be used to comply with laws and regulations that apply to ID&amp;T, to deal with disputes and to have audits carried out.</p>\n<p>i.\nID&amp;T can utilize profiling.\nWhich means collecting, analysing and combining of (personal) data aiming to tag you in a specific (interest) category.\n(race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious believes, trade union membership, orientation, health or criminal data) are consciously excluded within GDPR</p>\n<p>The importance of profiling is that we can gain interests which content you may be interested in and which products or services (including commercial products or services) would suit you.\nProfiling ensures that both the content and ads are more in line with your personal interests.</p>\n<p>Profiling can impact your privacy.\nFor example, if false (interest) categories are linked to you based on incorrect or outdated data.\nIf you believe that this is the case, the GDPR provides you the right to have your data modified or removed.\nIn this case, please contact ID&amp;T.\nFor more information on the Right of correction, postage and removal visit www.id-t.com/myprivacy</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nWhy does ID&amp;T Process your Personal Data?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The main reason why ID&amp;T Processes your Personal Data is because this is necessary to provide its Service.\nFor example, ID&amp;T Processes your Personal Data so that it can grant you access to its websites, apps or events.\nIt may also be the case that ID&amp;T Processes your Personal Data because it is obliged to do so because of laws and regulations.\nFor example, the Dutch General Act on Government Tax makes it mandatory to retain payment data for 7 years for the Tax Authorities.</p>\n<p>Another reason why ID&amp;T Processes Personal Data is because either ID&amp;T or a third party has a legitimate reason for doing this, such as a commercial interest.\nIn that case, ID&amp;T will always make a thorough assessment as to whether this interest is greater than your privacy interest.</p>\n<p>Finally, ID&amp;T can Process Personal Data on the basis of your permission.\nFor example, ID&amp;T asks for your permission before placing and reading tracking cookies or before sending you (electronic) commercial messages.\nYou can withdraw your permission for use of personal data at any time by sending a message to: GDPR@id-t.com</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nWho does ID&amp;T share your Personal Data with?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Within the ID&amp;T group:\nThe Personal Data that are collected are Processed by ID&amp;T also for the companies affiliated with ID&amp;T.\nThese companies can access your Personal Data insofar as this fits within the purposes described in this Privacy and cookie statement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With (other) suppliers of ID&amp;T:</strong>\nID&amp;T can share your Personal Data with the suppliers it works with to realise the Service (for example a mailing company, call centre, collection agency, market research agency, event partners or the party that has been commissioned by ID&amp;T for the technical realisation of a website or app).\nWhere possible, ID&amp;T places these third parties under the obligation to act in the capacity of data processor.\nThis means that ID&amp;T determines the purpose for which and the manner in which the personal data are to be Processed and the data processor is only allowed to handle your data according to the instructions and (security) standards of ID&amp;T.\nThese agreements determined by ID&amp;T with each data processor are set out in a so-called processor agreement.\nIf these third parties are outside the European Economic Area (EEA), ID&amp;T has reached (additional) agreements with these parties.\nID&amp;T signs a model contract with these data processors that has been approved by the European Commission (also called standard contractual clauses).\nWhere data are transferred to the United States, ID&amp;T either agrees on the model contract or ID&amp;T allows the transfer under the EU-US Privacy Shield.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With other ID&amp;T partners:</strong>\nIn specific cases, in the context of the purposes described above, it is necessary to share Personal Data with third parties who use this Personal Data independently.\nIn addition, ID&amp;T can provide Personal Data for marketing purposes to other partners selected by ID&amp;T.\nID&amp;T will first request separate permission from you to do this.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>With the authorities and others:</strong>\nIn exceptional cases, ID&amp;T may provide Personal Data to authorities or third parties, if ID&amp;T is required to do so by law or by order of the court, or if there is reasonable reason to believe that this is necessary in order to prevent damage or misuse.\n</p>\n<p>You can withdraw your permission for use of your personal data at any time by sending a message to: GDPR@id-t.com</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nCookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Cookies are small files that can be placed on your Devices by the websites or apps of ID&amp;T.\nFor example, you can easily be recognised during a subsequent visit without having to log in again on your ID&amp;T Account.\nLikewise, information relating to website use can be collected using cookies about other visitors of the ID&amp;T websites (who are not logged in with an ID&amp;T Account).\nThere are different types of cookies.\nIn some cases, cookies are automatically deleted when you close your browser.\nin other cases, these cookies are stored for longer and can be read the next time you use the Service.\nWhere ID&amp;T collects Personal Data using cookies, these Personal Data are Processed in accordance with the provisions set out in this Privacy and cookie statement.\nBefore ID&amp;T places non-functional cookies, ID&amp;T will inform you about this and ask for your permission.\nIt is only after permission has been given that these cookies are placed and read.\n</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T itself places cookies in order to identify you on your next visit without the need for you to log in again with your ID&amp;T Account.\nID&amp;T can also place cookies for the purpose of creating profiles.\nID&amp;T can also place tracking cookies, which are used by ID&amp;T if you as a visitor navigate to third party websites where ID&amp;T can place ads via an RTB and/or Programmatic network (see: 1 - Definitions).\nAdditionally, ID&amp;T uses third parties to analyse the use of its Content, websites, apps and the Service.\nThese third parties also place cookies for ID&amp;T on your Devices, which are used to map your use of the Service.\nFor example, Google Analytics.\n</p>\n<p>Cookies from third parties are placed on your Devices by third parties, and only these third parties have access to those cookies and the information collected by the cookie.\nThird parties that have permission to place cookies via the Service are, for example, advertising networks that place the adverts on the ID&amp;T websites.\nAd networks usually leave so-called \"tracking cookies\" on your devices.\nTracking cookies enable advertisers to track your browsing habits so that they can display as many relevant ads as possible on the websites that you visit.\nSocial networking services such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+ can also place cookies via the websites of ID&amp;T.\nThis is done via the buttons of these social networks that may appear on the websites of ID&amp;T to promote (\"Like\") or share (\"tweet\u201d) Content.</p>\n<p>Below is an overview of (technical) partners on the

longer received the next time you use the Service.\nThis differs from browser to browser.\nwe recommend that you consult the help function of the browser if necessary.\nThis should also explain how to delete cookies that have been previously placed.\n</p>\n<p>NB: A visitor to the website or a user who no longer wishes to receive cookies should change these settings in all browsers and on all

ID&amp;T store your Personal Data?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T will keep your Personal Data for as long as necessary to get you the best service or in case of refund terms, warranty or recurring contact needed to keep you up to date.\nID&amp;T stores your data for at least as long as you use the Service and if your account is inactive, for a period of 2 years thereafter.\nThe reason for ID&amp;T doing this is so that you can easily return to using the Service when re-activating.\nIf you have been inactive for a long period (longer than 2 years), ID&amp;T will delete your data.</p>\n<p>An exception to this is if the law prescribes that ID&amp;T must retain certain data for a longer period of time.\nFor example, the Dutch General Act on Government Tax makes it mandatory to retain payment data for 7 years for the Tax Authorities.</p>\n<p>__10.\nHow does ID&amp;T protect your Personal Data? __ </p>\n<p>ID&amp;T at all times maintains a level of security in the Processing of Personal Information that, in view of the state of the art, is sufficient to prevent the loss, alteration, disclosure of or unauthorised access to Personal Data.\nIf ID&amp;T engages third parties, then ID&amp;T imposes the same level of security on them.\nID&amp;T has a close relation to its data processors and made clear agreements in our Processor Agreements</p>\n<p>Questions about this security can be directed to GDPR@ID-T.com</p>\n<p>__11.\nWhat are your rights? __</p>\n<p>People whose Personal Data are Processed have certain rights under the law.\nYou can at all times

Protection Authority.\n</p>\n<p>ID&amp;T tries to ensure that you can exercise these rights as much as possible yourself.\nFor example, you can exercise your rights by viewing, correcting or deleting your data in the ID&amp;T Account.\nYou can also exercise these rights by contacting us via the e-mail address Myprivacy@ID-T.com ID&amp;T will try to respond to your request within 4 weeks.\n(read
