carefully.</p>\n10.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration\nSummary\n<p>A third party arbitrator will help us resolve any disputes we might have.\nThis means that any dispute will be resolved outside of class-action litigation.\nHopefully, disputes will never be an issue, but you should read this section carefully for details on how it works.</p>\n10.1 Generally\n<p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Credit Karma in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Credit Karma agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with the Agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nYou and us further agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.\nthe arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n&nbsp;All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of the Agreement.\nThe arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE AGREEMENT AND AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU AND CREDIT KARMA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\nYOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE EXPRESSLY AND KNOWINGLY WAIVED THESE RIGHTS.</strong>\n</p>\n10.2 Exceptions\n<p>Despite the provisions of Section 10.1, you and us both agree that nothing in the Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either of us to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court within its jurisdictional limits under Consumer Arbitration Rule 9(b), even after filing an arbitration.\n(b) file a complaint with the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available.\n(c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of a pending arbitration.\nor (d) to file a suit in a court of law solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of our Services or address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>\n10.3 Arbitrator\n<p>Any arbitration between you and Credit Karma will be conducted under the Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201c) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201c), as modified by the Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Credit Karma here.</p>\n10.4 Notice and Process\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other by certified mail (\u201c<strong>Notice</strong>\u201c).\nCredit Karma\u2019s address for Notice is: Credit Karma, LLC, P.O.\nBox 30963, Oakland, CA 94604, Attention: Legal Department.\nThe Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201c).\nYou and Credit Karma agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if you and Credit Karma do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Credit Karma must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nThe arbitration proceedings, including any exchanged materials, shall be confidential and you and Credit Karma agree to use reasonable efforts to streamline the proceedings, including discovery, consistent with the objectives of efficient dispute resolution.</p>\n10.5 Fees\n<p>If you commence arbitration in accordance with the Agreement, Credit Karma will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules.\nAny arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, or as otherwise required, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nor (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your registered account address.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.&nbsp.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse Credit Karma for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nLikewise, Credit Karma will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees or costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims or defenses are frivolous.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n&nbsp;The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgement on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>\n10.6 No Class Actions\n<p>\n<strong>YOU AND CREDIT KARMA AGREE THAT EACH MUST BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Further, unless both you and Credit Karma agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n10.7 Modifications\n<p>If Credit Karma makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Credit Karma\u2019s address for Notice), you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Credit Karma\u2019s address for Notice, in which case your account with Credit Karma will be immediately terminated but this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive.</p>\n10.8 Enforceability\n<p>If any provision of this Section 10 is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p>Return to the table of contents</p>\n11.\nDeactivation and Termination\n11.1 Termination of Agreement.\nSurviving Terms.\n<p>The Agreement is effective until your member account, if applicable, is deactivated by either you or Credit Karma and you discontinue all use of our Services.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, any section of the Agreement that by its nature is intended to survive termination of the Agreement or your use or access to our Services or our Content will survive such termination.</p>\nSummary\n<p>The Agreement lasts until your account is deactivated and you completely stop using our services (but there are a few parts that have to live on forever).</p>\n11.2 Deactivating Your Member Account\n<p>If you decide you want to deactivate your account you can do so by visiting our help page.</p>\n<p>Return to the table of contents</p>\n12.\nMiscellaneous\nSummary\n<p>This entire section is where you\u2019ll find a bunch of standard legalese.\nEach one is pretty quick, so we won\u2019t break them down any further.</p>\n12.1 Governing Law\n<p>The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding conflicts of law provisions.</p>\n12.2 Entire Agreement\n<p>The terms of the Agreement

your rights or obligations, you may need to accept the modified terms to continue to use our Services.\nMaterial modifications will take effect when you accept the modified terms.\nimmaterial modifications will take effect when published.\nBy continuing to use our Services following any modification to these terms, our Privacy Statement or any Additional Terms, you are agreeing to the Agreement as modified.</p>\n12.4 Waiver Only in Writing\n<p>Credit Karma\u2019s failure to enforce any of its rights or act with respect to a breach by you or others of the Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any rights and will not limit Credit Karma\u2019s rights with respect to that breach or any subsequent breaches.\nNo waiver by Credit Karma of any of the provisions in the Agreement will be of any force or effect unless made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Credit Karma.</p>\n12.5 Assignment\n<p>Credit Karma may assign the Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.\nYou may not assign your rights under the Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our consent.</p>\n12.6 Severability\n<p>If any provision of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for any reason, then that provision will be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\n<strong>Nothing in the Agreement shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights or remedies that apply to you.</strong>\n</p>\n12.7 Interpretation\n<p>The titles and annotations, including the \u201cSummary\u201d sections, contained in these terms are inserted only as a matter of convenience and have no legal or contractual effect.\nThe Agreement will not be construed against Credit Karma because we drafted it.</p>\n<p>Whew!

tools and services that are designed to help you make financial progress.\nBefore you get started, we\u2019d like to tell you more about what we do with information we collect about you.</p>\n<p>When you use, access or interact with our Services (which we define for you in Section 1 of our Terms of Service,&nbsp;accessible here), you are agreeing to our Terms of Service and consenting to how we collect, share and otherwise use information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.\nSince we do collect information about you, you should also know we\u2019re committed to securing our systems and the protection of your data.\nYou can find more details on our&nbsp;Security Practices&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>In other words, as legalese-y as they are, please read these documents carefully.</p>\nWhat This Policy Covers\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers how Credit Karma, Inc.\nand its affiliated companies (collectively, \u201cCredit Karma,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cour\u201d) collect, use, and share information in connection with your access and use of our Services.\nIt does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control.</p>\n<p>That said, you should know that we may provide third party content or links to third-party web sites or applications, or include features that allow you to connect your Credit Karma account with your accounts with third parties, such as financial institutions or social media platforms like Facebook.\nWhen you leave our Services or interact with a third-party feature, you should also read the applicable third party\u2019s privacy policies and terms of service to make sure you understand how they might collect and share information about you (everybody is different).</p>\nWhat Information We Collect\n<p>To put it simply, there are three main ways we collect information about you: when you give it to us, with automatic technologies and when we ask others for it.\nAllow us to explain.</p>\nInformation You Provide to Us\n<p>You may provide information to us in various ways, such as through forms, features or other means offered through our Services.\nA couple of examples include information you provide to us when registering as a member, and feedback forms where you send us comments, questions, or other feedback.\nThe types of information you provide us fits into two general categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Information</strong>: This is information that identifies you personally, such as your full name, street address, email address, Social Security number or phone number.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: This is information about you or your household that doesn\u2019t identify you personally, like your gender, income or what types of financial products you\u2019re interested in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we combine information that isn\u2019t Personal Information (like Non-Personal Information or Usage Information, which we explain below) with Personal Information, we treat it like Personal Information for as long as it is combined.</p>\nInformation We Automatically Collect\n<p>In addition to information you provide to us, we automatically collect certain information about how you access and interact with our Services (\u201cUsage Information\u201d).\nThis Usage Information is a key part of how we improve your Credit Karma experience and provide you with more personalized insights and recommendations.\nWe and our partners may use various technologies to collect and store Usage Information in connection with our Services.\nThese may include things like cookies, browser web storage (e.g., HTML5), web beacons and similar technologies.\nThere are three types of Usage Information we may collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Device Information</strong>.\nThis is information about how you access our Services, such as the operating system, hardware model, application or browser type and version, and unique identifiers associated with your device.\nWe may also integrate with built-in device features (e.g., when you turn on fingerprint access for your Credit Karma account).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Log Information</strong>.\nThere are certain pieces of information we automatically collect in system logs or similar files about how you interact with our Services, such as which features you visit or click on.\nThis Log Information may also include things like your IP address, browser or device configuration, date and time of access and cookie information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Information</strong>.\nWe may use certain information like your IP address or other Device Information or Log Information to estimate your location (e.g., your city or state).\nWe may also request to use location-enabled services on your device (which typically provide GPS or Wi-Fi access point details) to enhance our Services.\nWe will only use these location-enabled services on your device with your consent, though.</li>\n</ul>\nInformation Third Parties Provide About You\n<p>Many of our features rely on information about you that we collect from third parties, such as the free credit reports and credit scores we request on your behalf from TransUnion and Equifax.\nWe may also work with different third party partners to supplement the Usage Information and other information we collect directly from you.\nFor example, our partners may provide us with information such as employment or income data, vehicle or driver information, or information about special offers available based on your credit profile so that we can give you more personalized recommendations.\nWe might also collect information from other users like you through things like a member referral program.</p>\nHow We Use the Information We Collect\n<p>We use the information we collect from you and third parties to operate our Services, communicate with you, conduct research and development to improve or enhance our Services and our users\u2019 experience, and promote our Services.\nThese are a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To create your account and provide the Services to you</strong>.\nWe use the information we collect to create and secure your account, create and maintain your Member Profile, and to provide the Services to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To provide features to you, such as your free credit reports and scores</strong>.\nWe use the information we collect to provide you with free credit reports and scores from our credit bureau partners.\nCredit Karma offers much more than free credit reports and scores though.\nthe information we collect also goes into developing and bringing you various other features like free credit monitoring, ID monitoring, tracking your spending, and personalized offer recommendations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To improve our recommendations and insights</strong>.\nThe information we collect also helps us tailor our content and improve the way we match you to recommended offers or insights.\nWe\u2019re constantly working on ways to better identify and present the information that\u2019s most relevant to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To communicate with you</strong>.\nWe use information we collect to provide you with member support or to send you things like service-related announcements, credit or ID monitoring alerts, recommendations, offers from our partners and other updates or promotions.\nMost of the time we\u2019ll communicate with you by email, but we may also send you push notifications, browser notifications, or even snail mail.\nFor information on how to adjust your communications preferences, check out the \u201cCommunications Preferences\u201d section of this policy, below.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To conduct research and to improve and promote our services</strong>.\nWe use the information we collect to conduct research and to improve or enhance and promote our Services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For legal reasons</strong>.\nWe reserve the right to access, use, preserve, transfer or disclose, at any time without notice to you, any information (including Personal Information) as reasonably necessary to:\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with any applicable law, regulation, subpoena or legal process, or respond to any governmental requests and cooperate with law enforcement, if we believe such action is required or permitted by law;</li>\n<li>Enforce our&nbsp;Terms of Service, including investigating any potential violations;</li>\n<li>Protect the safety, integrity, rights or security of our members, our Services or equipment, or any third party.\nor</li>\n<li>Detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues related to our Services or our partners.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\nWhen We Share the Information We Collect\n<p>First, we want to be clear about how we do not share information about you (what we call the \u201cNo-Nos\u201d):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;share your credit reports or scores with unaffiliated third parties (except agents acting on our behalf.\nwe explain that below).</li>\n<li>We do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;sell your Personal Information to or share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their own advertising or marketing purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the No-Nos, let us explain how we could share with third parties.\nWe may share information about you, including Personal Information, with third parties in a variety of ways, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Agents acting on our behalf</strong>.\nWe may share information about you with service providers or agents in order to have them perform on our behalf any of the activities we are permitted to conduct under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.\nThis includes things like designing or operating features, helping us research and test feature improvements, identifying offers or personalized recommendations, performing analytics and marketing our Services.\nThese third parties are acting on our behalf so while they may have access to your information, including things like your credit reports and scores, they\u2019re required to follow our instructions and meet the standards explained in our Privacy Policy when handling information about you that we provide them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When we collaborate with third parties to provide and improve our Services</strong>.\nWe may sometimes share information about you with third parties we collaborate with in connection with providing or improving our Services.\nThis can occur, for example, when we\u2019re providing an integrated or co-branded feature with a partner (e.g., our Credit Score Simulator) or doing a joint research project with another organization to help improve our Services.\nWe may also share information like the feedback you submit to us if it relates to both our Services and a partner\u2019s products.\nWhen we share information with third-party collaborators, our collaborators are obligated to follow the No-Nos above, but may also use the information in connection with their own activities to the extent allowed under their own privacy practices (e.g., respond to your feedback, conduct additional research, or improve a feature of theirs).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Our partners when you ask for their services</strong>.\nWe may also give you opportunities to interact with third party partners through our Services, such as when we provide you with the opportunity to review and send your personal information to a partner in order to pre-populate your application on the partner\u2019s site or we send you to the partner\u2019s site for you to provide the information directly to them.\nIn some cases, if you click through to go to a partner\u2019s site, you will automatically be sending your personal information to that partner.\nWhen this happens, you will still have to submit your application on the partner\u2019s site.\nRemember that any information you provide to the partner, whether through us or on your own, will be subject to their privacy practices and terms and conditions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>When you publicly post the information</strong>.\nAs part of our Services, we may provide opportunities for you to publicly post reviews, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, which may include Personal Information and portions of your Member Profile designated as public profile information, like your name or user name.\nAnything you share in a public forum is, obviously, public, so think carefully about what you decide to share.\nYou should also read our&nbsp;Community Rules&nbsp;for more information on what is appropriate to post.\nIf you would like us to remove Personal Information included in Community Content, contact us&nbsp;here.\nIn some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, but we will try to respond to let you know why.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>As Part of a Corporate Change</strong>.\nWe may disclose and transfer information about you to a third party as part of, or in preparation for, a change of control, restructuring, corporate change, or sale or transfer of assets.\nIf such a business transfer results in a material change in the treatment of your Personal Information, you will be notified by e-mail (using the primary email address on your account) or by a prominent notice on our site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Legal Reasons</strong>.\nWe reserve the right to transfer or disclose information about you to third parties for certain legal purposes.\n(You can read more about these in the \u201cHow We Use the Information We Collect\u201d section above.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With Your Consent</strong>.\nThere may also be other limited contexts in which we share specific types of personal information with your express consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share with third parties de-identified or aggregated data we collect, such as de-identified or aggregated credit reports or scores, de-identified demographic information, or information about the computer or device from which you access the Service.\nWe share such information for a variety of purposes, including to analyze Service usage, develop shared services, and improve our own products and features.</p>\nHow to Access, Update or Deactivate Your Account\nAccessing and Updating Your Account Information\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you provide to us, such as your Member Profile information.\nYou can access and make changes to certain Personal Information by logging in to your account through our website and updating your \u201cPersonal Information\u201d page.</p>\nCommunications Preferences\n<p>You can manage your communications preferences by visiting&nbsp;your account profile.\nFor example, you can choose which types of monitoring alerts you want to receive.\nWe\u2019ll also include \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions in marketing emails.\nYou may also have the ability to adjust app- or browser-specific communications settings (e.g., for things like push or browser notifications) within the settings screen of your mobile app or browser.\nTechnology moves fast, so the types of communications and communication preference options might change from time to time.</p>\nCanceling Your Membership and Deactivating Your Account\n<p>We hope this never happens, but if you decide you no longer want to use our Services, you can cancel and deactivate your account on our&nbsp;help page.</p>\n<p>One more thing to note: Due to our recordkeeping and information retention requirements, we do not delete information about you upon deactivation.\nWe will, however, disable your account and stop sending you further communications.\nFurthermore, except to the extent necessary for legal or regulatory recordkeeping purposes, we anonymize the data in your Member Profile two years after you deactivate your account.\nIt may take a little more time for our automated backup systems to fully process the anonymized account, though.</p>\nOur Interest-Based Advertisement Practices\nAdvertising Service Providers\n<p>Some of our third-party service providers or partners are advertising networks, marketing partners, publishers and other entities who perform analytics and advertise our products and services on websites not affiliated with us (\u201cAdvertising Service Providers\u201d).\nIn connection with these advertising services, we or our Advertising Service Providers, like Google Analytics (more on this below) may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect behavioral information about how you use our site or other websites in order to perform tracking and marketing analytics or serve advertisements that are more likely to be of interest to you (\u201cInterest-Based Advertisements\u201d).\nOur Advertising Service Providers may permit you to opt out of all or some Interest-Based Advertisements on designated websites.\nFor example, many of our Advertising Service Providers participate in the&nbsp;Network Advertising Initiative&nbsp;opt-out program or the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out program.</p>\nDisclosure Regarding Google Analytics Advertising Features\n<p>In addition to services from other Advertising Service Providers, we use the following Google Analytics Advertising Features as part of our marketing analytics and advertising: Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, DoubleClick Platform integrations and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.\nWe may also use other services provided by Google Analytics from time to time.\nAt present, Google provides users an opportunity to opt-out of the Google Analytics Features through Google\u2019s Ads Settings and their&nbsp;web browser opt-out plugin.\nHowever, we do not control these opt outs, which may be updated or removed by Google in accordance with its own policies.\nFor additional information on opting out of interest-based ads by Google, you can visit Google\u2019s Opt out page&nbsp;here.</p>\nDo Not Track Signals\n<p>At this time, we do not respond to automated signals regarding tracking mechanisms, including \u201cdo not track\u201d instructions from your browser.\nPlease note that blocking cookies may affect your browsing experience on many sites and may limit your ability to use certain features of our Services, including many of the personalized features we provide for our members.</p>\nOur Security Practices and Social Security Protection Policy Statement\n<p>Credit Karma maintains physical, electronic, administrative and procedural safeguards intended to protect the confidentiality of Personal Information that we collect about you, including Social Security numbers.\nWe limit access to Social Security numbers to help protect against their loss or misuse and we do not disclose Social Security numbers to third parties except with your consent, or where such disclosure is required or permitted by law.\nRead more about&nbsp;our Security Practices.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can contact us&nbsp;here.</p>\nChanges to Our Privacy Policy\n<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you.\nIf there are any material changes in the way we treat your credit report information or Personal Information, Credit Karma will send a notice to the primary email address on your account or place a prominent notice on our platform before the change goes into effect.\nCredit Karma will also promptly make an updated Privacy Policy publicly available on our platform.\nChanges will be effective as soon as the revised Privacy Policy is posted unless otherwise stated.</p>\nWant More Information?\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read through all this.\nIf you have questions regarding this policy or privacy practices at Credit Karma, you can contact our legal department&nbsp;here&nbsp;or write to us at: Credit Karma, Inc.\nAttention: Legal Department, P.O.\nBox 520, San Francisco, CA 94104-0520.</p>\n<p>Looking for our previous version?
