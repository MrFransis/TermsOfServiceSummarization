Institute Privacy Policy\n<p>This privacy policy details the information about you that we collect, including personally identifiable information, to provide you with our programs and services.</p>\n<p>November 21, 2013</p> I.\nIntroduction <p> The Calyx Institute (\"Calyx\") is dedicated to preserving and protecting your privacy, and our Internet test bed, suite of Internet programs and services and educational programs that we recommend are designed from the ground up with that as Calyx's foremost objective.\nThis privacy policy (\"Privacy Policy\") details the information about you that we collect, including personally identifiable information (\"personal information\"), to provide you with our programs and services.\nPersonal information is information that can be used to identify you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>In summary</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We keep personal information only to the extent you provide it and we need it to communicate with you or recognize any contribution from you.</li>\n<li>We strive to protect your privacy, and limit the amount of your personal information we collect, retain and use in order to manage and maintain our mission and provide our services and programs.\nWe keep minimal logs of Internet activities other than on an aggregate basis to detect and correct problems with our servers which we will delete after we have resolved any problems.</li>\n<li>We do not sell or share personal information or data with other individuals or groups not affiliated with Calyx other than as necessary to upgrade, maintain and repair our network and infrastructure.</li>\n<li>We will attempt to defend your personal information from disclosure and to notify you of any requests for disclosure unless notification is prohibited by law.</li>\n<li>We do not monitor your Internet usage or communications.</li>\n<li>We encrypt all personal information that is stored on our network and servers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> We limit the amount of personal information we receive and retain, and thereby strive to protect your privacy.\nOur fundamental policy is to collect only the personal information that is essential to provide the programs and services we offer and plan to offer.\nWe pursue this goal in a variety of ways, including providing you with multiple ways of setting up, managing and paying for your membership, limiting the number of resources our Websites load from third parties, and using only a minimal number of session cookies.\nWe do not collect any personal information for the purpose of advertising, marketing, or consumer research.\nFurthermore, we do not collect information from other sources, such as credit information from credit agencies or commercially available demographic and marketing information from third parties, and we do not purchase e-mail lists from third parties.\n</p>\n<p> This Privacy Policy governs your privacy in connection with your use of the following Calyx programs and services:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Internet Services</b> (including the Calyx test bed and suite of Internet programs and services, collectively called \"Internet Services\").</li>\n<li>\n<b>Websites</b> (including calyxinstitute.org and calyx.net, collectively called \"Websites\").</li>\n<li>\n<b>Educational Programs and Materials</b> (including publications and training materials called \"Educational\nMaterials\", and presentations and forums called \"Educational Programs\", and collectively with Educational Materials called \"Educational Programs and Materials\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>As stated in our Terms of Use, of which this Privacy Policy is a part, by using the Internet Services and Websites, or by accessing our Educational Materials, or by registering for, or participating in our Educational Programs, you consent to our Terms of Use, and to the collection, retention and use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<p>\n</p> II.\nInformation That We Collect <p>\n</p> The personal information that we obtain about our users occurs primarily through four activities and only to the extent that you provide it to us: membership registration, payment processing, operating our Websites and providing our Internet Services and Educational Programs and Materials.\n<p>\n</p> A.\nPersonal Information <p>\n</p> Use of our Websites requires disclosure of limited personal information.\nYour IP address may be logged, but we will delete such logs on a regular basis.\nWe make our Websites available via the Tor Project\u2019s anonymity network as \"hidden services\" which makes it easier for users to cloak their true IP address and protect their web browsing metadata from third parties.\nWe may use cookies on our Websites for the purposes of tracking your session but we do not include third party cookies.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Calyx may provide Internet Services via its servers.\nConnecting to these servers may reveal your IP address, but as with our Websites logs, we plan to retain this information only for a limited period of time as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> We offer, and plan to offer, a number of Educational Programs and Materials to educate the public.\nSome of the Educational Materials may be available on our Websites, and browsing and downloading them will produce the same personal information that browsing our Websites in general produces.\nSome Educational Materials may be available only in physical form which could necessitate that you provide a delivery address to enable us to provide such Educational Materials to you.\nFinally, some Educational Programs may be conducted only at Calyx's offices or at other locations, and may require that you provide personal information, such as your name and membership number, to register your attendance in advance.\nFurthermore, such Educational Programs may be video or audio recorded and documented for preservation and promotional purposes.\nYour attendance at any Educational Program or other Calyx event constitutes your consent to being photographed and recorded and to having your image, likeness and voice included in those recordings for such purposes.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Calyx depends almost entirely on contributions from the public to provide its Internet Services, Websites and Educational Programs and Materials, and we strongly urge anyone who values our mission to become an active participant with Calyx.\nWithout your generous support, Calyx is unlikely to be able to provide its programs and services.\nIf you become a member of Calyx (\"Member\") we will collect the personal information that you provide, including your name, address, email address and telephone number.\nFurthermore, when you become a Member, you are assigned a unique membership identifier and we will collect payment information.\nIf you pay via either cash or Bitcoin, we retain no personal information other than the information you provide and your membership identifier.\nIf you pay by check, then we retain the information available on the check.\nIf you pay by credit card, Calyx retains the name, billing address, and credit card information necessary to charge your credit card.\nIf you establish a recurring credit card payment to pay for your membership, Calyx retains your name, billing address, and credit card information until we are notified that you cease to be a Member.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> If you become a Sustaining Member, and elect to subscribe to the wireless broadband service that is offered as a benefit to Sustaining Members and above, we also collect and retain information related to the equipment associated with your subscription.\nThis is only the membership identifier and the MAC address of the device.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Any personal information will be maintained and protected on an encrypted basis for as long as you are a Member or maintain your registration with us.\nIf you cease being a Member of Calyx, your personal information will be deleted promptly once we are no longer required to retain such information in accordance with our retention policy and applicable law.\n<p>\n</p> B.\nTechnical and Usage Information <p>\n</p> Calyx may collect aggregate information in order to ensure the quality of the network, Internet Services, Websites and Educational Programs and Materials.\nWe maintain this information only for as long as reasonably necessary.\n<p>\n</p> C.\nWe Do Not Collect or Retain Information from Children Under the Age of 13 <p>\n</p> Our programs and services, including our Websites and Internet Services, are not designed to attract or be used by children under the age of 13.\nWe do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 unless we first obtain permission from that child's parent or legal guardian.\nIf you are a parent and we have mistakenly collected information about your child.\nYou may alert us via email and we will delete the information we possess.\nThe address to email is help@calyxinstitute.org.\n<p>\n</p> D.\nA Note About Third Party Web Activity <p>\n</p> Please note that when you visit third party websites or utilize web services operated by third parties, your personal information may be collected and stored according to such third party\u2019s privacy policy.\nWe advise you to read carefully the privacy policies of the websites you visit and the services you use to maintain robust privacy protection.\nAlso, our Websites may link to files hosted on other sites.\nIn that case, those sites might track personal information that we cannot control.\n<p>\n</p> III.\nHow We Use This Information <p> We collect and maintain personal information as well as technical information only to the extent necessary to provide you with our programs and services.\nWe do not sell, and do not contemplate selling your personal or technical information to anyone for any reason other than in connection with the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Calyx to a third party which transfer must be approved by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York.\nWe will exercise our best efforts to provide notice on our Websites prior to such an event to enable any Member or other person registered with us to remove his/her personal information at that time.\n</p> A.\nPersonal Information <p> The confidentiality of your personal information is very important to us.\nWe will use your personal information only in connection with providing our Internet Services, Websites and Educational Programs and Materials.\nThus, membership information will be used for maintaining your registration and active membership.\nSpecific logging information will be used to diagnose problems with our Websites, and potentially to improve what we provide on our Websites.\nThese activities typically include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> To initiate, provide and manage the Internet Services, Websites and Educational Programs and Materials you have accessed, and to respond to your questions or comments.\n</li>\n<li> To bill, and collect, if any charge must be imposed, for our programs.\nservices and merchandise.\nand </li>\n<li> To communicate with you regarding service updates and the status of our programs and services.\n</li>\n</ul> B.\nTechnical and Usage Information <p> The confidentiality of technical information related to your use of our programs and services is also very important to us.\nWe use the technical information we collect only to address network integrity, quality control, capacity, misuse, viruses, and security issues, as well as for network planning, engineering and technical troubleshooting purposes.\nAdditionally, this information may be used in the case of any lawsuit initiated against Calyx, or to protect Calyx\u2019s rights.\n</p> IV.\nHow This Information Is Shared With Third Parties\n<p> It is our policy not to disclose your personal information to any individual not affiliated with Calyx without your express prior consent, other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as required by applicable law.\n</p>\n<p> Technical information related to your use of our service may be disclosed to a third party in connection with providing upgrades, or maintenance or repairs to our network and infrastructure.\nWe seek to require all third parties to be subject to contractual obligations to respect your personal information as provided under this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p> We reserve the right, however, to disclose your information, both personal and technical, if we have a good faith belief it is entirely necessary to comply with the law, protect the integrity of our programs and services, or act in an emergency to protect your safety or that of another.\nThis information will be shared only if the appropriate third party properly requests it.\nThis process is explained below.\n</p> V.\nHow We Respond to Requests for Data from Law Enforcement and Government Agencies\n<p> We will share personal information available to
