Who Is the Controller of Your Personal Information?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This policy describes how we handle your data when you use \u201cTimes Services,\u201d listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The New York Times newspaper, plus our International Edition</li>\n<li>Our websites, like nytimes.com</li>\n<li>Our apps, like the New York Times app and the New York Times Crossword app</li>\n<li>Our email newsletters, like Cooking and Morning Briefing</li>\n<li>Our pages or ads on social media networks, like our Facebook and Instagram pages</li>\n<li>Anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this Privacy Policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you use \u2014 and how you use them.\nWe use different information about print subscribers than website visitors.</p>\n<p>Be aware that certain Times Services work differently.\nSome have additional terms that supplement this policy (e.g., Reader Submissions).\nOthers refer to a different privacy policy altogether, so this one does not apply.</p>1.What Information Do We Gather About You?<p>The information we gather about you depends on the context.\nBy and large, it\u2019s information about you that can personally identify you \u2014 either on its own or when combined with other information.</p>\n<p>The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A) Information Collected Through Times Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Information You Voluntarily Give Us</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For Registration:</strong>\n<p>When you sign up for a Times Service (e.g., a subscription), we collect your contact information and account credentials.\nOnce you\u2019re registered, we assign you a unique ID number.\nThis ID number helps us recognize you when you\u2019re signed in.</p>\n<p>For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account.\nSee \u201cFrom Other Sources\u201d below.</p>\n<p>If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information (e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Billing:</strong>\n<p>To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information.</p>\n<p>This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For User-Generated Content:</strong>\n<p>We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read (e.g., comments or recipe reviews).\nAnyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts.\nSee the Comments F.A.Q., or read \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d in our Terms of Service for more information.</p>\n<p>We do not have to publish any of your content.\nIf the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, we will comply to the required extent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:</strong>\n<p>When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs:</strong>\n<p>We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs.\nWe also conduct similar research for advertisers.\nWe ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>During Contact With Our Call Centers:</strong>\n<p>We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Contacts Data:</strong>\n<p>We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.</p>\n<p>With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances (e.g., Refer a Friend campaigns).\nThis functionality is only meant for U.S.\nresidents.\nBy using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States \u2014 and that you have everyone\u2019s consent for us to use their contact information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With Tracking Technologies in Your Browser and Mobile Apps:</strong>\n<p>These technologies include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts, software development kits (or SDKs) and beyond.</p>\n<p>We track and store data about how you visit and use Times Services, particularly through our websites and apps.\nThe items we log include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP address</li>\n<li>Your location</li>\n<li>Your operating system</li>\n<li>Your browser</li>\n<li>Your browser language</li>\n<li>The URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps</li>\n<li>Device identifiers</li>\n<li>Advertising identifiers</li>\n<li>Other usage information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We combine this data with other information we collect about you.\nFor more information about tracking methods on Times Services, and how to manage them, read our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>If your browser doesn\u2019t accept our cookies, you can\u2019t access certain parts of our websites (e.g., your account on nytimes.com).\nBecause the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser-based standard signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance, we don\u2019t currently respond to those signals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With GPS Technologies:</strong>\n<p>Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location, if you enable this feature (e.g., the New York Times Real Estate app).\nYour GPS location is your exact location.</p>\n<p>You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the app.\nYou can edit that setting on your device at any time.\nIf you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app.\nIf you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider\u2019s servers \u2014 see below for the definition of service provider.</p>\n<p>If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific app does not have location-based features (e.g., the New York Times app), we don\u2019t collect your precise GPS location.\nWe do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location.\nAds on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate location, but are never targeted based on your GPS location.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>B) Information Collected From Other Sources.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Privately Owned Databases:</strong>\n<p>Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information \u2014 like public data, survey data and beyond.\nThis data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Social Media Platforms and Other Third-Party Services:</strong>\n<p>(Social media platforms include Facebook.\nThird-party services include Google, Kindle and Nook.)</p>\n<p>You can link your social media or other third-party account to a Times Service.\nBy linking the services, you authorize us to collect, store and use any information they may give us (e.g., your email address).\nYou can disconnect your nytimes.com registration from third-party accounts at any time.</p>\n<p>We also receive information from you when you interact with our pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms.\nThis includes aggregate data on our followers (e.g., age, gender and location), engagement data (e.g., \u201clikes,\u201d comments, shares, reposts and clicks), awareness data (e.g., number of impressions and reach) and individual users\u2019 public profiles.</p>\n<p>For more information, refer to our social login, Kindle and Nook F.A.Q.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Workplace and Schools:</strong>\n<p>When your employer or school buys an organizationwide subscription to nytimes.com, they sometimes provide us with your name and organization email address to grant you access as a user.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>A note about future updates:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are always improving our products and services, and we create new features regularly.\nThese updates sometimes require us to collect new information, or use what we already have differently.\nIf there is a significant or material change in the way we handle your personal information, we will notify you as detailed below.</p>Back to top2.What Do We Do With The Information We Collect About You?<p>\n<strong>A) We provide the Times Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making a Times Service available to you</li>\n<li>Arranging access to your account</li>\n<li>Providing customer service</li>\n<li>Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints</li>\n<li>Completing your payments and transactions</li>\n<li>Sending service-related messages (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions)</li>\n<li>Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches</li>\n<li>Displaying your Crossword stats</li>\n<li>Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>B) We Personalize Your Experience.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning.\nThis is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you\u2019ve already read.\nFor more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q.\nWe also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you\u2019ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any information you disclose in your content becomes public \u2014 along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We analyze data on our users\u2019 subscription, purchase and usage behaviors.\nThis helps us make business and marketing decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services.\nIt helps us determine whether our marketing is successful.\nIt also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use.\nYou can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.</li>\n<li>For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.</li>\n<li>For customer satisfaction: We assess users\u2019 satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (\u201cservice providers\u201d) with whom we share your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions.\nSome might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We gather data and work with third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers.\nThis data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide (e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information.\nWe only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity.\nFor example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services.\nGoogle uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on you visiting nytimes.com and other sites.\nYou can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the related Google privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers.\nTo do this, we combine information we collect through surveys with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps.\nThis combined information is used to build models.\nThese data models are then used to measure users\u2019 attributes, like their demographic information or their interests.\nWorking with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes.\nEach group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our site and apps.</p>\n<p>Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations.\nTimes Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us.\nThese vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting.\nIf you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor\u2019s URL, we may earn a commission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional notes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the DAA Webchoices Browser Check and NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising.\nYou can download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps.\nYou can also follow the instructions in the What Are Your Rights? section below.</li>\n<li>We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you.\nMany of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own.<br>\n<br>Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients.\nThis helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.</li>\n<li>These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads.\ncheck their privacy policies for more details.\nFor further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable Cookie Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>H) We Advertise Times Services to You.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We market our properties to you.\nSometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.</p>\n<p>We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties.\nOften these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed or purchased anything.\nThe ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.</p>\n<p>We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service.\nThe third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data.\nBecause of how this matching process works, the third party can\u2019t read our encrypted customer list if they don\u2019t already have it.</p>\n<p>To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable third parties.\nFor example, when we use \u201cCustom Audience\u201d to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out.\nWe are not responsible for any third party\u2019s failure to comply with opt-out requests.</p>\n<p>We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails.\nFor information on opting out of these emails, see What Are Your Rights?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information Into Larger Findings.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, under applicable laws.\nThis helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results.\nWe can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.</p>Back to top3.With Whom Do We Share the Information We Gather?<p>\n<strong>A) Within The New York Times Company:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share your information with our affiliates for the purposes listed here.\nSee a list of our affiliates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B) With Service Providers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We work with service providers, as defined above, to carry out certain tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processing your payments</li>\n<li>Fulfilling your orders</li>\n<li>Maintaining technology and related infrastructure</li>\n<li>Offering you customer service</li>\n<li>Serving and targeting ads</li>\n<li>Measuring ad performance</li>\n<li>Presenting surveys</li>\n<li>Shipping you products and mailings</li>\n<li>Distributing emails</li>\n<li>List processing and analytics</li>\n<li>Managing and analyzing research</li>\n<li>Managing promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your personal information.</p>\n<p>We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) With Other Third Parties:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are situations when we share your information with third parties beyond our service providers.\nWe never share your email address with these third parties without your consent, except in encrypted form to engage in the matched ads process described above.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you\u2019re a U.S.\nprint subscriber, we may share your name and mailing address (among other information) with other reputable companies that want to market to you by mail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We share information about our live event and conference attendees (e.g., your name, your company or your job title) with the event sponsors.\nIn those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We share information about participants in our sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions with the promotions\u2019 sponsors.\nIn those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We process payments you make through Times Services with external services.</p>\n<p>There are two ways this can happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect your information and share it with the third-party service for processing.</li>\n<li>The third-party service collects your information for processing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we would have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your information to a third party \u2014 such as an acquiring entity and its advisers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can preserve or share personal information if the law requires us to do so.\nWe can also preserve or share personal information if we believe it would be necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with the law or with legal process</li>\n<li>Protect and defend our rights and property</li>\n<li>Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Times Services</li>\n<li>Protect the safety or property of our users or the general public (e.g., if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, we could share your information to help investigations into your actions)</li>\n<li>Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside your country of residence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats.\nYour public activities could thus appear on other websites, blogs or feeds.</li>\n</ol>Back to top4.What Are Your Rights?<p>\n<strong>A) How Do I Opt Out of Email, Phone, Mail and Push Notifications?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The opt-out methods described below are limited to the email address, phone or device used.\nThey won\u2019t affect subsequent subscriptions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Email:</strong>\n<p>We offer a variety of commercial emails and email newsletters.\nYou can unsubscribe from them by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d instructions near the bottom of the email.\nYou can also email us at privacy@nytimes.com.</p>\n<p>You can manage your nytimes.com newsletter preferences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Mail or Telephone Promotions:</strong>\n<p>You can ask us to unsubscribe from our mail or telephone solicitations.\nYou can also ask us to not share your information with third parties for marketing purposes.\nTo do so, email us at privacy@nytimes.com with \u201cOpt Out\u201d in the subject line, and your account number and phone number in the body of the email.</p>\n<p>You can write to us at: Customer Care, P.O.\nBox 8041, Davenport, IA 52808-8041 \u2014 or, for International Edition customers, The New York Times International Edition, Immeuble Le Lavoisier, 4, Place des Vosges, CS 10001, 92052 Paris La D\u00e9fense Cedex, France.\nPlease include your account number and phone number in the body of the letter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Push Notifications:</strong>\n<p>You can opt out any time by adjusting your device settings, or uninstalling our app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Text Messages:</strong>\n<p>You can opt out of text alerts any time by replying \u201cSTOP,\u201d or any alternative keyword we\u2019ve shared with you.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We complete any opt-out request as quickly as we can.\nThis opt-out request won\u2019t prohibit us from sending you important nonmarketing notices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B) How Do You Access, Change, Delete, Update or Exercise Your Other Rights in Relation to Your Personal Information?</strong>\n<br>In some parts of the world, you have the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access, modify, or delete the personal information we have about you</li>\n<li>Receive an electronic copy of the personal information we have about you, for data portability</li>\n<li>Restrict, or object to, how we process personal information about you</li>\n<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal information based on our legitimate interest or that of a third party \u2014 unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing of, or the keeping of, your personal information for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to exercise any of the above rights, contact us via this form or by calling us at our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES.\nIn your request, please be specific.\nState the information you want changed, whether you\u2019d like your information suppressed from our database or whether there are limitations you\u2019d like us to put on how we use your personal information.\nPlease use the email address linked to that personal information \u2014 we only complete requests on the information linked to your email address.\nTo verify your identity, we will email the email address you provide us, and which matches our records, and wait for your response.\nIn some instances we may also ask for additional information.\nThis is how we verify your identity before complying.</p>\n<p>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.\nIn order to do that, please provide the agent with written permission, signed by you, authorizing the agent to submit the request on your behalf.\nThe agent must submit that written permission along with the request.\nWe will contact you to verify your identity \u2014 and the authorized agent\u2019s permission \u2014 before a response to the request is sent.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll respond to your request in a manner consistent with applicable law.</p>\n<p>We might need to keep certain information for recordkeeping purposes, or to complete a transaction you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., if you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you might not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of the purchase or promotion).</p>\n<p>In some cases, your request doesn\u2019t ensure complete removal of the content or information (e.g., if another user has reposted your content).</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like, you can lodge a complaint with a data protection authority.\nA list of E.U.\ndata protection authorities is available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) How Do You Manage Your Digital and Home Delivery Accounts?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can update your account information and see your transaction history (for International Edition print subscribers).\nIf you need assistance, call our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES.\nOther local numbers are available.</p>\n<p>It works differently if you subscribed via Apple\u2019s App Store or Google Play.\nRegister with us to access the Account area, and contact Apple or Google for your transaction history.</p>Back to top5.What About Sensitive Personal Information?<p>We generally don\u2019t want to gather any sensitive information about you.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your social security number</li>\n<li>Your racial or ethnic origin</li>\n<li>Your political opinions</li>\n<li>Your religion or other beliefs</li>\n<li>Your health, biometric or genetic characteristics</li>\n<li>Any trade union membership</li>\n<li>Any criminal background</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are rare situations when we request this information (e.g., a reader survey asks about your political leanings), but you can decline to answer.\nOutside those situations we would prefer you never share that information with us.</p>Back to top6.How Long Do You Retain Data?<p>It depends.\nWe store your personal information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law).\nThis means we might retain your personal information even after you close your account with us.</p>\n<p>When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long we have had a relationship with you or provided a Times Service to you</li>\n<li>Whether we are subject to any legal obligations (e.g., any laws that require us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time before we can delete them)</li>\n<li>Whether we have taken any legal positions (e.g., in connection with any statutes of limitation).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying details.</p>Back to top7.How Do You Protect My Information?<p>We protect your personal information with a series of organizational, technological and physical safeguards \u2014 but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nWe recommend that you use complex and unique passwords for your Times accounts and for third-party accounts linked to them.\nDo not share your password with anyone.</p>\n<p>If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure, notify us immediately.</p>Back to top8.Are There Guidelines for Children?<p>Times Services are intended for a general audience, and are not directed at children under (13) years of age.</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly gather personal information (as defined by the U.S.\nChildren\u2019s Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA) in a manner not permitted by COPPA.\nIf you are a parent or guardian and you believe we have collected information from your child in a manner not permitted by law, contact us at privacy@nytimes.com.\nWe will remove the data to the extent required by applicable laws.</p>Back to top9.How Is Information Transferred Internationally?<p>The New York Times Company is headquartered in the United States.\nIf you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States \u2014 or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.</p>\n<p>If we transfer your data out of the European Economic Area (E.E.A.), we implement at least one of the three following safeguards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to E.E.A.\nstandards (see the full list of these countries).</li>\n<li>We use a service provider in the United States that is Privacy Shield certified.</li>\n<li>We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by E.U.\nStandard Contractual Clauses to protect your personal data.\nYou can see a copy of these clauses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.</p>Back to top10.What Is Our Legal Basis?<p>In some jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we only collect, use or share information about you when we have a valid reason.\nThis is called \u201clawful basis.\u201d Specifically, this is one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your information</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The performance of the contract we have with you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The legitimate interests of The Times or a third party.\n\u201cLegitimate interest\u201d is a technical term under international laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.\nIt means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests.\n\u201cLegitimate interest\u201d also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact.</p>We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure.\n(2) to administer and generally conduct business within The New York Times Company.\n(3) to prevent fraud.\nand (4) to conduct our marketing activities.</li>\n</ul>Back to top11.What About Links to Third-Party Services?<p>Some Times Services contain links to third-party websites, resources, vendors and advertisers.\nThese third parties are not Times Services.\nWe do not control (and are not responsible for) third party content or privacy practices.\nAny personal data you provide to them is not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>Back to top12.How Are Changes to This Privacy Policy Communicated?<p>We periodically update this Privacy Policy.\nWe will post any changes on this page by updating this policy.</p>\n<p>If we make a significant or material change in the

Services.\nIf you object to any change, you can stop using the Times Services.</p>\n<p>After we post any changes on this page, your continued use of Times Services is subject to the updated Privacy

Times newspaper, plus our International Edition</li>\n<li>Our websites, like nytimes.com</li>\n<li>Our apps, like the New York Times app and the New York Times Crossword app</li>\n<li>Our email newsletters, like Cooking and Morning Briefing</li>\n<li>Our pages or ads on social media networks, like our Facebook and Instagram pages</li>\n<li>Anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this Privacy Policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you use \u2014 and how you use them.\nWe use different information about print subscribers than website visitors.</p>\n<p>Be aware that certain Times Services work differently.\nSome have additional terms that supplement this policy (e.g., Reader Submissions).\nOthers refer to a different privacy policy altogether, so this one does not apply.</p>1.What Information Do We Gather About You?<p>The information we gather about you depends on the context.\nBy and large, it\u2019s information about you that can personally identify you \u2014 either on its own or when combined with other information.</p>\n<p>The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A) Information Collected Through Times Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Information You Voluntarily Give Us</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For Registration:</strong>\n<p>When you sign up for a Times Service (e.g., a subscription), we collect your contact information and account credentials.\nOnce you\u2019re registered, we assign you a unique ID number.\nThis ID number helps us recognize you when you\u2019re signed in.</p>\n<p>For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account.\nSee \u201cFrom Other Sources\u201d below.</p>\n<p>If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information (e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Billing:</strong>\n<p>To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information.</p>\n<p>This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For User-Generated Content:</strong>\n<p>We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read (e.g., comments or recipe reviews).\nAnyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts.\nSee the Comments F.A.Q., or read \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d in our Terms of Service for more information.</p>\n<p>We do not have to publish any of your content.\nIf the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, we will comply to the required extent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:</strong>\n<p>When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs:</strong>\n<p>We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs.\nWe also conduct similar research for advertisers.\nWe ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>During Contact With Our Call Centers:</strong>\n<p>We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Contacts Data:</strong>\n<p>We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.</p>\n<p>With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances (e.g., Refer a Friend campaigns).\nThis functionality is only meant for U.S.\nresidents.\nBy using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States \u2014 and that you have everyone\u2019s consent for us to use their contact information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With Tracking Technologies in Your Browser and Mobile Apps:</strong>\n<p>These technologies include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts, software development kits (or SDKs) and beyond.</p>\n<p>We track and store data about how you visit and use Times Services, particularly through our websites and apps.\nThe items we log include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP address</li>\n<li>Your location</li>\n<li>Your operating system</li>\n<li>Your browser</li>\n<li>Your browser language</li>\n<li>The URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps</li>\n<li>Device identifiers</li>\n<li>Advertising identifiers</li>\n<li>Other usage information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We combine this data with other information we collect about you.\nFor more information about tracking methods on Times Services, and how to manage them, read our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>If your browser doesn\u2019t accept our cookies, you can\u2019t access certain parts of our websites (e.g., your account on nytimes.com).\nBecause the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser-based standard signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance, we don\u2019t currently respond to those signals.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With GPS Technologies:</strong>\n<p>Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location, if you enable this feature (e.g., the New York Times Real Estate app).\nYour GPS location is your exact location.</p>\n<p>You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the app.\nYou can edit that setting on your device at any time.\nIf you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app.\nIf you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider\u2019s servers \u2014 see below for the definition of service provider.</p>\n<p>If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific app does not have location-based features (e.g., the New York Times app), we don\u2019t collect your precise GPS location.\nWe do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location.\nAds on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate location, but are never targeted based on your GPS location.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>B) Information Collected From Other Sources.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Privately Owned Databases:</strong>\n<p>Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information \u2014 like public data, survey data and beyond.\nThis data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Social Media Platforms and Other Third-Party Services:</strong>\n<p>(Social media platforms include Facebook.\nThird-party services include Google, Kindle and Nook.)</p>\n<p>You can link your social media or other third-party account to a Times Service.\nBy linking the services, you authorize us to collect, store and use any information they may give us (e.g., your email address).\nYou can disconnect your nytimes.com registration from third-party accounts at any time.</p>\n<p>We also receive information from you when you interact with our pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms.\nThis includes aggregate data on our followers (e.g., age, gender and location), engagement data (e.g., \u201clikes,\u201d comments, shares, reposts and clicks), awareness data (e.g., number of impressions and reach) and individual users\u2019 public profiles.</p>\n<p>For more information, refer to our social login, Kindle and Nook F.A.Q.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Workplace and Schools:</strong>\n<p>When your employer or school buys an organizationwide subscription to nytimes.com, they sometimes provide us with your name and organization email address to grant you access as a user.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>A note about future updates:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are always improving our products and services, and we create new features regularly.\nThese updates sometimes require us to collect new information, or use what we already have differently.\nIf there is a significant or material change in the way we handle your personal information, we will notify you as detailed below.</p>Back to top2.What Do We Do With The Information We Collect About You?<p>\n<strong>A) We provide the Times Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making a Times Service available to you</li>\n<li>Arranging access to your account</li>\n<li>Providing customer service</li>\n<li>Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints</li>\n<li>Completing your payments and transactions</li>\n<li>Sending service-related messages (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions)</li>\n<li>Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches</li>\n<li>Displaying your Crossword stats</li>\n<li>Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>B) We Personalize Your Experience.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning.\nThis is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you\u2019ve already read.\nFor more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q.\nWe also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you\u2019ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any information you disclose in your content becomes public \u2014 along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We analyze data on our users\u2019 subscription, purchase and usage behaviors.\nThis helps us make business and marketing decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services.\nIt helps us determine whether our marketing is successful.\nIt also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use.\nYou can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.</li>\n<li>For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.</li>\n<li>For customer satisfaction: We assess users\u2019 satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (\u201cservice providers\u201d) with whom we share your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions.\nSome might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We gather data and work with third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers.\nThis data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide (e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information.\nWe only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity.\nFor example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services.\nGoogle uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on you visiting nytimes.com and other sites.\nYou can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the related Google privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers.\nTo do this, we combine information we collect through surveys with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps.\nThis combined information is used to build models.\nThese data models are then used to measure users\u2019 attributes, like their demographic information or their interests.\nWorking with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes.\nEach group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our site and apps.</p>\n<p>Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations.\nTimes Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us.\nThese vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting.\nIf you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor\u2019s URL, we may earn a commission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional notes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the DAA Webchoices Browser Check and NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising.\nYou can download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps.\nYou can also follow the instructions in the What Are Your Rights? section below.</li>\n<li>We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you.\nMany of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own.<br>\n<br>Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients.\nThis helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.</li>\n<li>These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads.\ncheck their privacy policies for more details.\nFor further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable Cookie Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>H) We Advertise Times Services to You.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We market our properties to you.\nSometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.</p>\n<p>We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties.\nOften these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed or purchased anything.\nThe ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.</p>\n<p>We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service.\nThe third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data.\nBecause of how this matching process works, the third party can\u2019t read our encrypted customer list if they don\u2019t already have it.</p>\n<p>To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable third parties.\nFor example, when we use \u201cCustom Audience\u201d to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out.\nWe are not responsible for any third party\u2019s failure to comply with opt-out requests.</p>\n<p>We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails.\nFor information on opting out of these emails, see What Are Your Rights?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information Into Larger Findings.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, under applicable laws.\nThis helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results.\nWe can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.</p>Back to top3.With Whom Do We Share the Information We Gather?<p>\n<strong>A) Within The New York Times Company:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share your information with our affiliates for the purposes listed here.\nSee a list of our affiliates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B) With Service Providers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We work with service providers, as defined above, to carry out certain tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processing your payments</li>\n<li>Fulfilling your orders</li>\n<li>Maintaining technology and related infrastructure</li>\n<li>Offering you customer service</li>\n<li>Serving and targeting ads</li>\n<li>Measuring ad performance</li>\n<li>Presenting surveys</li>\n<li>Shipping you products and mailings</li>\n<li>Distributing emails</li>\n<li>List processing and analytics</li>\n<li>Managing and analyzing research</li>\n<li>Managing promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your personal information.</p>\n<p>We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) With Other Third Parties:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are situations when we share your information with third parties beyond our service providers.\nWe never share your email address with these third parties without your consent, except in encrypted form to engage in the matched ads process described above.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you\u2019re a U.S.\nprint subscriber, we may share your name and mailing address (among other information) with other reputable companies that want to market to you by mail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We share information about our live event and conference attendees (e.g., your name, your company or your job title) with the event sponsors.\nIn those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We share information about participants in our sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions with the promotions\u2019 sponsors.\nIn those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We process payments you make through Times Services with external services.</p>\n<p>There are two ways this can happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect your information and share it with the third-party service for processing.</li>\n<li>The third-party service collects your information for processing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we would have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your information to a third party \u2014 such as an acquiring entity and its advisers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can preserve or share personal information if the law requires us to do so.\nWe can also preserve or share personal information if we believe it would be necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with the law or with legal process</li>\n<li>Protect and defend our rights and property</li>\n<li>Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Times Services</li>\n<li>Protect the safety or property of our users or the general public (e.g., if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, we could share your information to help investigations into your actions)</li>\n<li>Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside your country of residence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats.\nYour public activities could thus appear on other websites, blogs or feeds.</li>\n</ol>Back to top4.What Are Your Rights?<p>\n<strong>A) How Do I Opt Out of Email, Phone, Mail and Push Notifications?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The opt-out methods described below are limited to

letter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Push Notifications:</strong>\n<p>You can opt out any time by adjusting your device settings, or uninstalling our app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Text Messages:</strong>\n<p>You can opt out of text alerts any time by replying \u201cSTOP,\u201d or any alternative keyword we\u2019ve shared with you.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We complete any opt-out

Your Other Rights in Relation to Your Personal Information?</strong>\n<br>In some parts of the world, you have the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access, modify, or delete the personal information we have about you</li>\n<li>Receive an electronic copy of the personal information we have about you, for data portability</li>\n<li>Restrict, or object to, how we process personal information about

exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019d like to exercise any of the above rights, contact us via this form or by calling us at our toll-free number, 1-800-NYTIMES.\nIn your request, please be specific.\nState the information you want changed, whether you\u2019d like your information suppressed from our database or whether there are limitations you\u2019d like us to put on how we use your personal information.\nPlease use the email address linked to that personal information \u2014 we only complete requests on the information linked to your email address.\nTo verify your identity, we will email the email address you provide us, and which matches our records, and wait for your response.\nIn some instances we may also ask for additional information.\nThis is how we

certain information for recordkeeping purposes, or to complete a transaction you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., if you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you might not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of the purchase or promotion).</p>\n<p>In some cases, your request doesn\u2019t ensure complete removal of the

situations we would prefer you never share that information with us.</p>Back to top6.How Long Do You Retain Data?<p>It depends.\nWe store your personal information for as long as needed, or permitted, based on the reason why we obtained it (consistent with applicable law).\nThis means we might retain your personal information even after you close your account with us.</p>\n<p>When deciding how long to keep your information, we consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How long we have had a relationship with you or provided a Times Service to you</li>\n<li>Whether we are subject to any legal obligations (e.g., any laws that require us to keep transaction records for a certain period of time before we can delete them)</li>\n<li>Whether we have taken any legal positions (e.g., in connection with any statutes of limitation).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rather than delete your data, we might de-identify it by removing identifying details.</p>Back to top7.How Do You Protect My Information?<p>We protect your personal information with a series of organizational, technological and physical safeguards \u2014 but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.\nWe recommend that you use complex and unique passwords for

Is Information Transferred Internationally?<p>The New York Times Company is headquartered in the United States.\nIf you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your

Economic Area (E.E.A.), we implement at least one of the three following safeguards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We transfer your information to countries that have been recognized by the European Commission as

certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.</p>Back to top10.What Is Our Legal Basis?<p>In some jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we only collect, use or share information about you when we have a valid reason.\nThis is called

performance of the contract we have with you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject or</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The legitimate interests of The Times or a third party.\n\u201cLegitimate interest\u201d is a technical term under international laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.\nIt means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests.\n\u201cLegitimate interest\u201d also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact.</p>We have a legitimate interest in gathering and processing personal information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure.\n(2) to administer and generally conduct business within The New York Times Company.\n(3) to prevent fraud.\nand (4) to conduct our marketing activities.</li>\n</ul>Back to

Times newspaper, plus our International Edition</li>\n<li>Our websites, like nytimes.com</li>\n<li>Our apps, like the New York Times app and the New York Times Crossword app</li>\n<li>Our email newsletters, like Cooking and Morning Briefing</li>\n<li>Our pages or ads on social media networks, like our Facebook and Instagram pages</li>\n<li>Anywhere we gather information from you and refer you to this Privacy Policy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How we handle information about you depends on which Times Services you use \u2014 and how you use them.\nWe use different information about print subscribers than website visitors.</p>\n<p>Be aware that certain Times Services work differently.\nSome have additional terms that supplement this policy (e.g., Reader Submissions).\nOthers refer to a different privacy policy altogether, so this one does not apply.</p>1.What Information Do We Gather About You?<p>The information we gather about you depends on the context.\nBy and large, it\u2019s information about you that can personally identify you \u2014 either on its own or when combined with other information.</p>\n<p>The following describes the information we collect and how we obtain it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A) Information Collected Through Times Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Information You Voluntarily Give Us</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For Registration:</strong>\n<p>When you sign up for a Times Service (e.g., a subscription), we collect your contact information and account credentials.\nOnce you\u2019re registered, we assign you a unique ID number.\nThis ID number helps us recognize you when you\u2019re signed in.</p>\n<p>For some Times Services, you can instead sign up by linking your Apple, Facebook or Google account.\nSee \u201cFrom Other Sources\u201d below.</p>\n<p>If you register for an event or conference, we might ask for additional information (e.g., your company name, your job title or your dietary restrictions).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Billing:</strong>\n<p>To process payments or donations, we collect and use your payment information.</p>\n<p>This can include your name, your address, your telephone number, your email address, your credit or debit card information and any other relevant information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For User-Generated Content:</strong>\n<p>We offer you the ability to post content that other users can read (e.g., comments or recipe reviews).\nAnyone can read, collect and use any personal information that accompanies your posts.\nSee the Comments F.A.Q., or read \u201cUser-Generated Content\u201d in our Terms of Service for more information.</p>\n<p>We do not have to publish any of your content.\nIf the law requires us to take down, remove or edit your personal information, we will comply to the required extent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers:</strong>\n<p>When you sign up for these, you give us your name, email and any other required information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Reader Surveys, Research, Panels and Experience Programs:</strong>\n<p>We gather information through questionnaires, surveys and feedback programs.\nWe also conduct similar research for advertisers.\nWe ask you for your consent to use this information when you participate in these programs and events.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>During Contact With Our Call Centers:</strong>\n<p>We collect information from you when you place an order over the phone or contact customer service through one of our toll-free numbers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Contacts Data:</strong>\n<p>We never scan your device for your contacts or upload that data.</p>\n<p>With your consent, we do comply with your requests to collect data about your friends, family or acquaintances (e.g., Refer a Friend campaigns).\nThis functionality is only meant for U.S.\nresidents.\nBy using it, you acknowledge and agree that both you and your contacts are based in the United States \u2014 and that you have everyone\u2019s consent for us to use their contact information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With Tracking Technologies in Your Browser and Mobile Apps:</strong>\n<p>These technologies include cookies, web beacons, tags and scripts, software development kits (or SDKs) and beyond.</p>\n<p>We track and store data about how you visit and use Times Services, particularly through our websites and apps.\nThe items we log include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your IP address</li>\n<li>Your location</li>\n<li>Your operating system</li>\n<li>Your browser</li>\n<li>Your browser language</li>\n<li>The URLs of any pages you visit on our sites and apps</li>\n<li>Device identifiers</li>\n<li>Advertising identifiers</li>\n<li>Other usage information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We combine this data with other information we collect about you.\nFor more information about tracking methods on Times Services, and how to manage them, read our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>If your browser doesn\u2019t accept our cookies, you can\u2019t access certain parts of our websites (e.g., your account on nytimes.com).\nBecause the \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser-based standard signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance, we don\u2019t currently respond to those signals.\nWe however respond to the Global Privacy Control in certain territories, such as Europe and California.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>With GPS Technologies:</strong>\n<p>Some of our apps can provide content based on your GPS location, if you enable this feature (e.g., the New York Times Real Estate app).\nYour GPS location is your exact location.</p>\n<p>You choose whether to enable GPS features when you first install the app.\nYou can edit that setting on your device at any time.\nIf you enable these features, your GPS location can be found by satellite, cell phone tower or Wi-Fi and used by the app.\nIf you save a location-based search in your history, that data moves to our service provider\u2019s servers \u2014 see below for the definition of service provider.</p>\n<p>If you do not enable GPS location-based services, or if a specific app does not have location-based features (e.g., the New York Times app), we don\u2019t collect your precise GPS location.\nWe do collect your IP address, which can establish your approximate location.\nAds on our sites and apps may be targeted based on this approximate location, but are never targeted based on your GPS location.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>B) Information Collected From Other Sources.</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Privately Owned Databases:</strong>\n<p>Marketing, data analytic and social media-owned databases give us access to a range of information \u2014 like public data, survey data and beyond.\nThis data sometimes includes your mailing address, your gender, your age, your household income and other demographic data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Social Media Platforms and Other Third-Party Services:</strong>\n<p>(Social media platforms include Facebook.\nThird-party services include Google and Nook.)</p>\n<p>You can link your social media or other third-party account to a Times Service.\nBy linking the services, you authorize us to collect, store and use any information they may give us (e.g., your email address).\nYou can disconnect your nytimes.com registration from third-party accounts at any time.</p>\n<p>We also receive information from you when you interact with our pages, groups, accounts or posts on social media platforms.\nThis includes aggregate data on our followers (e.g., age, gender and location), engagement data (e.g., \u201clikes,\u201d comments, shares, reposts and clicks), awareness data (e.g., number of impressions and reach) and individual users\u2019 public profiles.</p>\n<p>For more information, refer to our social login and Nook F.A.Q.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Workplace and Schools:</strong>\n<p>When your employer or school buys an organizationwide subscription to nytimes.com, they sometimes provide us with your name and organization email address to grant you access as a user.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>A note about future updates:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are always improving our products and services, and we create new features regularly.\nThese updates sometimes require us to collect new information, or use what we already have differently.\nIf there is a significant or material change in the way we handle your personal information, we will notify you as detailed below.</p>Back to top2.What Do We Do With The Information We Collect About You?<p>\n<strong>A) We provide the Times Services.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use your information to help you use and navigate Times Services, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making a Times Service available to you</li>\n<li>Arranging access to your account</li>\n<li>Providing customer service</li>\n<li>Responding to your inquiries, requests, suggestions or complaints</li>\n<li>Completing your payments and transactions</li>\n<li>Sending service-related messages (e.g., a change in our terms and conditions)</li>\n<li>Saving your reading list, recipes or property searches</li>\n<li>Displaying your Crossword stats</li>\n<li>Letting you take part in paid services, polls, promotions, surveys, panels, research and comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>B) We Personalize Your Experience.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We track your interests and reading habits (e.g., the articles you read) to personalize your reading experience using technology like algorithmic recommendations and machine learning.\nThis is how we highlight articles you might be interested in and de-emphasize articles you\u2019ve already read.\nFor more information about content personalization on Times Services, you can read the Personalization F.A.Q.\nWe also show you prices, promotions, products or services we believe you\u2019ll find interesting, based on demographic and usage data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) We Allow You to Share User-Generated Content.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any information you disclose in your content becomes public \u2014 along with your chosen screen name and uploaded photo.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>D) We Develop Products and Services, and Do Analysis.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We analyze data on our users\u2019 subscription, purchase and usage behaviors.\nThis helps us make business and marketing decisions.</p>\n<p>For example, our analysis lets us predict preferences and price points for our products and services.\nIt helps us determine whether our marketing is successful.\nIt also shows us characteristics about our readers, which we sometimes share in aggregate with advertisers.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics is one of the analytics providers we use.\nYou can find out how Google Analytics uses data and how to opt out of Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E) We Carry Out Administrative Tasks.</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For auditing: We verify that our internal processes work as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.</li>\n<li>For fraud and security monitoring: We detect and prevent cyberattacks or unauthorized robot activities.</li>\n<li>For customer satisfaction: We assess users\u2019 satisfaction with Times Services and our customer care team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above activities can involve outside companies, agents or contractors (\u201cservice providers\u201d) with whom we share your personal information for these purposes (discussed further below).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F) We Offer Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can take part in our sweepstakes, contests and other promotions.\nSome might have additional rules about how we use and disclose your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G) We Allow for Personalized Advertising on Times Services and Create Audiences for Third-Party Advertisers.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We gather data and work with third parties to show you personalized ads on behalf of advertisers.\nThis data comes from ad tracking technologies set by us or the third party (e.g., cookies), the information you provide (e.g., your email address), your use of Times Services (e.g., your reading history), information from advertisers or advertising vendors (e.g., demographic data) and anything inferred from any of this information.\nWe only use or share this information in a manner that does not reveal your identity.\nFor example, we use Google to serve ads on Times Services.\nGoogle uses cookies or unique device identifiers, in combination with their own data, to show you ads based on you visiting nytimes.com and other sites.\nYou can opt out of the use of the Google cookie by visiting the related Google privacy policy.</p>\n<p>We also identify groups of users to whom to serve personalized ads on behalf of our advertisers.\nTo do this, we combine information we collect through surveys or registration with information we collect automatically using tracking technologies while you browse our sites and apps.\nThis combined information is used to build models.\nThese data models are then used to measure users\u2019 attributes, like their demographic information or their interests.\nWorking with service providers, we use these measurements to group users by common attributes.\nEach group is associated with a random ID which is then passed to our ad server for use in targeting ad campaigns on our sites and apps.</p>\n<p>Another example is our affiliate link vendors, which we use in our guides and product recommendations.\nTimes Services include links that will send you to vendor URLs and other services not operated or controlled by us.\nThese vendors use cookies and other technologies to collect information about your navigation from the Times Services to the merchant you are visiting.\nIf you buy a product after following a link to a link vendor\u2019s URL, we may earn a commission.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Additional notes:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For more about targeted advertising, and how to opt out with your specific browser and device, go to the DAA Webchoices Browser Check and NAI Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising.\nYou can download the AppChoices app to opt out in mobile apps.\nYou can also follow the instructions in the What Are Your Rights? section below.</li>\n<li>We try to limit how our third-party advertising technology vendors use the information they gather from you.\nMany of these providers require us to enter into contracts that allow them to optimize their own services and products, or that help them create their own.<br>\n<br>Essentially, these providers combine any information they gather about you through Times Services with information they receive from their other clients.\nThis helps them target ads to you on behalf of their other clients, not just us.</li>\n<li>These third parties sometimes use other services in order to serve ads.\ncheck their privacy policies for more details.\nFor further information on tracking technologies and your rights and choices regarding them, see the applicable Cookie Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>H) We Advertise Times Services to You.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We market our properties to you.\nSometimes we use marketing vendors to do this.</p>\n<p>We serve ads through websites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties.\nOften these ads are targeted at people who have visited or registered for a Times Service but have not subscribed or purchased anything.\nThe ads are also targeted at people with similar traits or behaviors to our subscribers or customers.</p>\n<p>We target our advertising to these users by uploading an encrypted customer list to a third party, or by incorporating a tracking technology from a third party onto our Times Service.\nThe third party then matches individuals who appear in both our data and their data.\nBecause of how this matching process works, the third party can\u2019t read our encrypted customer list if they don\u2019t already have it.</p>\n<p>To opt out of receiving these matched ads, contact the applicable third parties.\nFor example, when we use \u201cCustom Audience\u201d to serve you our ad through Facebook, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of that Facebook ad and opt out.\nWe are not responsible for any third party\u2019s failure to comply with opt-out requests.</p>\n<p>We periodically send you targeted email newsletters or promotional emails.\nFor information on opting out of these emails, see What Are Your Rights?</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I) We Aggregate (or De-identify) Personal Information Into Larger Findings.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, under applicable laws.\nThis helps us better understand and represent our users, such as when we measure ad performance, create advertising interest-based segments or compile survey results.\nWe can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise.</p>Back to top3.With Whom Do We Share the Information We Gather?<p>\n<strong>A) Within The New York Times Company:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We share your information with our affiliates for the purposes listed here.\nSee a list of our affiliates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B) With Service Providers:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We work with service providers, as defined above, to carry out certain tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processing your payments</li>\n<li>Fulfilling your orders</li>\n<li>Maintaining technology and related infrastructure</li>\n<li>Offering you customer service</li>\n<li>Serving and targeting ads</li>\n<li>Measuring ad performance</li>\n<li>Presenting surveys</li>\n<li>Shipping you products and mailings</li>\n<li>Distributing emails</li>\n<li>List processing and analytics</li>\n<li>Managing and analyzing research</li>\n<li>Managing promotions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When performing these tasks, service providers often have access to your personal information.</p>\n<p>We sometimes allow them to use aggregated or de-identified information for other purposes, in accordance with applicable laws</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C) With Other Third Parties:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There are situations when we share your information with third parties beyond our service providers.\nWe never share your email address with these third parties without your consent, except in encrypted form to engage in the matched ads process described above.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If you\u2019re a U.S.\nprint subscriber, we may share your name and mailing address (among other information) with other reputable companies that want to market to you by mail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We share information about our live event and conference attendees (e.g., your name, your company or your job title) with the event sponsors.\nIn those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We share information about participants in our sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions with the promotions\u2019 sponsors.\nIn those cases we notify you when you provide us the information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We process payments you make through Times Services with external services.</p>\n<p>There are two ways this can happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect your information and share it with the third-party service for processing.</li>\n<li>The third-party service collects your information for processing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the event of a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we would have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your information to a third party \u2014 such as an acquiring entity and its advisers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can preserve or share personal information if the law requires us to do so.\nWe can also preserve or share personal information if we believe it would be necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with the law or with legal process</li>\n<li>Protect and defend our rights and property</li>\n<li>Protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Times Services</li>\n<li>Protect the safety or property of our users or the general public (e.g., if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, we could share your information to help investigations into your actions)</li>\n<li>Cooperate with government authorities, which could be outside your country of residence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We disclose public activities in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats.\nYour public activities could thus appear on other websites, blogs or feeds.</li>\n</ol>Back to top4.What Are Your Rights?<p>\n<strong>A) How Do I Opt Out of Email, Phone, Mail and Push Notifications?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The opt-out methods described below are limited to the email address, phone or device used.\nThey won\u2019t affect subsequent

out any time by adjusting your device settings, or uninstalling our app.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Text Messages:</strong>\n<p>You can opt out of text alerts any time by replying \u201cSTOP,\u201d or

you have the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access, modify, or delete the personal information we have about you</li>\n<li>Receive an electronic copy of the personal information we have about you, for data portability</li>\n<li>Restrict, or object to, how we process personal information about you</li>\n<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of your privacy

you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., if you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you might not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of the purchase or promotion).</p>\n<p>In some cases, your request doesn\u2019t ensure complete removal of the content or information (e.g., if another user has reposted your

and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests.\n\u201cLegitimate interest\u201d also refers to our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that
