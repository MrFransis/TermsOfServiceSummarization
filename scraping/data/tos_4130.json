provide unbiased reporting about technology and cybersecurity issues.</p>\n<p>While disinformation and misinformation campaigns run rampant and copycat publishers abound, BleepingComputer takes pride in our investigative and original reporting regarding a wide variety of topics, including cybersecurity, operating systems, computers, software products, and privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To maintain our strict editorial independence and original reporting, BleepingComputer operates under the following guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While BleepingComputer generates its revenue from advertising, our partners do not have any influence on our writing.</li>\n<li>BleepingComputer does not sell links on our site or accept compensation to write articles about companies or their products.\nAny sponsored posts at BleepingComputer will be clearly marked so readers understand that this is paid content or content that we may earn a commission.</li>\n<li>BleepingComputer does not accept payment to conduct reviews or provide a favorable opinion.</li>\n<li>BleepingComputer is commonly provided embargoed research or \"tips\" but we refuse to accept them with preconditions regarding what is stated in the article.</li>\n<li>BleepingComputer protects the identity of our sources to the fullest extent of the law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more detailed information regarding these guidelines, you can read the following sections below.</p>\n<strong>Sources of information</strong>\n<p>BleepingComputer relies on different sources of information that we use to craft our articles.\nThese sources include end-users, employees, threat actors, corporate reports, research, press releases, and other publisher's stories.</p>\n<p>We also conduct interviews over the phone, messaging apps, emails, and through video conferencing.\nDuring phone and video interviews, we may record the conversation to report on the information provided properly.\nAll discussions are considered to be \"on the record\" unless we are told otherwise, in which case, we will honor that request.</p>\n<p>Due to the nature of our reporting on cybersecurity and cyberattacks, we also commonly use sources who wish to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals from employers&nbsp;or threat actors.\nWhen working with sources who wish to remain anonymous, BleepingComputer will always protect their identity to the fullest extent of the law.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regardless of how we attain our information, BleepingComputer will always independently confirm the accuracy of such information through our own tests, in conversations with the related companies, or through other individuals who have demonstrated that they have first-hand knowledge about the topic.</p>\nEditorial corrections and updates\n<p>Despite making the best efforts to report on a particular topic or news event accurately, we may sometimes get something wrong.</p>\n<p>If a mistake is reported to BleepingComputer or we discover it on our own, we will promptly update our content with a correction and provide a statement explaining why we made the change.</p>\n<p>While covering a story, there are times that the report may be developing and new information becomes available at a later date.\nWhen that occurs, we will update our content and note why BleepingComputer added additional content.</p>\n<strong>Conference and press event coverage</strong>\n<p>At times, BleepingComputer writers are invited to conferences to cover new information presented by companies and researchers.</p>\n<p>While we may attend these events, BleepingComputer&nbsp;does not promise to cover the topics or product information presented at said events.</p>\n<strong>Advertising and Sponsored Content</strong>\n<p>BleepingComputer uses advertising to cover the costs of operating the website and producing our content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Advertisers will never influence what and how we write about a particular topic or about products and services that we may cover in our content.</p>\n<p>BleepingComputer may at times utilize a native advertisement called advertorials, which is an advertisements in the form of editorial content.\nAll advertorial content will clearly be marked as sponsored content or deals and will always contain a disclaimer at the bottom so that readers can identify that there is a commercial incentive for the publishing of the content.</p>\n<p>Some of our content may contain marketing links, or affiliate links, that generate commissions from purchases made through those links.\nOur affiliate partnerships don't influence our editorial content and will only be recommended if they provide a tangible benefit to the visitor.\nVisitors can find more information on how BleepingComputer uses affiliate links in our 'Affiliate Disclosures'&nbsp;below.</p>\nProduct Reviews\n<p>When writing reviews on this site, BleepingComputer uses the following guidelines:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When reviewing products, the editors and team members will always provide honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on the products being reviewed.</li>\n<li>BleepingComputer never accepts compensation to write a review.</li>\n<li>When writing reviews, we sometimes purchase the product ourselves or are given the product by the company.\nIf we are given the product, it will be stated in the review.</li>\n<li>After a review is finished, we will return the item if requested.\nOtherwise, the reviewed item will be given away as a promotion on BleepingComputer.com.</li>\n<li>Advertisers on our site may also be a company who's&nbsp;product we are reviewing.\nTheir advertising, though, will have no bearing on how we review their product</li>\n</ol> Affiliate Disclosures\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission requires that we disclose any relationship between a product manufacturer or advertiser when we write about a product, service, or recommend a product.\nBleepingComputer agrees with this policy as it allows you, the reader, to understand the relationships between a site and the various companies and products they promote.</p>\n<p>We have outlined our product review standards and the various ways we use affiliate links or earn commissions:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Affiliate Links</strong>\n</p>\n<p>BleepingComputer may use links that generate a commission for the site if you use them to purchase a product.\nIn the forums, we use SkimLinks to automatically transform posted links into affiliate links.\nIf you do not wish to view inserted links, you can opt out of this process by going to this URL:&nbsp;http://optout.skimlinks.com/?tested=1.</p>\n<p>We may also utilize affiliate links for various products within our Virus Removal Guides, Download section, and Tutorials, and News articles.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Virus Removal Guides</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In our Virus Removal section, we offer guides on how to remove various computer infections.\nThese guides may use programs and utilities that generate commissions for the site when you purchase them.\nWe will never, though, promote a product for the sole purpose of generating a commission.</p>\n<p>We will only suggest a product that can actually help you remove the computer infection for free, and we will only receive a commission if you decide to purchase it after.\nIf it is required that you purchase a product before you can remove an infection, and we receive a commission for it, we will specifically state this in the guide.\nThe products that we routinely use in our guides and that we receive affiliate commissions from are MalwareBytes, Emsisoft, Zemana, and HitmanPro.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Download Section</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All of the programs in our&nbsp;Download&nbsp;section are fully functional and free to use.\nIf you use the product and decide to purchase it, we may earn a commission for the sale, depending on the software.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Tutorial Section</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some tutorials may discuss or require specific hardware or software that contain Amazon affiliate links that will generate a commission for the site if you purchase them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>StackCommerce and the BleepingComputer.com Deals Store</strong>\n</p>\n<p>BleepingComputer.com has partnered with StackCommerce to offer our readers deals on a variety of products.\nIf a user chooses to purchase a product through this store, BleepingComputer.com will earn a commission on the sale.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns&nbsp;regarding these policies, please free to contact us here:

Overview\n<p>\n<strong>BleepingComputer</strong>\u00ae&nbsp;is a news and support site with technology news, tutorials, tips, reviews, and support forums to receive help from volunteers.\nBleepingComputer was founded in 2004 by Lawrence Abrams and the site is located at the URL https://www.bleepingcomputer.com.\nWe are physically located in the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BleepingComputer</strong> is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its visitors and members.\nThis privacy policy (\"<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>\") is designed to inform you about the type of information that Bleeping Computer LLC (\"<strong>BleepingComputer</strong>\", \"<strong>we</strong>\" and \"<strong>us</strong>\" ) may gather or collect from you in connection with your use of this site (\"<strong>Website</strong>\", \"<strong>site</strong>\").\nIt also explains the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in

register for an account, you will be required to provide a display name and login name of your choice (we suggest that you do not use your real names), and an email address.\nThere are also fields for specifying your location, birthday, and gender, but these are optional.</p>\n<p>We also work with third-parties to display advertisements, social sharing links, article comments, affiliate marketing, and analytics.\nAll third party partners have assured BleepingComputer that they are working within the laws and guidelines of a BleepingComputer visitor's country.\nAll third party partners will be outlined later in this document.</p>\n<p>We are also committed to offering GDPR&nbsp;compliance, allowing our users to opt out of data collection, and to understand their rights.</p>\n<p>If at any time you wish to change your GDPR compliance, you can do so by clicking on the button below.</p>\n<p>\n</p>Change your data collection preferences&nbsp;<p>\n</p>\n<p>This policy will be updated from

of this Privacy Policy and retain a link to the previous policy.\nIt is advised that you periodically check this policy to see if anything has been changed.</p>\nRegistering an account at BleepingComputer\n<p>BleepingComputer provides the ability for visitors to register a free account so that they can make comments to news articles or make posts in the forums.\nWhen registering an account it is required to provide an email address, a login name, and a display name that is publicly visible.\nWhen selecting the Display Name, you should not use your real name unless you do not care if it is publicly displayed.</p>\n<p>In addition to this information, in order to register an account you will be required to validate your account's email address, agree to BleepingComputer's User Agreement, provide consent to this privacy policy, and agree to our Forum Rules.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that when you register an account, you agree to allow BleepingComputer to display your forum posts indefinitely.\nWe will be happy to remove any personal information or disassociate posts with an account at the request of the member.</p>\n<p>As a benefit of registering an account, you will no longer see advertisements on the site when you are logged in.</p>\nWhat data we collect and how we use it\n<p>When you use BleepingComputer, there is certain data that is automatically collected by our server and web site.\nAs previously stated, if you decide to register an account, additional data is also collected in order to create the account.\nThis data is necessary for the proper operation of the site and to provide the features you would expect from it.\nWe have described what data is collected by BleepingComputer below.</p>\nRegistration Information\n<p>When a user registers an account on the site to become a member, they must provide a login name, display name, and email address.\nWhen registering, their IP address at the time of the registration will be associated with the account for security purposes.\nThis IP address is not publicly displayed.</p>\n<p>Once registered, a member can optionally add their birthday, gender, location, and other information.\nThis information can be removed at any time.</p>\nForum Posts &amp.\nStatus Updates\n<p>A registered and logged in member may create new topics or reply to existing topics in the forums.\nWhen posting to the forums, their IP address is associated with the post for security reasons, such as the proper operation of spam filters and moderation tools.\nThis IP address is not publicly displayed.</p>\n<p>Any data that is posted to the site is completely up to the member and should be sanitized of all personal data.\nIf a member posts content that contains personal information by accident they can edit the post and remove the personal information themselves within 24 hours.\nOtherwise they need to contact us to edit the post and remove the personal information.</p>\n<p>Registered members also have the ability to post status updates in their user profiles.\nLike posts, what content is posted is up to the user.\nStatus replies can be removed by the member or they can contact us to have it removed.</p>\nImages, Documents, and Attachments\n<p>If you register an account and make a post in our forums, depending on the forum you may have the ability to upload images, data files, and text files.\nThis is completely optional and up to the member, but if a member does upload content, they should make sure to strip any personal information from it.\nMembers can manage their attachments and delete any that they wish.</p>\nContact Information\n<p>When registering an account or using the Contact Us form on the site, users may provide contact information such as their name, address, and email address.\nThis information is used only to contact the member as necessary and is never shared with third parties.</p>\n<p>Registered members have the ability to subscribe to articles, topics, or forums to receive notifications when new content has been posted to BleepingComputer.com.\nBleepingComputer will send these notifications to the email address associated with the account.\nUsers can disable these notifications at any time in their settings.</p>\n<p>From time to time, BleepingComputer may host contests that requires personal information to be submitted.\nThis information will only be shared as needed to enter the contest and send a prize if the member wins.</p>\nComments\n<p>We use a custom commenting system for some of our articles and Disqus for others.\nFor our custom commenting system, only registered and logged in users may post a comment.\nWhen doing so, they can edit their comment within 24 hours of its creation and must contact us afterwards to delete it.</p>\nEmbedded 3rd party content\n<p>BleepingComputer, and its users, may embed content such as images, Tweets, videos, and more from third-party sites into articles, forum posts, tutorials, and other user submitted content.\nWhen a visitor browses to a page that contains embedded content it will be retrieved from a third-party site.\nBleepingComputer has no control over what tracking and cookies these third-party sites may utilize.</p>\nAnalytics and Server Logs\n<p>When anyone, regardless of whether you are a member or guest, visits BleepingComputer, our server will automatically record the IP address of the user and save it to our server logs.\nThis is common practice for all web servers and we only use this information for security reasons or when required to legally.\nThese logs are only saved for 7 days.</p>\n<p>BleepingComputer also uses Google Analytics to provide anonymized and aggregated data about our visitors.\nThis allows us to see what content our visitors like the most, what sections get the most traffic, and allow us to provide the experience you expect to receive from BleepingComputer.com.\nIn order to anonymize the collection of data in Analytics, we have enabled the \"IP Anonymization\" feature and disabled the \"Remarketing\" and \"Advertising Reporting Features\" features.</p>\nCookies\n<p>We now get to the everyone's favorite snack, but biggest annoyance when it comes to browsing the web.\n</p>\n<p>When it comes to browser cookies, BleepingComputer
