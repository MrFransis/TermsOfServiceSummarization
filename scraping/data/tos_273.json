below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled.\nIn the event your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate.\nFor example, if you started your Sumo subscription or began paying on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date.\nYour renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription.\nVisit your website and access Sumo Store within your Sumo install and click on the Billing tab to see the commencement date for your next renewal period.\nWe may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges.\nAs used in these Terms of

page.\nFollowing any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.\nAt any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members.\nThe amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Payment Methods.&nbsp;You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting your website and accessing Sumo Store within your Sumo install and clicking on the Payments tab.\nIf a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, \"Cancellation\" below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated.\nThis may result in a change to your payment billing dates.\nFor certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges.\nCheck with your Payment Method service provider for details.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Cancellation.&nbsp;You may cancel your Sumo membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Sumo subscription service through the end of your
