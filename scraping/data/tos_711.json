contractual penalty to be determined by Honeypot\u2019s exercise of its reasonable discretion, subject to review by an independent court in Honeypot\u2019s residential country and should not be less than five times the financial loss caused through this unauthorized action with a minimum fee of 25,000 EUR.</li>\n<li>An obligation to reimburse damages will thereby not be excluded.</li>\n<li>In
