navigate to a specific location within the Service mobile app), we collect Personal Information and non-Personal Information (discussed above in Section 2) regarding that use.&nbsp.\nFor example, to improve our Services, we collect how, when, and which parts of the Services or its features you use, which social media platforms you connect to the Services, and when, how, and what you post to the social media platforms through the Service app.&nbsp.\nAlso, we may use your device\u2019s unique identifier (UDID) or other unique identifiers to assist us in collecting and analyzing this data.</p>\n<p>To assist us in collecting and storing this non-Personal Information, we may employ a variety of technologies, including \u201cCookies,\u201d local browser storage, and \u201cweb beacons,\u201d \u201cpixels,\u201d or \u201ctags.\u201d&nbsp.\nA \u201cCookie\u201d is a small amount of data a website operator, or a third party whose content is embedded in that website, may store in your web browser and that the website operator or, as applicable, the third party, can access when you visit the website.\nA web beacon, pixel or tag is a small, usually-transparent image placed on a web page that allows the operator of that image, which may be the operator of the website you visit or a third party, to read or write a Cookie.</p>\n<p>Your operating system and web browser may allow you to erase information stored in Cookies, and local browser storage.\nBut if you do so, you may be forced to login to the Services again and you may lose some preferences or settings.&nbsp.\nYou may also be able to set your browser to refuse all website storage or to indicate when it is permitted, but some features of our Services may not function properly without it.&nbsp.\nWe may use Cookies to keep you logged in, save your preferences for the Services, and to collect information about how you use our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More information about managing Cookies is available here.\nTo learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for your local browser storage, please refer to the end user documentation for your browser.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An Online Tool Provider may collect information automatically, in which case Personal Information and non-Personal Information it receives are subject to the Online Tool Provider\u2019s privacy policy.&nbsp.\nSome Online Tool Providers may allow you to opt out of certain collection and/or uses of your information.&nbsp.\nYou can read more here: Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nTransparency and Choice.\nDo Not Track Signals</b>\n</p>\n<p>You may request access to your Personal Information by sending an email to info@activeminds.org.\nWe will try to locate and provide you with your Personal Information and give you the opportunity to correct this data, if it is inaccurate, or to delete it, at your request.\n&nbsp.\nBut, in either case, we may need to retain it for legal reasons or for legitimate business purposes.\nYou may also remove any content that you post to the Services using the deletion or removal options within the Service.&nbsp.\nHowever, we (and you) are not able to control information that you have already shared with other users or made available to third parties through the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you need further assistance with removing any content you posted through the Services, you can email us at info@activeminds.org.\nRemoval of your posted content may not ensure complete or comprehensive removal from our computer systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups), or relate to information that is not associated with your Personal Information.&nbsp.\nIn any case, where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please be aware that if you ask us to delete your Personal Information, you may not be able to continue to use the Services.&nbsp.\nAlso, even if you request that we delete your Personal Information, we may need to retain certain information for a limited period of time to satisfy our legal, audit and/or dispute resolution requirements.</p>\n<p>We may use third-party service providers that collect information for interest-based advertising purposes (advertisements that are tailored to your likely interests, based on categories in which you have shown an interest).&nbsp.\nTo learn more about these third parties and the choices they offer users, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s choices page or the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s choices page.&nbsp.\nIf you are reading this Privacy Policy from a mobile device, you can learn more about the DAA\u2019s mobile choices program here.&nbsp.\nYou may also change your Google and Facebook advertising settings visiting their respective settings pages.</p>\n<p>We support the development and implementation of a standard \u201cdo not track\u201d browser feature that provides customers with control over the collection and use of information about their web-browsing activities.\nOnce a standardized \u201cdo not track\u201d feature is released, we intend to adhere to the browser settings accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can opt out of receiving marketing e-mails from us by clicking on the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link in the e-mails.&nbsp.\nPlease note that it may take up to ten (10) business days for your opt-out request to be processed.&nbsp.\nAlso, even if you opt out of marketing e-mails, we may continue to send you certain account-related e-mails, such as notices about your account and confirmations of transactions you have requested.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\nResidents of California, Nevada, or Canada&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>Residents of California</p>\n<p>You may have heard of the California Consumer Privacy Act which provides certain rights to California (CCPA) residents in connection with their Personal Information.&nbsp.\nOur Services are not currently subject to the CCPA.&nbsp.\nHowever, we do provide notice and transparency about our collection and use of Personal Information as described in Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Residents of Canada</p>\n<p>If you have an objection to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy, you may file a complaint by sending an email to info@activeminds.org.&nbsp.\nWe will attempt to accommodate your objection or complaint, but you understand that, to the extent you object to our processing of Personal Information that is necessary for us to provide the Services to you, certain features and functionalities of the Services may no longer be available to you.&nbsp.\nNothing in this Privacy Policy prejudices your rights to file a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, and/or with any other applicable data protection authorities.</p>\n<p>Residents of Nevada</p>\n<p>We do not sell your Personal Information.&nbsp.\nHowever, you may contact us at info@activeminds.org with

under 13 years of age.&nbsp.\nWe do not authorize users under 13 years of age to use the Services.\nIf you are the parent or guardian&nbsp;and have learned or suspect that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Information, please contact at info@activeminds.org and provide us with the name and email address that was used and we will promptly delete such information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.\nInformation Security</b>\n</p>\n<p>We utilize reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information against unauthorized access, modification, or destruction.&nbsp.\nFor example, we utilize Secure Socket Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), or similar encryption technology when sensitive data is transmitted over the Internet, and use firewalls to help prevent external access into our network.&nbsp.\nHowever, no data transmission over the Internet and no method of data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security.</p>\n<p>We restrict access to Personal Information in our possession to our employees, Service Providers, and Online Tool Providers who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, improve or support our Services.\nIf we share Personal Information with Service Providers or Online Tool Providers, we require that they also use reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>10.\nThird Party Websites&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that the Services may link or integrate with third-party sites, services or

policies and terms of service of those third parties so that you understand how those websites collect, use, share and protect your information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.\nChanges to this Policy</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may modify or update this Privacy Policy periodically with or without prior notice by posting the updated policy on this page.\nYou can always check the \u201cLast
