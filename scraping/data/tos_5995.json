Use:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These General Conditions of Use determine the use of all the Sites with the exception of ARTE Boutique, ARTE Magazine, ARTE Radio, ARTE Studio, ARTE Sales, ARTE Pro and EDUC\u2019ARTE, which are subject to different conditions of use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Accepting the General Conditions of Use:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Consultation of the Sites and use of the Content, as well as use of the Player and/or its \u201cEmbed\u201d and \u201cShare\u201d functions, whether on or off the Sites, as well as use of the \u201cMy ARTE\u201d service, are governed by these General Conditions of Use.</p>\n<p>The applicable version of the General Conditions of Use is the version in force during each consultation of the Sites and/or use of the Content and services by the User.</p>\n<p>ARTE will notify Users that have signed up to \u201cMy ARTE\u201d of any modifications of functionalities linked to the \u201cMy ARTE\u201d service or these General Conditions of Use (<em>via</em> ARTE\u2019s website and <em>via</em> an e-mail sent to the e-mail address given by the User at the time of the registration on \u00ab My ARTE \u00bb).\nUsers that do not have a \u201cMy ARTE\u201d account will not be notified in advance should the General Conditions of Use be updated in any way.\nUsers are therefore advised to consult the General Conditions of Use regularly so as to be aware of any amendments made thereto and of the version in force at the time of consultation of the Sites and/or use of the Content and services on offer.</p>\n<p>In the event that the User is a minor, those with parental authority are responsible for ensuring compliance by the User with these General Conditions of Use.\nThey are legally bound to monitor their child\u2019s use of the Content made available by ARTE.</p>\n<p>ARTE reserves the right to make a claim against the User in the event of breach of these General Conditions of Use by the User.</p>\n<p>Each point of these General Conditions of Use is valid separately and shall remain valid and applicable independently of the others.\nThe invalidity of any provision or part of these General Conditions of Use will not affect the validity of the other provisions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 1 \u2013 PURPOSE OF THE SITES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Among other things, the sites allow the User:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to consult information relating to the channel, its mission, its programmes and their broadcast</li>\n<li>to view some of the channel\u2019s programmes Live and/or on demand</li>\n<li>to consult pages relating to the channel\u2019s programmes and that are the extension of its activity onto the Internet</li>\n<li>to share certain links by e-mail, on social networks or other sites</li>\n<li>to post comments on the participation areas of the Sites</li>\n<li>to create a \u201cMy ARTE\u201d profile in order to see the Videos partially or entirely watched and to create a personalised list of Videos</li>\n<li>to take part in games subject to particular rules</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 2 \u2013 ACCESS TO THE SITES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ARTE grants the User an unrestricted and non-exclusive right of access to all the Sites for the purpose of individual consultation or consultation strictly in the context of the family circle.\nThis right of access allows the User to consult the Sites and to use the Content in the context of these General Conditions of Use.</p>\n<p>However, certain services offered on the Sites require the User to register.\nfor example, the publication of comments on the participation areas (see Article 5 below) and the use of \u201cMy ARTE\u201d accounts.</p>\n<p>ARTE is not subject to any performance obligation with regard to the functioning of the Sites and the availability of the Content.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the User expressly acknowledges that ARTE may at any time block access to all or part of the Sites or of the Content, particularly by reason of constraints or limitations of a technical or legal nature, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 3 \u2013 USE OF THE SITES</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Sites and the Content are protected by intellectual property rights, and in particular by copyright and trademark law.</p>\n<p>The right of access granted to the User (see Article 2) does not include any authorisation to reproduce or represent the Sites or the Content.\nAccordingly, any reproduction or representation of all or part of the Sites or of the Content, other than in the exceptional legal cases provided by the Intellectual Property Code, without ARTE\u2019s prior written consent, will constitute an act of counterfeiting and may be the subject of a claim in the competent courts.</p>\n<p>Users therefore agree, subject to civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance, not to reproduce or arrange to reproduce, not to represent or arrange to represent, or adapt, amend, transfer, market, distribute or imitate all or part of the Sites or the Content.</p>\n<p>Users accept that ARTE has exclusive editorial control of the Sites and the Content.\nThey expressly acknowledge that ARTE may at any time amend or delete all or part of the Sites or of the Content, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>\n<p>The Sites may contain links to other sites or services published by third parties in relation to the Content.\nARTE endeavours only to offer the User links to sites or services that are free from anomalies, errors or bugs, but it cannot guarantee that their use will not pose any risk to the User.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the use of sites or services published by third parties is excluded from the scope of these General Conditions of Use and shall take place subject to the conditions of use specific to those sites.</p>\n<p>The Sites may contain Content that is not appropriate for minors.\nPersons with parental authority must be aware of this and monitor the use of the Sites by minors under their supervision.</p>\n<p>In this context, if a programme is likely to be unsuitable for a young audience, ARTE may warn the User of that programme\u2019s sensitive nature and/or arrange for it to be available on demand between 11pm and 5am only.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ARTICLE 4 \u2013 USE OF THE PLAYER</strong>\n</p>\n<p>ARTE has developed an exportable Player that allows the User to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>view the channel\u2019s Live broadcasts and the Videos published by ARTE and to choose between the various language versions available</li>\n<li>share certain Videos off the Sites using the \u201cEmbed\u201d function</li>\n<li>share part of the Content by e-mail or on social networks using the \u201cShare\u201d function</li>\n<li>temporarily download Videos via the ARTE application</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For contractual reasons, ARTE is likely to geolocate access to the Live broadcasts and/or Videos in order to restrict their viewing from certain countries.\nBypassing, deactivating or altering the conditions of access is expressly prohibited.\nFor more information on this point, <u>consult the FAQ</u>.</p>\n<p>The Player is protected by copyright as software and must be used in the form supplied by ARTE.\nAny modification, adaptation, deletion, decompilation or reverse engineering of the Player, its functionalities or its appearance is expressly prohibited without the prior authorisation of ARTE in writing.\nThe Player may also carry \u201cpre-rolls\u201d, short advertising or promotional messages broadcast before the start of the Videos.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the contractual provisions agreed with the rights holders, normal use of the Player as authorised by these General Conditions of Use allows the User to view the Live broadcasts and the Videos without the ability to save them permanently.\nOnly a temporary download via the ARTE application is authorised for certain content.\nUnless stated to the contrary, final and permanent downloading of the Videos offered by means of the Player is not allowed.</p>\n<p>Consequently, any saving, regardless of the process or medium used for that purpose, of all or part of the Live broadcasts and/or of the Videos, which is not within the scope of a legal exception provided by the intellectual Property Code, is expressly prohibited without ARTE\u2019s prior authorisation in writing.</p>\n<p>In the same way, Users are reminded that editing or making available or communicating to the public any software, application, site, etc., that allows the normal use of the Player to be bypassed, particularly in order to definitively and permanently download all or part of the Direct broadcasts and/or of the Videos, is not allowed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.1 Use of the \u201cShare\u201d function</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The \u201cShare\u201d function allows the User to share links to the pages of the Sites containing Videos by e-mail or on social networks.\nUsers simply have to copy the link generated by the Player and paste it in the e-mail or on the intended site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 Use of the \u201cEmbed\u201d function</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The \u201cEmbed\u201d function allows Users to export certain Videos offered by means of the Player off the Sites.\nIn order to do this, Users must only use the embed code generated by the Player.\nAny embedding of one or more Videos using another process (framing, etc.) is expressly prohibited.</p>\n<p>For contractual reasons, ARTE is likely to geolocate access to the Videos in order to restrict their viewing from certain countries.\nThus, only Users with

service</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users can create personalised accounts, i.e.\nUser profiles, on the ARTE Site.\nThese allow them to add Videos to their favourites, see which Videos they have already watched, subscribe to programmes, take part in competitions and to subscribe to different newsletters.</p>\n<p>Using the \u201cMy ARTE\u201d service is reserved for Users who are at least 18 years old and have legal capacity.\nThose with parental authority are responsible for any use of their accounts carried out by their children.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2 Access to the \u201cMy ARTE\u201d service</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Account creation and management is carried out by way of the Single Sign\u2011on system (hereinafter referred to as SSO).\nIt is used on arte.tv and on the ARTE Android and IOS applications, as well as ARTE HbbTV applications.\nThis system allows ARTE to recognise the User on all its digital offers.\nUsers can then log in to his profile without having to sign up again.\nIt can also be used to facilitate any potential user age checks put in place in order to protect younger audiences.\nBy providing Users with unique logins, the SSO automatically uses their personal data.\nWhen Users sign up to the ARTE SSO, they agree to the use of their personal data as detailed below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3 Contests</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Users can participate in contests through their \u201cMy ARTE\u201d account.\nParticipating in competitions is subject to the prior acceptance of the contest rules, which are available on the contest registration website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4 \u201cMy ARTE\u201d and personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Single Sign\u2011on system (SSO) uses various authentication cookies that help to recognise the User\u2019s browser within the limits set by ARTE Sites.\nThey are also used to identify the User, which means the User does not have to sign up several times to the ARTE portal.<br>\nWhen the User signs out, the \u201cStandard Authentication Cookie\u201d is deleted from the SSO.\nAnother authentication cookie is saved on the User\u2019s computer for a period of time independent of the duration of his sessions.\nIt enables the User to stay connected without having to sign in at the beginning of each session (staying active until the User signs out manually).<br>\nThese cookies are deleted at the end of the User\u2019s session.</p>\n<p>For more information about the cookies used on ARTE pages, see the \u201c<u>ARTE and cookies</u>\u201d section.</p>\n<p>When Users sign up to the SSO, ARTE collects the following personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<u>identification data</u> when Users fill in the central sign\u2011up form: their email address (mandatory)</li>\n<li>\n<u>Metadata</u>: when a User creates an account, certain data (metadata) are retrieved to describe their account.\nThese metadata are essential for the service to work (for example: password, date account was created, IP address used when account was created, date of last login with SSO, date personal data were last modified, etc.) <u>data linked to features of the personal page: </u>usage data (favourites, previously\u2011watched content, etc.),</li>\n<li>\n<u>Personal Data for some one\u2011off actions</u> (e.g.\ndate of birth or postal address in the case of a competition)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Email addresses are used for identification purposes and to obtain dual confirmation of registration.\nthe dual confirmation of registration is done by clicking on an authentication hyperlink sent by email to the User\u2019s email address (double opt\u2011in system) or to communicate the User\u2019s password to them if it is lost.</p>\n<p>ARTE uses the data collected via the SSO to know which Content Users look at and to assess them using statistics.</p>\n<p>This information helps us to know which pages of the Site are particularly popular, when services are most used and which browser versions or operating systems are used.</p>\n<p>ARTE can also find out if Users open the Newsletter and which of its links they click on.</p>\n<p>This data is retained within the European Union on a secure platform provided by the service provider Login Radius.</p>\n<p>User identification data is not transferred to third parties, except:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it proves necessary for the proper functioning of ARTE\u2019s services.</li>\n<li>If ARTE is required to do so by law or as a result of a court order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless otherwise requested by the User, data is retained for three years following his/her last login.\nIf a User has still not logged in after three years, he/she will receive an email inviting them to do so as soon as possible.\nIf they do not do so, their data will be deleted from the ARTE database.</p>\n<p>ARTE puts in place technical and organisational security measures to ensure its Users\u2019 personal data is protected against loss, fraudulent alterations and unauthorised access by third parties.\nFurthermore, only those with authorisation within ARTE are able to access personal data, and only in situations when it is necessary.\nData collected when the User signs up is transferred encrypted, as is all subsequent communication between the SSO servers and the ARTE portal.</p>\n<p>Users can modify some of their information by going to the \u201cMy ARTE

send them the Newsletter and any communications relating to their registration.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Metadata</u>: creation of an account requires the collection of certain data (metadata) describing the

information as to whether the User has opened the Newsletter, information as to when the Newsletter was opened and information on the User\u2019s browser.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These data are kept in the
