enforcement and government agencies who make requests for information about what you were doing through a VPN connection.</code>\n</p>\n<p>Data needed for the provision of our Services.\nWe use a random identifier, which we generate for you, and a signed token that is held by your device.\nThis limited technical data sometimes could be regarded as personal data.\nWe may ask you to verify your

functioning of our Services, and to improve the application itself.</li>\n<li>Basic device data.\nSuch as device type, model, brand name (e.g.\nSamsung, Apple), OS version, device ID, language, time

their cookie settings.</li>\n<li>For self-protection purposes We may keep access logs as well (for example, browser type, operating system, etc.).\nWe use them in order to ensure information security since they help protect ourselves from cyber threats (such as DDoS attacks, scanning, etc.).</li>\n<li>Social media widgets.\nWe have a legitimate interest to be known on the market, thus, our Website may have social media features in order to make it easier for you to share information about us.\nThese features may mean that a cookie is set and some information, such as your IP address or which

third-party service providers and as needed for legal purposes.</p>\n<p>We do comply with the laws of the USA, but, in any case, we have very little data to share with anyone because of our no-logs
