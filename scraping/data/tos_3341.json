they are inconsistent.</p>\n<p>Our right to process personal data also is described in our agreements (\"<strong>Customer Agreements</strong>\") with our business customers (\"<strong>Customers</strong>\").\nIn our Customer Agreements, Acronis is typically contractually prohibited from accessing the personal data that Customers store and otherwise process through

Services.</p>2.\nDATA CONTROLLER<p>The data controller (i.e., the person who or entity that determines the purpose and means of processing) for the personal data collected pursuant to this Privacy

collect information about which features you use and how you use them, including: date/time stamps associated with purchase, installation, updates and your usage.\nintegrations.\nhow often you use the Services and in which circumstances.\nServices performance metrics.\nfeatures you use and the results of their operations.\ninformation about disabled features.\nand information about errors and crashes and activities which led to them.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Service operation information</em>: Depending on the Services you use, we collect information that is necessary to provide such Services and that forms an integral part of such Services.\nFor example, we collect the list of software installed on your machine, together with version and manufacturer information as part of providing you vulnerability assessment and patch management functionality of certain Services.\nAs another example, we collect information about names of potentially malicious files together with their hashes and full paths to such files or blocked website URLs as part of providing you antivirus and URL filtering functionality of certain Services.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Device information</em>: We collect information

Chrome browser, which captures your voice via your microphone and transfers it to Google for recognition.\nAs a result, we receive only a text version of your voice commands, which we do not keep and use only for current command execution.\nSince your voice data is processed by Google, the purposes and the ways that Google processes your data may vary depending on your Google account settings (if any) and preferences.\nTo understand how Google processes your data, including voice data, please carefully read the Google privacy policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Acronis Customer Experience Program</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Acronis collects certain information through the Acronis Customer Experience Program

pseudonymized Usage Data to improve Acronis products and services.\nAcronis achieves the pseudonymization by associating such data with a randomly generated number (pseudonym) instead of the personal ID associated with your Acronis account.\nAcronis cannot identify you by the pseudonym without you providing additional information to Acronis for identification purposes.</p>\n<p>If you consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP, Acronis will connect your personal data to your CEP Usage Data.\nThe personal data Acronis connects to your CEP Usage Data is limited to your Acronis account ID and account information.\nAs in this case Acronis links personal data and Usage Data, Acronis treats the CEP Usage Data linked to your personal data as personal data.\nYour consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP allows Acronis to provide you more specific feedback and guidance about Acronis products, services, and features operation.\nYou can consent to Acronis processing your personal data as part of CEP by checking the corresponding box in the product settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected through Data Collection

to recognize and count the number of visitors to our website, to learn how users navigate the Services and to help us to improve how the Services function.</li>\n<li>We also use Google Analytics,

available in your region, or directly in your browser.\nMost browsers allow viewing, managing, deleting or blocking cookies.\nPlease be aware that if you delete or block cookies directly in your browser then some of your preferences can be lost, as well as some functionality may no longer be available, including the ability to opt-out and mange cookies via the Privacy Preference center as this function itself uses cookie for keeping your preferences.</p>\n<p>You may find the guidelines on how to control cookies for common browsers at the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>MacOS Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Statement On Do Not Track Signals</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a \"Do Not Track\" (\"<strong>DNT</strong>\") or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain personal data about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option, and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many website operators, including Acronis, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>7.\nHOW WE PROCESS PERSONAL DATA<p>Acronis processes personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To set up and maintain your account;</li>\n<li>To provide the products and services that you
