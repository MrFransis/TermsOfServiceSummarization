fiduciary relationship is intended or created by the operation of the Artspace Auctions.\nArtspace may, but is not obligated to provide intermediary services between the buyer and sellers using Artspace Auctions.\nArtspace reserves the right in its sole discretion and at any time including during an auction to refuse or revoke permission for sellers to offer goods or for buyers to submit bids.\n</p>How bidding works<p> All bids shall be in United States Dollars.\nParticipating sellers and buyers may be required to register on the site, may select a username and password, and must agree to be bound by these terms.\nBuyers must register a valid credit card with Artspace and agree to pay a buyer\u2019s premium to Artspace which shall be added to the successful bid price.\nThe buyer\u2019s premium shall be equal 15% of the successful bid price for bids on some auction items.\nThe successful bidder shall pay the purchase price plus the buyer\u2019s premium as the final purchase price.\nThe agreements between the buyers and sellers shall not be governed by the U.N.\nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.\n</p>\n<p> Bids are submitted by clicking the \u201cbid\u201d button on the site.\nall bids are final and cannot be amended or retracted once submitted.\nAll bids will be recorded by Artspace and such recording shall constitute the final and conclusive determination and record of each bid and the highest bid.\n</p>Seller's reserve price<p>Sellers may set a minimum price for an auction item (\u201cReserve Price\u201d).\nA Seller is not required to accept any bids for less than the Reserve Price.\nIf bids are placed below the seller\u2019s Reserve Price, the bidder will be notified that the bid is below the Reserve Price.\n</p>Artspace bidding<p>Artspace may, through employees, submit bids on auction items that are subject to a Reserve Price.\nArtspace may (1) submit the opening bid on behalf of the seller at the Reserve Price, (2) place single or successive bids on behalf of the seller in response to other bids that are below the Reserve Price.\nIn no circumstances will Artspace place a bid that is above the Reserve Price.\n</p>Place your bid<p> Enter any bid amount as long as it is greater than or equal to the \"Next Minimum Bid\" (displayed below the bid field) and click on \"Place Bid\".\nThis will automatically place a straight bid at the next increment and hold the bid you submitted (if higher than the \"Next Minimum Bid\") as your \"Maximum Bid\".\nYou will receive an email confirmation of your bid and will be notified by email when you are outbid.\n</p>\n<p> By placing a bid each buyer irrevocable authorizes Artspace to immediately charge Buyer\u2019s registered credit card an amount equal to the buyer\u2019s premium.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> Please note that if the auction moves to a physical live event (the auction page will specify this and the bidder will be noticed as such by email), the highest bidder after the close of the online auction will be the opening bid at the event and will be notified within 48 hours after the event if the bid is the final winning bid or been outbid by someone at the event.\n</p>Bidding Increments<p> When placing a bid, enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the work.\nEntering your \"Maximum Bid\" does not necessarily mean you will pay that price, you may pay less.\nThe Auction system will Proxy Bid on your behalf up to the amount of your Maximum Bid.\nOnce you enter your Maximum Bid, your current bid displayed will be in the amount of the \"Next Minimum Bid.\" As the auction proceeds, Artspace will compare your bid to those of other bidders.\nWhen you are outbid, the system automatically bids on your behalf according to the bidding increments established for that auction up to (but never exceeding) your maximum bid.\nWe increase your bid by increments only as much as necessary to maintain your position as highest bidder.\nYour maximum bid is kept confidential until it is exceeded by another bidder.\nIf your maximum bid is outbid, you will be notified via email so that you can place another bid.\n</p>\n<p> If the auction is a benefit auction or an auction with a physical event (which will be noted on the auction page), all online bids will be transferred to that event and Artspace or the organization running the event will continue to monitor your bids in person and continue Proxy Bidding on your behalf up to your maximum bid.\nWinning bidders will be notified within 48 hours after the close of the auction.\nIf you are not contacted by Artspace, you were not the highest bidder.\n</p>Closing the Auction<p> Upon the close of each auction Artspace shall separately confirm the highest bid to the seller and notify the buyer submitting the highest bid that the bid was successful and the amount of the buyer\u2019s premium due to Artspace to be charged to buyer\u2019s credit card.\nArtspace shall thereupon charge buyer\u2019s credit card in the amount of the buyer\u2019s premium.\n</p>\n<p> Upon receipt of the buyer\u2019s premium Artspace shall email both the successful buyer and seller and shall provide each with the name, address, telephone number and email address of the other.\nbuyer and seller are thereafter solely responsible for arranging for the transmission of payment of the purchase price within 24 hours of the transmission of the Artspace email and for prompt shipment of the goods after receipt of good funds.\nIf for any reason after Artspace\u2019s initial confirmation of the successful bid the buyer cancels the transaction or fails to make payment to the seller, the buyer shall remain liable to Artspace for the full buyer\u2019s premium and Artspace reserves the right to retain such buyer\u2019s premium in addition to any other remedies it has at law or equity.\n</p>\n<p>
