below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.\n</b>Some web browsers may transmit \u201cdo-not-track\u201d signals to the websites with which the user communicates.\nBecause of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.\nBecause there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals.\nWe do however respond to the Global Privacy Control signal for California residents, as described further in the <b>\n<i>Privacy Information for California

cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website.\nCookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites.\nCookies serve many useful purposes.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.</li>\n<li>Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages.\nBy studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.</li>\n<li>Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don\u2019t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent.\nIf you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.\nIf you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Beacons.</b> We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or \u201cpixels\u201d) that communicate information from your device to a server.\nBeacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device.\nWe and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Local Storage &amp.\nOther Tracking Technologies.\n</b>We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as \u201cFlash cookies\u201d) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services.\nWe also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers.\nThese technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences.\nHowever, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.\nFor HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser.\nFor Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising</i>\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you.\nFor example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements.\nYou can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.</p>\n<p>In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .</p>\n<p>Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps.\nMany mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device.\nFor more information, please check your mobile settings.\nYou also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.</p>\n<p>Please visit our
