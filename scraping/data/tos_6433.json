Copyright\nCreative Commons License:\n<p>\n<br>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>SS64 Interpretation of \u201cNon-commercial\u201d</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Non-commercial use</i> means that users may not sell, profit from, or commercialize SS64 materials or works derived from them.\nThe guidelines below are intended to help users determine whether or not their use of SS64 materials would be permitted by SS64 under the \"non-commercial\" restriction.\nNote that there are additional requirements (attribution and share alike) spelled out in our license.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Commercialization is prohibited.</b> Users may <i>not</i> directly sell or profit from SS64 materials or from works derived from SS64 materials.<br>\n<br>Example: A commercial education or training business may not offer courses based on SS64 materials if students pay a fee for those courses and the business intends to profit as a result.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Determination of commercial vs.\nnon-commercial purpose is based on the use, <i>not</i> the user.</b> Materials may be used by individuals, institutions, governments, corporations, or other business whether for-profit or non-profit so long as the use itself is not a commercialization of the materials or a use that is directly intended to generate sales or profit.<br>\n<br>Example: A corporation may use SS64 materials for internal professional development and training purposes.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Incidental charges to recover reasonable reproduction costs may be permitted.</b> Recovery of nominal actual costs for copying small amounts (under 1000 copies) of SS64 content on paper or CDs is allowed for educational purposes so long as there is no profit motive and so long as the intended use of the copies is in compliance with all license terms.\nStudents must be informed that the materials are freely available on the SS64 Web site and that their purchase of copied materials is optional.<br>\n<br>Example: An institution in a remote area has limited Internet access and limited network infrastructure on campus, and a professor offers to create CDs of SS64 materials relevant to her course.\nThe professor may recover the costs of creating the CDs.</li>\n</ol> Attribution\n<blockquote>\n<p>For short extracts use the

have done which works well (and stays up-to-date) is to save the main command list (in any web browser - File, Save as) that gives you an HTML page with all the links back to ss64.com.\nYou can then
