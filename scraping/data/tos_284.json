can list the Parking Space for <i>Instant Bookings</i> or you can list your Parking Space for <i>Booking by Agreement</i>.</li>\n<li>Instant Booking<ol>\n<li>You may make your Parking Space available for instant booking.\nWhere you elect to use instant booking your Parking Space <strong>will be treated as available unless you inform us otherwise</strong>.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that you inform us of any dates your Parking Space will not be available for booking.\nIf the availability changes at any time you must notify us as soon as practicable.\nBased on the availability information you have provided to us we will tailor the Website listing for your Parking Space.\n<strong>If you have not informed us that your Parking Space is unavailable for a particular date or time then you may be liable to pay the reasonable costs of alternative arrangements for a Driver who makes a booking for such date and time (up to a maximum of \u00a3250).\nWhere this happens we may either deduct money directly from your JustPark account or pay the reasonable costs of alternative arrangements to a Driver ourselves and recover this money from you afterwards.\n</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Where instant booking is used, you agree that we will manage the entire booking process and you authorise us to accept a booking for an available date <strong>without further reference to you</strong>.\nWe will take payment from the Driver on your behalf at the time of Booking as set out below.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Booking by Agreement<ol>\n<li>If you have a Parking Space where booking is by agreement then the Website will allow Drivers to enquire about the availability of your Parking Space (each an \u201cEnquiry\u201d).\nAny Enquiries about prospective bookings will be sent to you automatically by email and/or by text message depending on the preferences as set out in your Account.\nEach Enquiry will include (where the information is available) the proposed date(s) or periods of the booking.\nYou agree to confirm with us as soon as practicable whether or not the booking is accepted.\nYou can confirm a booking by signing into the Website and approving the relevant Enquiry or by sending a text message to us if you have chosen to accept SMS notifications.</li>\n<li>Parking Space Owners have 72 hours to reply to an Enquiry before it lapses.\nYou acknowledge that during and after this 72 hour period after the Enquiry is sent by the Driver, we may suggest alternative Parking Spaces to the Driver who has made the Enquiry.</li>\n<li>If the booking is accepted by you, we will notify the Driver who can then book the Parking Space for the agreed times.\nUpon the Driver confirming the Booking (and making payment in accordance with 4iv below) you will enter into an agreement with the Driver.\nWe will provide the Driver with the contact details you have supplied to us without further reference to you, and we will take payment from the Driver on your behalf at the time of Booking as set out below.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Payment<ol>\n<li>Once a Booking has been accepted in accordance with this clause 4 we will request payment from the Driver.\nOnce we have received the necessary payment from the Driver, you will have entered into a binding agreement with the Driver to allow the Driver to occupy the Parking Space during the Booking Period (as set out in our email confirming a booking (\"Confirmation Email\")).\nWe will confirm a Booking to you as soon as practicable.</li>\n<li>JustPark Payments<ol>\n<li>For short and medium-term use (any Booking Period of 6 weeks or less) when we request payment from a Driver we will request the full amount due in respect of the Booking at the time of booking.</li>\n<li>For long-term use (any Booking Period of more than 6 weeks) we will require that the Driver pays for the first month of the Booking Period at the time of booking.\nWe will collect each subsequent month's payment in advance on the same day of the month for each subsequent month (or the remaining amount due for the Booking Period where less than a month is left) until the Booking Period is complete.</li>\n<li>You authorize us to accept and hold such payments on your behalf.\nWe will forward the initial payment received from the Driver to you, within 48 hours after the start of the Booking Period or within 48 hours after the period covered by a subsequent payment in the case of a long-term booking.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The Parking Space and Licence for the Booking Period<ol>\n<li>Before any Booking Period you must ensure that the Parking Space is in a satisfactory condition and complies with the information given in your listing.</li>\n<li>Unless you have agreed to the Driver being given a later departure time or further Booking Period (which must be agreed through the JustPark Services), if a Driver stays longer than the Booking Period, the Driver will be liable to pay the full price for any additional time stayed.\nIf a Driver does stay for such an additional period you authorise JustPark to collect payment of any such additional fees from Driver on your behalf.</li>\n<li>You represent and confirm that you own the Parking Space or are authorised to allow third parties to use the Parking Space (including having the necessary permission from any relevant landlords, tenant, condominium association and / or other third parties to offer the Parking Space for use by Drivers) and that the licence for the Driver to use the Parking Space during the Booking Period will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations that may apply to the Parking Space, including but not limited to parking laws, tax requirements and laws governing rental of or licenses to use residential and

you are able to grant a licence to use the Parking Space.</li>\n<li>You agree to notify us immediately (and provide copies where requested) upon receiving any notice, or correspondence from any

Services.\nFollowing such notice we reserve the right to terminate this Agreement and remove the Parking Space from the Website.</li>\n<li>We will not be liable to you, the Driver or any other third if you do not have the necessary authority referred to in clause 5 iii.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Complaints and Disputes<ol>\n<li>You agree that if you have any dispute with a Driver concerning your Parking Space or any use of the Parking Space you will attempt to resolve it in the first instance by directly communicating with the Driver.</li>\n<li>In the event that a dispute cannot be resolved with the Driver directly, you may refer the dispute to us or make a complaint.\nSimilarly, a Driver may refer a dispute to us.\nWe are under no obligation to resolve any disputes between you and a Driver.\nHowever, we may seek to resolve the dispute between you and a Driver and we may require that a Driver makes further payment to you.\nOr we may require that you refund payments you have received from the relevant Booking.</li>\n<li>You agree that if we determine that you should make a refund or other payment to a Driver, you will be responsible for these amounts and we may use any funds we are holding on your behalf in order to settle a dispute, deduct such funds from the debit or credit card you have supplied to us or JustPark may settle the amount owed to the Driver directly with the Driver and then seek the funds from you.</li>\n<li>You agree that the provisions in this clause will survive any termination of this Agreement.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Cancellation <ol>\n<li>If you want to cancel a Booking you must do so through the cancellation policy (<strong>www.justpark.com/cancellation-policy/</strong>) which may be updated from time to time (\"Cancellation

payments in respect of a booking before a Booking Period begins and such booking is subsequently cancelled by you or the Driver, you authorise us to refund the Driver from any payments we are holding

this agreement if you do not refund a Driver within the timeframes specified in the Cancellation Policy.\nYou agree that you will be responsible for such refunds and that we may use any funds we are holding on your behalf in order to refund a Driver, deduct such funds from the debit or credit card you have supplied to us or JustPark may settle the refund owed to the Driver directly with the Driver and then recover this money from you afterwards.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Your obligations<ol>\n<li>You must:<ol>\n<li>honour all bookings with Drivers and ensure that the Parking Space is

relevant certificate of insurance or other document issued to you.\nIf insurers wish to cancel this insurance contract, we/they shall contact you at the last known address we/they have for you on our/their records.</p>Return Premiums<p>Return premiums may arise if an insurance risk is reduced or a policy cancelled.\nA return premium may be allowed by insurers depending on the precise policy terms and conditions.\nInsurers may not allow a return premium if any claims have been made under the current insurance contract.</p>Security (Solvency of Insurers)<p>We may use UK or Non-UK rated or unrated insurers for a particular client or risk.\nYou should be aware that a different legal and regulatory regime may apply for Non-UK insurers so your ability to enforce your legal rights or to seek compensation may vary.\nIf you do not wish to use a Non-UK or unrated insurer, please advise us immediately.</p>\n<p>We do not guarantee the solvency of any insurer we place business with.\nWe do not monitor insurer solvency on an ongoing basis, and shall not be liable for losses suffered by you in the event of the insolvency of an insurer.\nIf an insurer with which you have a policy becomes insolvent, you may still be liable for any unpaid premiums you owe it and we may be unable to collect any return premiums that might be due to you.</p>Client Money<p>We hold money received from you, or to pay to you, as \u2018client money\u2019, either:</p>\n<p>As your agent in a statutory trust bank account, which, in the unlikely event of our failure, is available to clients ahead of insurers and other creditors.\nor</p>\n<p>As agent of your insurers under agreements with some insurers specifying that premiums and claims monies received by us are held as agent for those insurers.\nThis is termed \u2018risk transfer\u2019.</p>\n<p>Statutory trust accounts are subject to strict controls set out in the FCA CASS Handbook including rules in relation to segregation, establishing the trust, and the detailed operation of the trust.\nThese controls provide robust protection in relation to funds held on behalf of policyholders and insurers.</p>Confidentiality of Personal Information <p>If you are an individual, we will process your personal information responsibly, fairly and in accordance with the WeCovr Privacy Notice available at https://wecovr.com/privacy.</p>\n<p>We will hold and process such personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in order to provide our services to you.\nand</li>\n<li>to comply with applicable laws, prevent and detect fraud, and cooperate with regulators where appropriate, as outlined in the WeCovr Privacy Notice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unless we are notified of any changes, we shall assume the personal information we hold about our customers is correct.\nWe may pass information about you to credit reference agencies for the purpose of arranging payments by instalments and may also pass to them details of your payment record with us.\nUnder data protection legislation, individuals have the right to see personal information about them that we hold in our records.\nIf you wish to exercise this right, or have any related queries, you should contact us.\nFor more information on how we process your personal information and your rights with respect to your personal data, visit the WeCovr Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>You will ensure that all personal information provided to us is accurate and, where appropriate, kept up to date, and will notify us if you become aware that such personal information is inaccurate.</p>\n<p>You will provide us with reasonable assistance, upon request, in dealing with any requests, inquiries or complaints that we receive from data subjects and/or supervisory authorities in relation to any personal information processed under this Agreement.</p>Money Laundering/Proceeds of Crime Act<p>We are obliged to report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service any evidence or suspicion of money laundering at the first opportunity and we are prohibited from disclosing any such report (including the fact that such a report has been made).</p>\n<p>Claims payment will be made in favour of you.\nIf you require a payment to be made to a third party, then you must confirm the required payee name and details and provide a brief explanation for your request subject to relevant checks being completed on the third party.</p>Third Party Rights<p>Unless otherwise agreed between us in writing, no term of this agreement is enforceable under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.</p>Governing Law<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of England and Wales and the parties agree herewith that any disagreements over the interpretation of this agreement will be resolved through binding, informal arbitration.</p>", "created_at": "2021-03-30 17:56:38.843567", "updated_at": "2021-03-30 17:56:47.400579"}, {"id": 4507, "name": "Cancellation Policies EV Charging", "url":

you do not then you cannot register as a member of the Service, or make a booking for a parking space with our parking space operators we will collect the following data.<ol>\n<li>Name - we need to store this to identify you in the provision of our service.\nIt will be shared with parking space operators you make a booking with and users on our platform which you send messages to.</li>\n<li>Email - we\u2019ll send emails to you about your bookings and the JustPark service.\nWe may share your email with third parties (including parking space operators).</li>\n<li>Photo - if you upload a photo, we provide it to parking space operators so they can identify you and we use it to personalise any reviews you leave about parking spaces.</li>\n<li>Number plate (VRM) - we store this for enforcement purposes and also safety purposes.\nWe share this with third party enforcement companies and parking space operators along with parking session dates and times, and sometimes your name, subject to terms outlined in separate Data Sharing Agreements held between JustPark and these third party companies outlining each company\u2019s obligations relating to the General Data Protection Regulation 2018.\nWe also use the VRM to check with the DVSA that a vehicle has a valid MOT certificate at the time of a booking as this is a requirement of some of our space owners to ensure that vehicles parked in their spaces are safe and roadworthy.</li>\n<li>IP Address - this is used by us and some of our third-party providers to identify your device in the provision of our service.\nIt is also used for fraud checks and to ensure a secure product.</li>\n<li>Payment method - payment method details you provide (including name, email address and sometimes address) are sent directly to PCI-compliant third party payment providers.\nThey are not stored on JustPark servers and JustPark employees do not have access to these details.</li>\n<li>Booking history - we store a history of where and when you\u2019ve booked parking to make repeat use faster and easier for you, and in interest of your and our accounting purposes.</li>\n<li>Phone number - we store this so drivers can contact parking space operators and vice versa.\nPhone numbers are only shared when you\u2019ve made payment for a booking.\nWe also use it to make repeat use of our pay by phone service faster.\nWe may contact you via phone should there be any issues with your bookings or account.</li>\n<li>Reviews - if you choose to leave a review for a parking location, this will be shown to other drivers considering booking the space (only showing your first name and the initial of your last name).</li>\n<li>Non-JustPark spaces navigated to - we log which of these you launch navigation to in order to make repeat use faster and easier for you, and to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in.</li>\n<li>Location data - if you choose to enable location services, we will occasionally store your location services data to improve our parking availability engine - which helps us show you and other drivers when we think spaces will be available to park in.\nYou can stop this data from being stored by turning off your location services.</li>\n<li>Messages - messages you send to other JustPark users about a booking are visible only to that user and to JustPark staff</li>\n<li>Third party CRM tools - we send the following data to GDPR compliant Customer Relationship Management tools so that we can communicate with you: name, email, phone number and your customer support messages.</li>\n<li>Administering your booking - JustPark customer support workers may view the above data (aside from sensitive payment method details) when administering your booking.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Parking Space Listing Data - to list your parking space with us we will collect the following data:<ol>\n<li>Parking space address - we use this to show drivers where your space is.\nWe only reveal the full address to them after they've paid to park in it so that they can navigate there.\nBefore that the driver can only see the street name and a map pin showing the location of your space.</li>\n<li>Space description - this is a public-facing description you provide when adding your space which helps drivers decide if a space is suitable.</li>\n<li>Photos of your space - these public-facing photos help drivers decide if a space is suitable and help them access it on arrival.</li>\n<li>Facilities - these are public-facing space attributes, which you can optionally provide to help drivers decide if a space is suitable for them.</li>\n<li>Access instructions - if you provide these when adding your space, they are used to help drivers access your space.\nThey are not shown to the driver until they have paid to park in your space.\nOnce the parking session has finished, they are hidden from the driver.</li>\n<li>PIN code for accessing space - if you provide a pin code (e.g.\nfor a gate) it is given to drivers to help them access your space.\nIt is not shown to the driver until they have paid to park in your space.\nOnce the parking session has finished, it is hidden from the driver.</li>\n<li>Administering your space - JustPark customer support workers may view the above data when administering your space.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Other use of this information<ol>\n<li>We may notify you of certain offers and new products, subject to you giving your
