your current balance in your Account meets the minimum threshold amount of US$100, you will receive payment <em>no later than the 15th day of the following month,</em> provided, however, that WEBTOON reserves the right to delay payment in the event we suspect you have violated the Agreement and/or these Terms.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>4.3Payment Requirements</strong>\n<p>In order to receive

share of US$70).\nHowever, no payment would be made out to you, as your balance would be below the minimum threshold amount of US$100.\nThe balance of US$90 would carry over to the following month.</li>\n<li>\u2022If you earn US$110 during the month of June, your total balance would be US$130 (previous balance of US$20 + your June Net Ad Revenue share of US$110).\nWe would pay you US$100
