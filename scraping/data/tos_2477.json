provision for certain claims.\nThe claims to which this section applies are described below.\nThis section limits your and our rights.\nSpecifically, you understand that you and August are waiving the right to sue in court and have a jury trial for certain claims.</p>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree that all disputes and claims arising out of, or relating to, these Terms, or your use of the Services, Licensed Software and Device (including the arbitrability of any claim or dispute and the enforceability of this section), shall be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration.\nProvided however, that you agree that the terms of this arbitration section do not apply to determinations as to the ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Services, Licensed Software or Device.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitration under the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (AAA\u2019s) Commercial Arbitration Rules and conducted in San Francisco, CA, USA (or in the federal court district in which you reside at the time of making a claim, if mutually agreed by you and August in writing in the interest of fairness).\nYou and August also agree that the AAA Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply to the proceedings.\nThe AAA rules are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nYou and August are each responsible for their respective costs relating to counsel, experts, and witnesses, and any other costs relating to the arbitration.\nIn the event that you file for arbitration, August will pay for the arbitration administrative or filing fees in excess of $250 U.S.\ndollars, including the arbitrator and/or other AAA case management fees, for any dispute of $75,000 U.S.\nDollars or less, unless the claim is determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.</p>\n<p>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: Except as otherwise provided in this section, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and August specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.\nIf you choose to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of this section, as specified below, this class action waiver will not apply to you.\nNeither you, nor any other user of the Services, Device or Licensed Software can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Services, Device or the Licensed Software without having complied with the opt-out requirements below.</p>\n<p>Except as expressly set forth in this section, you and August may litigate in court only to compel arbitration under these Terms or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators.\nTo the extent that you have breached or have indicated your intention to breach these Terms in any manner which violates or may violate August \u2018s or any of its licensor\u2019s intellectual property rights, or may cause continuing or irreparable harm to August (including, but not limited to, any breach that may impact August \u2018s or it\u2019s licensor\u2019s intellectual property rights, or a breach by reverse engineering), August may seek injunctive relief, or any other appropriate relief, in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or August may choose to pursue a dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THESE TERMS (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\nYou may opt out of this Section by mailing written notification to August at support@august.com.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with August through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Section will have no adverse effect on your relationship with August.\nAny opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or in small claims court.\nIn addition, this arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n1, et seq.\n(the \u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.\nThe FAA\u2019s provisions, not state law, govern all questions of whether a dispute is subject to arbitration.</p>\n<ul>\n</ul> ", "created_at": "2020-12-29 20:43:09.591919", "updated_at": "2021-02-03

1.\nWhat Personal Information do we collect? <p>\n<em>Personal Information We Request for Use of the Services.&nbsp.\n</em>When you download the App and in order to use the Services, we require you to establish an account, for which we collect and store the following: your name, email, password, telephone number, the identification number for your locksets (\u201cProducts\u201d) and user and account verification identifiers.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Personal Information collected based on your use of the Services.\n&nbsp;</em>When you use the Services, we collect Personal Information that you may provide about yourself, such as user-name, as well as Personal Information about other people who have access to your Products, such as other family members, guests, and service providers like gardeners, house cleaners and/or others (\u201cInvitees\u201d).&nbsp.\nFor example, you may include email addresses and telephone numbers of Invitees who you are allowing to access your Products.&nbsp.\nWe may ask for access to your contact list, and you may consent to provide access to such list, which includes Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We collect Personal Information that

the App whether those messages are sent to us, an Invitee, or a third party.</p>\n<p>Also, if you enable the Auto-Unlock feature, the App will request your consent in order to track your location in order to determine when your App nears Products that you have permission to access (e.g., when you are near home).\nLocation information will only be stored on your device, and not on our servers.\nThis information will tell your mobile device to start listening for your lock more often (increasing the polling).\nThis improves the device\u2019s performance and saves your mobile device\u2019s battery life.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Personal Information we automatically collect.\n&nbsp;</em>When you use the App, we will create a user ID for your account and we also gather the following information for purposes of providing the Services when you download the App and/or access the Services: usage data about how and when you interact with the Services and Products, logs of when your Products are locked/unlocked, logs of those who lock/unlock your Products, the people that you invite to use your Products, and those people who may invite you to use their products.</p>\n<p>We also collect the following information about the devices on which the App is downloaded and the Products you use: the operating system of the device on which the App is downloaded (e.g., you, your invitees), the version of the App on such devices, information about your Products, including serial numbers, MAC address, software versions on such Products and installation dates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you choose to use the App to connect your Products with other products and services through the \u201cConnected by\u201d feature, we will collect information about your use of those other products.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Personal Information we receive when you use third party products and services</em>\n</strong>\n<strong>.\n</strong>If you access the Services through a third-party (e.g., by managing your device via your television remote or connecting your device to your home security system), use third-party applications or services through the \u201cWorks With\u201d feature, otherwise use a third party service provider in connection with the Services and Products, or request or authorize us to give access or data to a third-party service provider (e.g., a delivery service, property management or rental service), then that third party will send us data about you, such as an user ID.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Invitees.</em>\n</strong>\n<em>&nbsp.\n</em>As part of our Services, you may give Invitees permission levels to access your Products - e.g., to unlock and lock your door, and possibly even to pass this access along to others.\nNeedless to say, you must be careful of the people that you invite and the access that you give them.\nYou are responsible for all uses of your account, so be careful to secure this information and only give access to people you trust.\nAdditionally, certain portions of your Personal Information, as well as other information about your use of the Service and your Products may be shared with Invitees, such as your name and the status of the lock (e.g., locked or unlocked).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In connection with the guest invitation process, we may ask for access to your contact list.\nWe will only store information for contacts that you add as guests.\nWe will only access and store such information with your

binding arbitration.\nProvided however, that you agree that the terms of this arbitration section do not apply to determinations as to the ownership of any intellectual property rights in the Licensed Software or Device.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitration under the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (AAA\u2019s) Commercial Arbitration Rules and conducted in San Francisco, CA, USA (or in the federal court district in which you reside at the time of making a claim, if mutually agreed by you and August in writing in the interest of fairness).\nYou and August

of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u> Ability to Opt-Out of Mandatory Arbitration</u>\n</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or August may choose to pursue a dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\nYou may opt out of this Section by mailing written notification to August at support@august.com.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with August through arbitration.\nYour decision to opt-out of this Section will have no adverse effect on your relationship with August.\nAny opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your dispute in arbitration or in small claims court.\nIn addition, this arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n1, et seq.\n(the \u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.\nThe FAA\u2019s
