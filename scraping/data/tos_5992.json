validity of this arbitration\nagreement will be made by the arbitrator, not by any court.\nBY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING\nUP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A\nJURY TRIAL.\nIn arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or\npanel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury.\nArbitration is more informal.\nhowever, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award.\nThe\narbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association\n(\u201cAAA\u201d) and conducted under AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and the\nSupplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the\n\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect at the time of the dispute.\nYou may obtain copies\nof the AAA Rules and

proceedings.\nHowever, if shipnowpaylater.co is the prevailing\nparty in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award\nattorneys\u2019 fees and costs to shipnowpaylater.co.\nIf

BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY.\nThere shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class\naction basis or in a purported representative capacity.\nNo claim submitted to\narbitration is heard by a jury or may be brought as a private attorney general.\nYou do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to\narbitration.\nThe arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims\nagainst shipnowpaylater.co and may not preside over any kind of\nrepresentative or class proceeding against shipnowpaylater.co.\nYou\nacknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the\narbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from

upon the Terms of Use in\nforce at the time of your use.\nYou can always check the most current version\nof the Terms of Use at this page.\n</p>\n<p>\n18) Termination\nWe will have the right to terminate your access to the website if we reasonably\nbelieve you have breached any of the terms and conditions of this TOS.\nFollowing termination, you will not be permitted to use the website and

Terms\nThis TOS will be binding upon each party hereto and its successors and\npermitted assigns and governed by and construed in accordance with the\nlaws of the State of Nevada without regard for conflict of law principles.\nThis\nTOS and all of your rights and obligations under them may not be assignable\nor transferable by you without our prior written consent.\nNo failure or delay by\na party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this TOS will operate\nas a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right, power\nor privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of\nany other right, power, or privilege under this TOS.\nYou are an independent\ncontractor, and no agency, partnership, joint venture, or
