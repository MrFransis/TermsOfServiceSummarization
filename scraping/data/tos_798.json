age are not allowed to visit our site.\nWe do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18 and our service is not directed to children.\nIf we learn or have reason to suspect that a Site user is under the age of 18, we will delete that user's account or use that information only to respond directly to that child (or a parent or legal guardian) to inform him or her that he or she cannot use our Site.\nIf we suspect a user to be under the age of 18 but are not able to independently confirm it, or if the user's age is estimated to be under 18 by automated algorithms, we may silently block the user and hide their account.\nIn the case that we believe that person will attempt to create other accounts on the site to evade detection, we may silently block them from interacting with other users and hide their account without notifying them (i.e.\nsoft-block them), instead of deleting them.\nIF YOU ARE UNDER 18, YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO USE THIS WEBSITE OR APP.\nPLEASE CLOSE IT OR UNINSTALL IT IMMEDIATELY.<br>\n<br>\n<b>7.\nData security<br>\n</b>\n<br> Personal information you provide to us is stored on a password protected server accessible only by administrator.\nWe adhere to generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Site because any transmission of information over the Internet has its inherent risks.\nAny transmission of personal

personal information that you have provided to us or to ask questions about this Privacy Policy.\nWe reserve the right to refuse a request if we believe it would violate any law or cause the information to be incorrect.<br>\n<br>\n<b>9.\nUSING PATOOK FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES<br>\n</b>\n<br> If you are using Patook from outside the United States, please note that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States or Canada, where our servers are located and our central database is operated.\nBy using our services, you understand and agree that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.\nYou also understand that the United States might have less advantageous privacy laws than those in your home country and that we will abide by US law.\nIn general the majority of users are in the US and Canada.<br>\n<br>\n<b>10.\nWho can see my information/activity<br>\n</b>\n<br> Messages you send are stored on Patook servers.\nNotwithstanding any data breach or temporary bugs, as described in section 7 above, text messages are visible to both yourself and the recipient(s), unless we choose to hide or delete them.\nIn addition, Patook staff may view the contents of those messages if they suspect that you or the recipient have violated any of the terms of service, or for any other reason, including but not limited to: debugging an issue with messaging, investigating a problem with the app, if your account has been reported by another user, law enforcement requests, etc..\nSimilarly, image messages are visible to both yourself and the recipient, unless we choose to hide them.\nHowever, they may be viewed by Patook staff at any time.\nIn the case that automated algorithms suspect that the pictures you sent contain inappropriate material, the pictures may also be revealed to third-party moderators who are not affiliated with Patook for manual verification.\nIf your account gets reported by other users, said pictures may also be revealed to said third-party moderators.\nIn the event that automated algorithms suspect that you have broken the terms of service or etiquette (such as engaging in flirting, spamming, or trying to market products), your entire message history may be made visible to human moderators for verification.\nHuman moderators may be Patook staff or unaffiliated users.\nIn addition, please note that messages are not E2E encrypted - this means that upon governmental or other legal request, your messages may be made visible to the relevant party.<br>\n<br>\n<b>11- Advertising:<br>\n<br>\n</b>\n<br> We may use the contents of your profile, such as interests, age, location etc.\nto tailor our ads to you.\nWe may also use the contents of the profiles of the people you are talking to.<br>\n<br> Third party vendors, including Google may use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website or other websites.\nWe may provide them with age range and approximate location.<br>\n<br> Google's use of advertising cookies may enable it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.<br>\n<br> Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Ads Settings\n.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b> 12- European Union users:<br>\n</b>\n<br> If European Union (EU) data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can exercise your right to request access to, update, remove, and restrict the processing of your information.\nYou also have the right to object to the processing of your information or receive a machine-readable copy of your information.\nTo do so, simply e-mail privacy@patook.com to make that request.\nWe will generally ask for identification and verification, as we typically do not require e-mails or other personal information to make an account.<br>\n<br> If you have concerns regarding your rights under local law, you can contact your local data protection authority.\n<br>\n<br> We process your information for the purposes described in this policy, based on the following legal grounds:<br>\n<br>\n<u>With your consent<br>\n</u> We ask for your agreement to process your information for specific purposes and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.\nYou can manage these settings in your Patook account (Under Me -&gt.\nPrivacy Settings (or Data Privacy).<br>\n<br>\n<u>When we're pursuing legitimate interests<br>\n</u> We process your information for our legitimate interests while applying appropriate safeguards that protect your privacy.\nThis means that we process your information for things like:<br> o\tProviding, maintaining, and improving our Services to meet the needs of our users<br> o\tDeveloping new products and features that are useful for our users<br> o\tUnderstanding how people use our Services to ensure and improve the performance of our Services<br> o\tCustomizing our Services to provide you with a better user experience<br> o\tMarketing to inform users about our Services<br> o\tProviding advertising to make many of our Services freely available for users<br> o\tDetecting, preventing, or otherwise addressing fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues with our Services<br> o\tProtecting against harm to the rights, property or safety of Patook, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law<br> o\tPerforming research that improves our Services for our users and benefits the public<br> o\tFulfilling obligations to our partners like developers and rights holders<br> o\tEnforcing legal claims, including investigation of potential violations of our Terms of Use.\nIn general, the Terms of Use include fines and penalties that we may choose to legally enforce at any time before the statue of limitations expire.\nFor example, this includes fines for sending inappropriate pictures or advertising multi-level marketing schemes.\nIn those cases, our legitimate interests will be to maintain any information about your account that we deem necessary to enforce the fines in court, including the offending pictures.<br>\n<br>\n<u>When we're complying with legal obligations<br>\n</u> We'll process your data when we have a legal obligation to do so, for example, if we're responding to legal process or an enforceable governmental request.\nPlease keep in mind that Patook is based in the United States (US) and thereby will respect US law first and foremost, regardless of where you are located.\nFor example, we cannot decline an enforceable US governmental request even when it is not in line with EU law.\nThis is also outlined in the Terms of Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<u>EU Data Sharing with 3rd parties:<br>\n</u> The in-app consent form has the list of providers with whom we share certain limited information.\nYou can opt out of those using the in-app consent form (Me -&gt.\nData Privacy/Privacy Settings).\nAs of May 23rd, 2018 the list is:<br> 1- Microsoft PhotoDNA - to check for illegal exploitation of children.\nYou can opt in/out from within the app.\nThis affects photos shared/uploaded/sent.<br> 2- Microsoft AppCenter - to investigate crashes.\nYou can opt in/out from within the app.<br> 3- Google Ads - for personalizing ads.\nYou can opt in/out from within the app.<br> 4- Google Firebase Analytics - for monitoring performance of our app.\nYou can opt in/out from within the app.<br> 5- GetIPIntel - for checking the IP address for fraud.\nThis only involves sharing the IP address <br>\n<br> The list may grow without being reflected here, but we'll ask for consent before sharing data with anyone else.\nThe ultimate list is maintained in the consent form within the app (Me -&gt.\nData Privacy/Privacy Settings).<br>\n<br> EU Data Retention: in general, while you haven't deleted your account, we will retain your data.\nWe may delete accounts that have been inactive for over two years and have made no submissions whatsoever or kept their profile mostly empty.\n<br> If you delete your account, all your information will no longer be visible to other users.\nFor users in good standing, we will generally:\n<br> a- Delete all the pictures you uploaded, except for those that were marked as containing pornographic, term of service violations, or illegal material.\nAs the Patook ToS contain explicit fines for people sharing inappropriate pictures, we will retain them for the statute of limitation, should we wish to apply our legitimate interest of enforcing the terms of service.\nIf illegal material is involved, we may retain them until any investigation and court cases have been completed.\n<br> b- Hide all your information and generated content.\nThis includes messages to other users that will now disappear.<br> c- Delete all the content you generated from the main database and backups.\nThis can take up to 6 months until it has also been deleted from the backups - however, certain data will be deleted immediately.<br>\n<br>\n<br> However, sometimes business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information for specific purposes for an extended period of time.\nFor example, if you are caught violating the Terms of Service, or are banned, we may retain this information for a longer period of time to guard against abuse, enforce our Terms of Service fines, or for legal purposes.\nReasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:\n<br>\n<br> Security, fraud &amp.\nabuse prevention<br> Enforcement of ToS fines<br> Financial record-keeping<br> Complying with legal or regulatory requirements<br> Ensuring the continuity of our services<br>\n<br> Some examples where we will typically retain information: if you are caught stalking or harassing users.\nif you are caught sending inappropriate pictures and refuse to pay the fine.\nif you are caught trying to enlist users in a pyramid scheme or Multi-level marketing scheme.\nif you use the site illegally, etc.\n<br>\n<br> Information that you posted publicly on your account (such as your user profile, username, etc.) can be seen by all other users and can be captured or screenshotted at any time.\nThis can include any sensitive information you publicly posted such as sexual orientation, political affiliation, etc.<br> For example, even though it is against the Terms of Service, someone still can take a screenshot of your public profile and post it elsewhere without your permission.\nOr if you're talking to a user, they can take a picture of your conversation.<br> While we do not share your information outside of the points described above (in points 12 and 4, etc.), anytime you willingly post information publicly or exchange it with another user, we cannot guarantee that those users will not make or share a copy of the information during the time it was visible to them.\n<br>\n<br> We use encryption technology to encrypt sensitive personal information before it travels over the internet.\nCredit card numbers are never stored on our database or servers.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>13.\nBreach Reporting<br>\n</b> As Patook does not require e-mails, real names, addresses, phone numbers of other identifying information, it may be impossible for us to notify you directly in the case of a breach or hack.\nShould such a breach occur, we will post it at this link:<br>\nReported potential breaches<br>\n<br> Depending on scale, we may also update the homepage to notify users that a breach has occured.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>14.\nRights of California Residents</b>\n<br> If you are a California resident, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes.\nTo make such a request, please send an email to privacy@patook.com.\nPursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83(c)(2), we do not share your personal information with third parties' direct marketing use unless you elect that we do so.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>15.\nChanges to this privacy policy<br>\n</b> We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion.\nWhen we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will

paragraph.\nYou agree to pay the whole amount within 30 days of receiving a notification from Patook LLC.\nA breach of this Paragraph shall occur for each inappropriate picture sent to each user.For example, should a user send the same inappropriate messages to three users, at the same time or at different times, that user will be liable for three $250 violations or $750 in total damages.\n</p>\n<p> d.You understand that pictures or activities that appear to be of an illegal nature may be automatically or manually submitted to law enforcement authorities or other bodies such as the NCMEC, sometimes solely at the discretion of automated algorithms or human moderators.\nYou understand that Patook makes no guarantee that the picture you are posting, viewing or sending is legal in nature, nor that you are legally allowed to view it.\nYou understand that Patook does not independently verify user ages.\n</p>\n<p> e.You will not take or share screenshots of other users' profiles or pictures with the public.\nHowever, you may take a screenshot of users who have talked to you and share it privately or with close friends for safety reasons.\nWe reserve the right to log any attempts at taking screenshots, and to prevent your device from taking screenshots at any time and for any reason.\n</p>\n<p> f.We may ban, block, censor, redact or otherwise restrict your account or profile at any time, and for any reason we deem appropriate, without notifying you.\nWe may partially or entirely hide your account and activity from certain users, or from all users.\nWe may hide your messages from certain users or all users.\nThis can be done manually by moderators, automatically by algorithms, or in any way we deem appropriate.\nWe may choose not to deliver certain messages or all the messages you send.\nThose determinations may be made entirely algorithmically by analyzing some or all of your activity on the site, and we will not disclose any information or reason as to why that determination was made, or how those algorithms work.\n</p>\n<p> g.\nAny attempt to reverse engineer the site or flirt detection algorithms will result in an immediate ban and, if done on behalf of a company or competitor, may result in legal action.\nThis includes but is not limited to: creating multiple accounts to communicate with one another and figure out which messages are delivered, creating an account shortly after deleting another, contacting users to ask them if your messages are going through, or reverse engineering the code or passing special parameters to the app, experimenting with the app to try to find patterns or weaknesses (without our permission).\n</p>\n<p> h.Any attempt to contact users outside of the app without their explicit permission (such as for example, guessing their Facebook name from their first name and city/pictures, or reading their Snapchat alias off their Patook profiles, and adding them as Snapchat friends without having talked to them within Patook) may result in an immediate ban.\n</p>\n<p> i.Only one account per user is allowed.\nUsers caught with more than one account may be permanently banned and have all their accounts disabled.\nUsers who delete their account, only to create another one shortly thereafter may be permanently banned.\n</p>\n<p> j.If you are found to be willingly impersonating a different person, either real or invented, you agree that you will cause irreparable harm to Patook but that the exact level of the harm may be difficult to ascertain.\nAs a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur, you may be liable for up to $250 in liquidated damages per violation.\nIn this paragraph, impersonating a different person includes but is limited to: using someone else's pictures, lying about your gender, subtantially altering your age, pretending to be a different person that the other user may know.\nPatook may charge you $250 for each breach of this paragraph of the Terms.\nThe $250 in damages is a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook will incur, from lost user revenue and damage to Patook's reputation, due to a breach of this paragraph.\nYou agree to pay the whole amount within 30 days of receiving a notification from Patook LLC.\nA breach of this Paragraph shall occur for each user you contact under the fake assumed identity.For example, should a 35-year male user posing as a 22 year old woman contact three women using that fake identity, that user will be liable for three $250 violations or $750 in total damages.\nIn addition, you agree that Patook may, at its discretion, notify every user you have contacted about the breach, including in said notification both your fake and real information.\n</p>\n<p> &nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b> 6.<u> Prohibited Uses of the Site and Liquidated Damages for Violations </u>\n</b>\n</p>\n<u> No Advertising or Commercial Solicitation.\n</u> &nbsp;You will not advertise or solicit any user to buy or sell any products or services through the Site.\nYou may not transmit any chain letters, junk or spam e-mail to other users.\nFurthermore, you will not use any information obtained from the Site in order to contact, advertise to, solicit, or sell to any user without their prior explicit consent.\nThis prohibition includes marketing services, products or businesses, recruiting users for either paid or unpaid jobs (both legitimate and illegitimate jobs), recruiting for pyramid schemes, or recruiting for multi-level marketing companies.\nIf you breach the terms of this subsection, or send or post unsolicited bulk email, \"spam\" or other unsolicited communications of any kind through the Services, you acknowledge that you will have caused substantial harm to Patook, but that the amount of such harm would be extremely difficult to ascertain.\nAs a reasonable estimation of such harm, you agree to pay Patook $100 for each such unsolicited communication you send through the Services.\n<u> Banned user.\n</u> If you are banned from Patook, for whatever reason, you will make no attempt to ever register an account again without Patook's written express permission.\nAs a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur, you may be liable for up to $250 in liquidated damages per new account created.\nAs a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur from banned users creating unauthorized new accounts, you agree to pay Patook the sum of $250 if you create a new account after having been banned, and an extra $250 for each subsequent account you create after being banned.\nIf you were talking to a user that was banned, Patook will have no responsibility to inform you that the user was banned and what the reason was, even if it was a terms of service violation.\nIn general, Patook does not notify any users when a ban occurs.\n<u> Pyramid Schemes and MLM schemes.\n</u> If you are found to be attempting to recruit users for a pyramid, marketing or other Multi-Layer Marketing (\"MLM\") scheme, you agree to pay Patook the sum of $250 for each user that you contacted as a reasonable approximation of the damages that Patook may incur due to you attempting to recruit another user for a pyramid marketing or other MLM scheme, even if that specific user did not reply or you did not begin recruiting them.\nIn this section, recruiting also includes: a- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSending overview or informational videos to users regarding the MLM companies.\nb- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nInviting users to informational seminars.\nc- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nMoving the conversation outside of Patook and then proceeding to recruit the user, or doing points (a) and (b) above outside of Patook with a user you met on Patook for that purpose.\nYou understand that Patook will not warn you before taking such actions.\nYou understand that Patook may report you to the law enforcement authorities of your country and provide all the communications you had on the site, including your messages and physical location.\nYou agree that Patook may take additional precautions against such behavior, including, but not limited to, publishing your information/photo/contact info on a public list of known MLM schemers, or contacting all the users you were in touch with and asking them to report you.\nIn the event that you contest that a specific scheme is an MLM, Patook will make the final determination as to whether that is the case.\nIn general, any kind of money-making scheme will fall under this category.\nYou also agree to report any scheme that falls under this category, and that Patook will in no way be liable if you are a victim of MLM or pyramid schemes.\n<p> &nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>

or is deleted by moderators of the Site for any reason, all the credits associated with their account will be deleted.\n<u> Coupons: </u> the site allows the use of coupons to receive additional credits.\nCoupons can expire at any time and often have a maximum number of uses.\nIn addition, coupons may be revoked, and cannot be exchanged for money.\nThey are also non-transferrable and have no cash value.\n<u> Verified Profiles: </u> some user profiles on the site have a verified profile tag next to them.\nThis means that a picture of that user holding a \"Patook\" sign was sent to a moderator and a minimal verification was done.\nIt doesn't mean that the site or the Company made any additional verification, nor is it a guarantee that the person's profile is genuine.\nFor example, users may provide verification and then change their picture to something else.\nOr they may forge verification pictures.\nTherefore, there is absolutely no guarantee that the person is who they claim they are, or that they are of the same age they claim to be (for example, they could be below the age of 18).\n<u> Advertising: </u> Patook may from time to time choose to show advertisements on the
