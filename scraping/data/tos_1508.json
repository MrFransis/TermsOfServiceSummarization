content.</em>\n</p>\n<p>In order to help make platform improvements, we need to delete inactive content in free Screencast accounts.\nAs you can imagine, more than a decade of content builds up, most of which was only viewed for a short time! To arrive at this retention policy, we sought customer input and chose an approach that impacts as few customers as possible.</p>\n<p>We will base retention on usage of the content - if twelve consecutive months have passed without your free content being viewed, we will consider the content inactive and permanently delete it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Starting November 2, 2018 TechSmith will begin deleting free Screencast content not viewed in the past year (twelve months).</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This means any free Screencast content that hasn\u2019t been viewed since November 2, 2017 will be permanently deleted as soon as November 2, 2018.</p>\n<p>Going forward, we\u2019ll continue this practice of deleting inactive free Screencast content on a regular basis.\nThis means we will store free Screencast content for a minimum of one year after the upload date, but it will be deleted if not viewed for one year.\nThis deletion will be permanent.</p>\n<p>Once it\u2019s deleted, you will not be able to view, download, or access the content in any way, and we will be unable to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>If you do not want your inactive content, no further action is needed! We\u2019ll delete it, freeing up additional space in your account.</p> How to avoid losing your content <p>\n<strong>If you have a free Screencast account, you must take action by November 2, 2018 to avoid content loss.\n</strong>Keep inactive content with one of these three options:</p> 1.\nUpgrade to a paid Screencast Pro account <p>You will keep all of your content, regardless of how often it is viewed.\nSee all the ways Screencast Pro will benefit you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To help with this transition, from now until November 2, 2018 <strong>we\u2019re offering 25 percent off the first year of a

experience better and modernize the Screencast platform, we\u2019re making changes to our content retention approach beginning November 2, 2018.\nThese changes make way for improvements that will benefit all Screencast users, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New, faster platform for storage and delivery</li>\n<li>Security improvements, including https secure content delivery</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Screencast Pro customers will enjoy more storage! &nbsp;We are increasing Pro storage and bandwidth limits by about 20% starting late 2018.</p>\n<p>This platform investment

from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\n<p>When we collect Personal Information as a processor on behalf of the controller, the controller is the party who provides instructions
