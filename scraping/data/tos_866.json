Commercial Partners remain Data Controllers.</p>\n</li>\n<li> 1.2.\n<u>Legal Basis for Processing of Personal Data</u>\n<p>The GDPR provides several situations upon which Dailymotion can rely for Processing of Personal Data, namely consent, contractual necessity, compliance with a legal obligation, vital interests of data subjects, public interest or legitimate interest.\nSimilarly, applicable laws may provide other or similar legal bases, as explained further below in the country specific sections.</p>\n<p>When Processing of your Personal Data requires your consent, we ask you to communicate your consent either via a positive action (e.g.\nby activating \u201cAccept\u201d button on our Site, Secondary Site or Video Player) or via an explicit decision for each of the purposes your consent is being collected for, in accordance with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>Dailymotion participates in the \u201cTransparency &amp.\nConsent Framework\u201d (\u201c<b>TCF</b>\u201d), developed by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) and complies with its Specifications and Policies.\nWe operate a TCF-compliant Consent Management Platform (IAB / TCF identification number 105) for the consent collection and management for Dailymotion\u2019s and our Commercial Partners\u2019 data processing activities in connection with Dailymotion Service and, in general, for the communication of user consent information to our Commercial Partners.\nDailymotion is also registered with the IAB as a Vendor (IAB / TCF identification number 573).</p>\n<p>You can always choose not to consent to Processing of some of your Data, withdraw your consent, or oppose such Processing (unless the applicable laws authorize or require us not to take into account such decision) as further explained herein.\nHowever, this may limit your ability to take full advantage of the many features we offer, including features that are needed for our Service to operate as it is intended to and, consequently, seriously deteriorate your user experience.\nIf you do not agree to the collection and use of Data needed for our Service to operate at its optimal capacities, we strongly advise you not to use Dailymotion Service as we will not be capable of providing you with the high quality service you may expect from us.<u>\n</u>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> 1.3.\n<u>Transfer of Data</u>\n<p>The Data collected by us through our Service may be sent to and stored on servers located in the United States, France, and other countries around the world.</p>\n<p>We ensure that legally required, appropriate contractual or other mechanisms are present prior to transfers of Data outside of the EEA.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>DATA WE COLLECT<p>We may collect Personal Data that can identify you directly, such as your name and email address, and other information that does not identify you directly.\nThis Section explains what Personal Data we collect and how we collect such

<b>Third-Party Data</b>\n<p>We may, if you authorized such third parties to share such information with us or if we believe that such sharing is in conformity with the applicable laws, receive from them or share with them information about you originating from other sources, such as data aggregators, public databases, and our Commercial Partners, be it affiliated or unaffiliated entities.\nShared data (whether identified, pseudonymized or anonymous and whether collected online or offline) may include information about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your online activities (such as websites you have visited and/or advertisements you have viewed).</p>\n<p>We may combine the shared information with the information we collect from or about you and

we use, directly or via our subcontractors, various technologies to collect usage data and store your user settings.\nThe Data thus collected helps us propose, protect and improve the Dailymotion Service and to personalize your user experience by adapting the Content and advertising to your taste.\n</p>\n<p>Despite a variety of the actual measures deployed, the various technologies used to collect data are commonly referred to as \u201c<b>cookies</b>\u201d and their use is regulated by \u201ccookie laws.\u201d Whenever the applicable laws subject the use of cookies to user consent, Dailymotion asks for your consent prior to their use.</p>\n<p>A \u201ccookie\u201d is a small data file that is transferred to your computer\u2019s hard disk.\nA cookie life is limited to its purpose and does not, in general, exceed 13 months.\nA cookie expires upon the end of its validity period.\nA cookie may be deleted before the end of its validity period if you or the technologies you use (e.g.\nyour operating system) do so.\nThe different categories of cookies and assimilated technologies we use are further described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>- Cookies and Local Storage</b>\n<p>We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to offer you a high quality Service, better understand how you interact with the Dailymotion Service or with marketing material advertising the

collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as \"Flash cookies\") and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player.\nThese technologies are sometimes referred to as \"browser cookies\" even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer.</p>\n<p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.\nBy changing your browser settings, you can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.\nFor further information on disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies in general, please click here.\nPlease note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the Dailymotion Service, including the Video Player.\nFor example, we may not be able to store your preferences (such as the language to be used by the Service) or login information (such as keeping your connection session active thus allowing you to be automatically recognized by the Services when you repeatedly access Dailymotion Service on the same device) or customize the Content and advertising to your online viewing habits.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>- Web Beacons, Pixels and other Trackers</b>\n<p>In addition to cookies, we may use other similar technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails.\nThese technologies are mainly used to learn whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message.\nand determine other usage details including the time and date on which you viewed Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from

and service providers, who use mobile SDKs to collect information such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \"ad-ID\" or \"IDFA\") and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Dailymotion Service.\nAn SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to be implemented (a mobile SDK is a mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon, described above).\nFor instance, we may use this technology to analyze how you interact with Content and advertisements and to enable analytics or other features through mobile devices.</p>\n<p>The uses of these various technologies, notably in connection with advertising on the Dailymotion Service, are further explained in Section 3 below.</p>\n<p>To learn more about our cookie management rules we invite you to read our Cookie Policy.\nYou may, at any time, manage your cookie settings and chose the purposes for which you

our affiliated companies.\n(Vivendi group companies) may share the information we have about you.\nWe do so for a common purpose - in order to learn more about your tastes and offer you more personalized services, products and ads</p>\n<p>When disclosed Data is used by a Commercial Partner for its own purposes, it is that Commercial Partner who is a Data Controller for the Processing it undertakes.</p>\n<p>Dailymotion works with a large number of Commercial Partners.\nThe list of Dailymotion Comercial Partners is published on our Service and may be consulted at all times from within the \u201c<b>Manage Cookies</b>\u201d section.\nNote that it does not mean that when you watch a video on our Service all of these Commercial Partners process your Personal Data.\nOnly the Commercial Partners (or their technical service providers) involved in posting the ads shown to you or publishing Content that you watch on Dailymotion Service process your data.\nThe identity of our Commercial Partners who actually process your data depends on the Content and ads you watch on our Service.</p>\n<p>As a Data Controller, each Commercial Partner determines the purpose for which it wishes to

(\u201cCCPA\u201d)</b>\n<ul>\n<li> 8.6.1.a.\n<b>General</b>\n<p>If you are a California resident, in addition to any other information you may find in this Privacy Policy, this section is intended to provide you with specific information required under the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201c<b>CCPA</b>\u201d).\nIn particular, this section describes Dailymotion\u2019s practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure and sale of consumers\u2019 Personal Information (hereafter referred to as \u201c<b>PI</b>\u201d) and includes an explanation of your rights regarding your own PI.</p>\n<p>Note that rights and obligations provided under the CCPA take effect on 1st January 2020.\nIf you decide to exercise any of such rights your request will be considered as of that date.</p>\n<p>The terms \u201c<b>Personal Information,</b>\u201d \u201c<b>Business,</b>\u201d \u201c<b>Third Party</b>\u201d and \u201c<b>Service Provider</b>\u201d used in this section have the same meanings as defined in the CCPA.</p>\n<p>If you have an account with Dailymotion, we identify you by the email address you use to log-in.\nHowever, if you do not have an account, in most cases, we rely on a unique online identifier to identify and recognize you.</p>\n<p>When you access our Service, a Dailymotion cookie (i.e.\na small text file) is dropped on your device\u2019s browser.\nThis cookie creates a unique online ID specific to the Dailymotion Service and allows us to recognize you when you visit us again (\u201c<b>Service ID</b>\u201d).\nIf you use different devices or different Internet browsers to access our Service (and unless you do so as a logged-in user, in which case we might be able to recognize you regardless of the device or browser used), you are assigned a different Service ID for each of your device/ browser combinations.\nIn other words, if you first accessed the Dailymotion Service using Internet Explorer on your laptop, but then visited it on your phone using Chrome you will appear to us as two distinct users.\nUnless you access the Dailymotion Service as a logged-in user, any information that we might have about you is attached to that Service ID.</p>\n<p>Due to legal rules applicable to our activities, the lifespan of our cookies is limited to 13 months.\nOnce the 13-month period comes to an end, the Dailymotion cookie storing your Service ID expires.\nIf you continue to use our Service, a new Dailymotion cookie will be dropped on your browser and a new Service ID will be assigned to you.</p>\n<p>As already mentioned in this Privacy Policy, we do not cross-reference Service IDs that are assigned to you on our Service.\nUnless you are a logged-in user (in which case we may recognize you regardless of the number of Service IDs created for you, and we process your requests in relation to all Personal Data linked to your account), each new Service ID represents to us a new user.\nFor that reason, if you decide to exercise any of your CCPA rights, your decision will only be applied to the Service ID we recognize you under.\nIn particular, if you use the Dailymotion Service on several devices or Internet browsers, your decision to Opt-Out of the sale of your PI needs to be expressed on each such device or browser.</p> 8.6.1.b.\n<b>Collected Personal Information: Categories, Sources and the Business or Commercial

or a Third Party for monetary or other valuable consideration.</p>\n<p>Dailymotion does not engage in data brokerage nor knowingly sells PI of minors under 16 years of age.\nAs part of our regular business activities (i.e.\noperating an online service offering access to videos and displaying ads), your PI may be disclosed to companies we cooperate with.\nThese companies may use such information to help us conduct our business activities (in doing so, they are our Service Providers), as well as for their own business purposes.\nIf they do use your PI for their own business activities, our disclosure of your PI amounts to its sale.</p>\n<p>In addition, our advertising partners collect PI, such as digital identifiers (e.g.\nonline identifiers, IP address), activity history (how you interact with their ads) and electronic information, when you use our Service and are shown their ads.\nThat information is used to deliver, analyze and tailor ads you see on our Service or elsewhere.\nTo tailor ads that may be more relevant to you, we or our commercial partners may share it with Third Parties.</p>\n<p>If you do not want us to sell your PI, you may decide to Opt-Out as further explained below in Section 8.6.1.e.</p>\n<p>The following categories of PI may be disclosed or sold by us:</p>Category of PICan the PI be Disclosed?

exercise any of these rights either directly or through an authorized representative.\nIf you wish to make a request regarding your PI via an authorized agent, you must provide this agent with your written permission, which is to be submitted to Dailymotion together with copies of your and your agent\u2019s official IDs at the time of filing a request.\nWe may ask for additional documents or information if we judge them necessary to verify the agent\u2019s authority to act on your behalf, the extent of the authorizations you have granted and to identify your PI.</p>\n<p>Your choice to exercise any of the above-listed rights will not result in any discriminatory treatment.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> 8.6.1.e.\n<b>Right to Opt-Out from Sale of Personal Information</b>\n<p>You have the right

not affect previously sold PI.</p>\n<p>To exercise this right, click on the \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d link available within this Privacy Policy and on our Service.\n<u>Note that this link may not be visible or functional if you access our Service using a non-California IP address</u> (e.g.\nwhile accessing Dailymotion Service from a different state or country or doing so using location-masking technologies such as a proxy or a VPN (Virtual Private Network) software).\nIf you are a California resident and encounter problems in the exercise of your Opt-Out right, such as if you are not physically in California at the time, we invite you to contact us directly using either of the contact methods listed in Section 8.6.1.h.\n</p>\n<p>Upon exercising your right to Opt-Out, we will cease selling your PI, i.e.\nwe will refrain from disclosing it to Third Parties for their own business purposes.\nWe will also communicate your decision to all Third Parties to whom your PI may have previously been sold during the 90-day period preceding your request.</p>\n<p>Note that while we will not sell your PI once you exercise your Opt-Out right, we may still disclose such information to our business partners in order for them to help us carry out our own business activities.\nIn these circumstances, our business partners will act as our Service Providers and they will not be allowed to use your PI for any purposes other than those we ask them to.</p>\n<p>We remind you that an Opt-Out decision is limited to the device and the browser used.\nIf you use our Service on different devices or via different browsers, your Opt-Out decision needs to be communicated to us separately on each of them and renewed every time the associated Service ID is no longer active.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if your Service ID is no longer recognized by our Service (either because the cookie it is stored in has expired or because you or the technology you use (e.g.\nyour

of your PI.\nYou will be alerted if a transaction requires the sale of your PI in order to complete.</p>\n<p>Opting back into the sale of your PI is an easy two-step process: you just have to request to opt-in and you will then be asked to confirm your choice.\nYou may do so by clicking the \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d link or by using any of the other contact methods described

our Support Team) or provide additional supportive documents as necessary to confirm your identity and identify your PI.\n</p>\n<p>Note that in order to comply with requests to access, delete, or disclose a consumer\u2019s PI, it is mandatory for Dailymotion to first verify such requests.\nThe CCPA rights in relation to your PI can only be exercised by you, meaning that your request cannot concern PI that is not yours and no one else can exercise the CCPA rights in relation to your PI (unless acting as an authorized agent on your behalf).\nConsequently, we need to take reasonable measures to verify the identity of the person sending us a request, as well as that person\u2019s entitlement to exercise the CCPA rights and to identify the information such request relates to, before we process the request.\n</p>\n<p>The actual verification process may take different forms depending on the circumstances of your request.\nFor example, if you have a Dailymotion account, you
