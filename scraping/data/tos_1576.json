"xpath": "/html/body/div[3]/section[2]/div", "text": " Privacy statement Intuitive Password operates several websites including IntuitivePassword.com.\nIt is Intuitive Password's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.\nBelow is our privacy statement which incorporates these goals: (1) We don't allow you to send any critically important information such as your sensitive data, login password and Master Password to any person including our employees.\n(2) We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.\n(3) We don't share or sale your personal information including your email address with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.\nWebsite visitors Like most website operators, Intuitive Password collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nIntuitive Password's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Intuitive Password's visitors use its website.\nFrom time to time, Intuitive Password may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\nIntuitive Password also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.\nIntuitive Password does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.\nGathering of personally identifying information Certain visitors to Intuitive Password's websites choose to interact with Intuitive Password in ways that require Intuitive Password to gather personally identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that Intuitive Password gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.\nFor example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at IntuitivePassword.com to provide an email address.\nThose who engage in transactions with Intuitive Password are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.\nIn each case, Intuitive Password collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Intuitive Password.\nIntuitive Password does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.\nAnd visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website related activities.\nUse of personal data Intuitive Password may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.\nFor instance, Intuitive Password may monitor the most popular website account on the IntuitivePassword.com site.\nIntuitive Password may display this information publicly or provide it to others.\nIn addition, Intuitive Password may use your behavioral data and other data you provide to Intuitive Password to customize advertisements on its site to its users.\nIn this way we try to keep the majority of our services free.\nHowever, Intuitive Password does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.\nProtection of certain personally identifying information Intuitive Password discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Intuitive Password's behalf or to provide services available at Intuitive Password's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.\nSome of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.\nby using Intuitive Password's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.\nIntuitive Password will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone.\nOther than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Intuitive Password discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Intuitive Password believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Intuitive Password, third parties or the public at large.\nIf you are a registered user of an Intuitive Password website and have supplied your email address, Intuitive Password may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Intuitive Password and our products.\nWe expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.\nIf you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nIntuitive Password takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.\nCookies A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nIntuitive Password uses cookies to help Intuitive Password identify and track visitors, their usage of Intuitive Password website, and their website access preferences.\nIntuitive Password visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Intuitive Password' websites, with the drawback that certain features of Intuitive Password's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\nChanges to privacy statement Although most changes are likely to be minor, Intuitive Password may change its Privacy Statement from time to time, and in Intuitive Password's sole discretion.\nIntuitive Password encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Statement.\n", "created_at": "2021-09-06 23:47:35.098239",
