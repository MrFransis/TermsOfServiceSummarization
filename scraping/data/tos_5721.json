Services.</strong> DoNotPay may offer Services to be paid for on a recurring basis (\u201cSubscription Services\u201d) or on an as-used basis (\u201cA La Carte Services\u201d and, together with the Subscription Services, \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\nDoNotPay has the right to change, delete, discontinue or impose conditions on Paid Services or any feature or aspect of a Paid

fee and any applicable taxes as set forth in your DoNotPay Account settings or as otherwise agreed in writing (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d).\nIf you sign up for Subscription Services for a period (\u201cInitial Period\u201d), then the terms will be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial Period at our then-current fee for such Subscription Services.\nIn order to avoid automatic renewal, you must cancel your Subscription Services at least 2 calendar days (48 hours) prior to the automatic renewal date.\nYou may cancel your account online (in account settings) or by sending an email to support@donotpay.com.</p>\nRecouping Payments and Additional Contributions:\nDoNotPay requires ACH bank account access or payment details for three reasons:\n<ol>\n<li>To send you any money reclaimed from corporations and governments.</li>\n<li>To process any payments made in the app, including your subscription to DoNotPay.</li>\n<li>To process any external government/corporation fees to help you complete your task.\nFor example, if you ask DoNotPay to pay your parking ticket for you, it will debit the cost of paying the parking ticket from your connected account.\nDoNotPay will always secure permission in writing from you before debiting any external fees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We will recoup payment directly from your connected account.\nBy using our&nbsp;services, you authorize us to initiate debit and credit entries to your&nbsp;bank account, or if you link a debit card to your account, you authorize&nbsp;us to charge your debit card, for all payments due to us.&nbsp;You agree to maintain a balance that is sufficient to fund all payments&nbsp;you initiate.\nIf the balance is insufficient, you authorize us to recoup payment from your connected account over nominal increments.\nHowever, DoNotPay will attempt to avoid charging your&nbsp;bank account if we believe your bank account does not contain&nbsp;sufficient funds to cover payment.</p>\n<p>Our failure to charge your bank account for repayment within a set&nbsp;amount of time does not constitute a waiver of our right to charge your&nbsp;account for such funds.\nYou represent and warrant that you have the&nbsp;right to authorize us to charge your account for payments due to us&nbsp;under these Terms.\nYou will indemnify and hold DoNotPay harmless&nbsp;from any claims by any other owner of the account.</p>\n<p>DoNotPay\u2019s authorization to initiate debit and credit entries to your&nbsp;bank account will remain in full force and effect until you revoke your&nbsp;authorization.\nIf you wish to revoke your authorization, you may do so&nbsp;by contacting support@DoNotPay.com at least three business days&nbsp;before the day a transaction is scheduled.\nPlease note that your&nbsp;revocation of authorization when transactions are pending could result&nbsp;in delays to your receipt of funds and additional charges owed by you&nbsp;to DoNotPay.\nYou are responsible for any costs or damages related to&nbsp;the timing of authorization revocation.</p>\n<p>DoNotPay is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees,&nbsp;or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or&nbsp;similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or&nbsp;available credit in the bank account that is sufficient to fund all&nbsp;payments you initiate.</p>\n<p>In order to allow you to use certain Services, we may be required to&nbsp;verify your identity.\nYou authorize us to make any inquiries we&nbsp;consider necessary to validate your identity.\nThese inquiries may&nbsp;include asking you for further information, requiring you to provide a&nbsp;taxpayer identification number, requiring you to take steps to confirm&nbsp;ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a&nbsp;credit report, or verifying information you provide against third party&nbsp;databases or through other sources.\nIf you do not provide this&nbsp;information or we cannot verify your identity, we can decline to allow&nbsp;you to use the Services.</p>\nPrivacy
