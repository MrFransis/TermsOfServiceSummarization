We invite you to access our websites and use the Evernote service, but please note that your invitation is subject to your agreement with these Terms of Service.\nThis document describes in detail your rights and our rights relating to the provision of the Service (as defined below), so please review these Terms carefully.</p>\nWhat Are the Terms of Service?\n<p>The Terms of Service constitutes a contract between Evernote and you.\nThe Terms include the provisions set forth in this document and in the Evernote Privacy Policy, Commercial Terms, Evernote Busines\u00ad\u00ads Agreement, User Guidelines, IP Compliance Program and other terms or conditions that may be presented by us and accepted by you from time to time in connection with specific Service offerings (all of which we collectively refer to as the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d or \u201cTerms\u201d).\nIf you do not agree to these Terms, you do not have the right to access or use our Service.\nIf you do register for or otherwise use our Service you shall be deemed to confirm your acceptance of the Terms and your agreement to be a party to this binding contract.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By using the Service, you acknowledge, accept and agree with all provisions of the Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, the use and treatment of the text, images, and other data you choose to input, upload, or store in Evernote (collectively, \u201cContent\u201d) and your personal information in accordance with such Privacy Policy.</p>\nWhat Is the Evernote Service?\n<p>The Evernote Software (as defined below), the Evernote service, and other products, services and websites hosted or made available by Evernote, including, for example our App Center, User Forum, and Help &amp.\nLearning pages are collectively referred to in these Terms as the \u201cService\u201d.\nIn exchange for being enabled to use the Service, you agree to abide by these Terms.</p>\nIf This Is a Contract, Who Are the Parties?\n<p>You, the Account Holder, are one party to this contract.\n(An Account Holder is the person or entity who has contracted with Evernote as either an individual Basic, Plus, or Premium user or as a Customer as defined in our Evernote Business Agreement.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you reside in the United States or Canada, then the other party to this contract is Evernote Corporation, a corporation headquartered in California.\nIf you reside in Brazil, then the other party to this contract is Evernote do Brasil Servi\u00e7os de Aplica\u00e7\u00f5es Ltda., a company headquartered in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, State of Sao Paolo, Brazil (\u201cEvernote Brasil\u201d).\nIf you reside outside of the United States, Canada and Brazil, then the other party to this contract is Evernote GmbH, a company headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.\n(Evernote Corporation, Evernote GmbH and Evernote Brasil, as applicable, may be referred to in these Terms of Service as \u201cEvernote,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and sometimes \u201cus\u201d).</p>\n<p>On some occasions, you may be purchasing products or service subscriptions from an authorized reseller.\nPlease review our Commercial Terms for information about additional contract terms relating to such purchases.</p>\nIs This the Only Contract I Have with Evernote?\n<p>It depends upon how you interact with the Evernote service and our software applications.\nIf you install any Evernote Software on your computing devices, you may be asked to agree to an end user license agreement.\nIf you pay for an Evernote subscription, you will be asked to agree to the Commercial Terms.\nIf you use related Evernote products or services (such as Evernote Business) or participate in our User Forum, you may also need to enter into a separate agreement with us (usually by clicking \u201caccept\u201d or \u201cagree\u201d).\nWe refer to each of these as a \u201cSeparate Agreement.\u201d If that happens, the Separate Agreement shall take precedence if there is a conflict between those terms and this Terms of Service document, to the extent of such conflict and with respect to the particular subject matter of that Separate Agreement.</p>\nWill These Terms of Service Ever Change?\n<p>These Terms may be amended as new features, technology, or legal requirements arise, so please check back from time to time.\nIf we make a significant change, we\u2019ll notify you and, where required, seek your consent.</p>\n<p>If we do update these Terms, you are free to decide whether to accept the updated terms or to stop using our Service (see \u201cHow is My Account Closed\u201d below).\nyour continued use of the Service after the effectiveness of that update will be deemed to represent your agreement with, and consent to be bound by, the new Terms.\nExcept for changes made by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms shall be effective unless set forth in a written agreement expressly amending these Terms and bearing a written signature by you and us.\nFor clarity, email or other communications will not constitute an effective written agreement for this purpose.</p>\nWhat Do I Have to do to Use the Evernote Service?\n<p>First, you need to create an Evernote service account.\nYou create an account by providing us with an email address and creating a password.\n(Some older accounts also required a username.) We refer to this as your \u201cBasic Subscriber Information\u201d.\nWe encourage you to use a distinct and non-obvious password that is different from passwords you use for any other service.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the accuracy, completeness and confidentiality of your Basic Subscriber Information, and you will be responsible for all activities that occur under your account, including activities of others to whom you have provided your Basic Subscriber &nbsp;Information.\nWe will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to provide us with accurate information or to keep your Basic Subscriber Information secure.\nIf you discover any unauthorized use of your Basic Subscriber Information or suspect that anyone may be able to access your private Content without authorization, you should immediately change your password and notify our Customer Support team.</p>\n<p>Second, you will need to access your account through a web browser or by installing our client software on your computers, tablets and phones.\nObtaining those devices and paying for their connectivity and data plans is your responsibility.\nEvernote also has no responsibility for the availability of the Internet and other telecommunication services necessary to access the Service.</p>\nCan I Share My Account with Someone Else?\n<p>Evernote service accounts should not be shared.\nIf you share your Basic Subscriber Information with anyone, that other person may be able to take control of the account, and we may not be able to determine who is the proper Account Holder.\nWe will not have any liability to you (or anyone you share your Basic Subscriber Information with) as a result of your or their actions under those circumstances.\nSince you may use a free Evernote service account, and since we provide a number of mechanisms to allow you to share your account Content with others, we strongly urge you not to share your information with anyone, unless you are doing so as part of your estate planning purposes, as discussed below.</p>\nOnce I Have an Account, What Are My Rights in the Evernote Service?\n<p>Once your account is created and you accept these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Service subject to these Terms, for so long as you are not barred from receiving the Service under the laws applicable to you, until you close your account voluntarily or until we close your account pursuant to these Terms.\nIn addition, we grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the Evernote Software provided to you by or on behalf of Evernote, for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Evernote Software and enjoy the benefit of the Service, subject to any applicable license terms provided with the Evernote Software and these Terms, until your rights are terminated in accordance with such license and/or these Terms.\nYou do not obtain any other right or interest in Evernote or the Service.</p>\nEvernote\u2019s Data Protection Laws Say My Data Is Mine \u2013 What Does That Mean?\n<p>You retain copyright and any other rights you already held in your Content before you submitted, posted or displayed it on or through the Service.\nBut you do have to grant Evernote a limited license, as described below, so we can make your data accessible and usable on the Service.\nOther than this limited license and other rights you grant in these Terms, Evernote acknowledges and agrees that we do not obtain any right, title or interest from you under these Terms in any of your Content.</p>\nWhat Is the License I Have to Grant to Evernote?\n<p>In order to enable Evernote to operate the Service, we must obtain from you certain limited license rights to process your Content that is covered by intellectual property rights so that technical actions we take in operating the Service are not considered legal violations.\nFor example, copyright laws could prevent us from processing, maintaining, storing, backing-up and distributing certain Content, unless you give us these rights.\nAccordingly, by using the Service and uploading Content, you are granting Evernote a license to display, perform and distribute your Content and to modify (for technical purposes, e.g., making sure content is viewable on smartphones as well as computers and other devices) and reproduce such Content to enable Evernote to operate the Service.\nYou also agree that Evernote has the right to elect not to accept, post, store, display, publish or transmit any Content in our sole discretion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You agree that these rights and licenses are royalty free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide and irrevocable (for so long as your Content is stored with us), and include a right for Evernote to make such Content available to, and pass these rights along to, others with whom Evernote has contractual relationships related to the provision of the Service, solely for the purpose of providing such services, and to otherwise permit access to or disclose your Content to third parties if Evernote determines such access is necessary to comply with its legal obligations.</p>\n<p>If you elect to use any third party service or application that is integrated with Evernote, you also agree that the licenses granted to Evernote in the preceding paragraph shall apply to Content that is submitted or uploaded through such third party service or application.\nIf the third party service or application you elect to use would access or extract Content, you grant Evernote the right and license to enable third party access to and extraction of your Content.\nEvernote does not assume any responsibility for, or liability on account of, the actions or omissions of such third party applications or service providers.</p>\n<p>As we rely upon your rights to upload and distribute your Content, you represent and warrant to Evernote that (1) you have the unfettered legal rights and authority to submit your Content to Evernote, to make any other use, publication or other distribution of that Content in your use of the Service, and to grant the rights granted to Evernote under these Terms.\nand (2) your Content complies with our User Guidelines and these Terms.</p>\n<p>Finally, you understand and agree that Evernote, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Service to our users, may make such changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media.&nbsp;</p>\nWhat Other Assurances Do I Have to Grant to Evernote?\n<p>When you use the Evernote service to send messages to an email address, to a telephone number via SMS, or through a social media account (e.g., Facebook or LinkedIn) that has not been linked to an Evernote account, Evernote sends such messages on your behalf, and we are relying on your representation to us that you have a direct relationship with the recipient(s) and that you are respecting the legal rights of the recipient(s) not to receive certain kinds of messages (such as harassing messages, unsolicited commercial messages, and unwanted SMS messages).\nWhenever you send any kind of message to a third party you represent and warrant to Evernote that you are acting within the law and that you have prior consent from the recipient to send them such a message.</p>\nAre There Rules about What I Can Do on the Evernote Service?\n<p>Yes.\nYour use of the Service must be in accordance with these Terms.\nWhen it comes to your use of the Service, you agree that you are responsible for your own conduct and all conduct under your account.\nThis means all Content created, transmitted, stored or displayed in your account, is your sole responsibility as the person who created the Content or introduced it into the Service.\nThis applies whether the Content is kept private, shared or transmitted using the Service or any third-party application or services integrated with the Evernote service.\nOur User Guidelines provide more specific details regarding prohibited conduct on the Service.\nIf we find that any shared Content in your account violates our Terms of Service (including by violating another person\u2019s intellectual property or privacy rights), we reserve the right to un-share or take down such content.</p>\nI\u2019m Guessing Evernote Has Some Rights Relating to the Service?\n<p>We do.\nThey\u2019re described here:</p>\n<p>CONTENT RIGHTS.</p>\n<p>While you own the Content you store within the Evernote service (subject to third party rights), you acknowledge and agree that Evernote (and our licensors) own(s) all legal right, title and interest in and to the Service, including, without limitation, all software that is&nbsp;part of the Service and all Evernote software deployed by you or a third party to enable capturing of Content originating outside the Service, such as Evernote Scannable, Evernote Web Clipper, the Site Memory widget or any of the Evernote software applications for compatible computing devices that enable access and use of the Service through such device (the \u201cEvernote Software\u201d).</p>\n<p>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>\n<p>In agreeing to these Terms, you also agree that the rights in the Service and Evernote Software, including all intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents, designs and copyrights, are protected by one or more of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, regulations and treaties, in addition to these Terms and any Separate Agreement.\nIn particular, you agree to not modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from any Evernote Software, unless you are expressly permitted to do so under an open source license, we give you express written permission or you are otherwise legally permitted to do so notwithstanding this prohibition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RIGHT TO MODIFY THE SERVICE.</p>\n<p>We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to implement new elements as part of and/or ancillary to the Service, including changes that may affect the previous mode of operation of the Service or Evernote Software.\nWe expect that any such modifications will enhance the overall Service, but it is possible that you may not agree with us.\nWe also reserve the right to establish limits to the nature or size of storage available to you, the number of transmissions, the ability to send or receive email messages, the nature or size of any index or library information, the nature of, or your continued ability to access or distribute, your Content and other data, and impose other limitations at any time, with or without notice.\nFor example, if you use Evernote Basic, you will not enjoy all of the benefits provided to subscribers of Evernote Plus, Evernote Premium or Evernote Business.</p>\n<p>You also acknowledge that a variety of Evernote actions may impair or prevent you from accessing your Content or using the Service at certain times and/or in the same way, for limited periods or permanently, and agree that Evernote has no responsibility or liability as a result of any such actions or results, including, without limitation, for the deletion of, or failure to make available to you, any Content.\nYou agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of any part of the Service.\nHowever, if you are a subscriber for Evernote Plus, Evernote Premium, Evernote Business or another paid version of the Service (each a \u201cPaid Service\u201d) and find that any such modifications or interruption of the Paid Service adversely affects you, you may notify our Customer Support team, explain the adverse impact the modification has created and, if you desire, request a termination of your Paid Service.\nUpon receipt of any such request, we will endeavor to promptly remedy the adverse impact caused by the modification, extend the duration of your Paid Service subscription for a period of time equal to the interruption and/or refund a portion of your Paid Service subscription fee equal to the remaining unused term of the Paid Service subscription, as we determine appropriate or as may be required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>RIGHT TO ENGAGE THIRD PARTIES.</p>\n<p>Evernote engages certain affiliates or other third parties (\u201cService Providers\u201d) to provide technical or other services relating to all or part of the Service, and you hereby agree that such involvement by these Service Providers is acceptable.\nIn addition, Evernote may contract with third party resellers of the Evernote Plus, Premium or Business versions of the Service and payment processors to enable payments in your local currency and payment systems.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy to understand the extent to which any affiliate or third party may have access to your account information or Content and our Commercial Terms to understand our relationship with any reseller or payment processor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RIGHT TO USE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE.</p>\n<p>Evernote may from time to time include as part of the Service and Evernote Software computer software supplied by third parties which is utilized by permission of the respective licensors and/or copyright holders on the terms provided by such parties.\nWe provide information about some of this third party software here and within the particular Evernote Software.\nEvernote expressly disclaims any warranty or other assurance to you regarding such third party software.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>RIGHT TO UPDATE OUR SOFTWARE.</p>\n<p>In connection with any modification of the Service, Evernote may automatically download software updates on your computers and devices from time to time with the intention of improving, enhancing, repairing and/or further developing the Service.\nEvernote will endeavor to provide you with the option of whether or not to install the update.\nhowever, in certain circumstances (e.g., security risks), Evernote may require you to install the update to continue accessing the Service.\nIn all cases, you agree to permit Evernote to deliver these updates to you (and you to receive them) as part of your use of the Service.</p>\nDo These Terms Apply to Evernote Business Users?\n<p>If you are using the Service as part of an Evernote Business account, your use of the Service is governed by these Terms, except to the extent the Separate Agreement governing the Evernote Business account provides conflicting terms.\nThe Customer who has contracted with Evernote and the Administrator of the Evernote Business account (as \u201cCustomer\u201d and \u201cAdministrator\u201d are defined in the applicable Evernote Business Agreement) have the responsibility to and agree to share the terms of such Separate Agreement with each individual whose user account is linked to that Evernote Business account (\u201cEnd User\u201d).</p>\n<p>If you are an End User of an Evernote Business account, please note that the Customer of your Evernote Business account (such as your employer or organization) may have established its own rules regarding End Users\u2019 access, use, disclosure, or retention of data stored in that account.\nYou can find more information on how your personal Evernote service account works with your Evernote Business account in our Privacy Policy and in this Help and Learning article.</p>\nHow Does Evernote Respond to Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Violations?\n<p>We respond to clear and complete notices of alleged infringement of copyright, trademark or other intellectual property laws that satisfy the requirements in these Terms (which we believe to comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright and other applicable laws).\nIf you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our Compliance team according to the instructions provided by our IP Rights Compliance Program and we will investigate.\nNote that each owner of intellectual property is responsible for protecting their rights and taking any legal or other action they determine to be appropriate to do so, and Evernote does not accept any obligation to take any particular action to enforce or protect any party\u2019s intellectual property rights on their behalf.</p>\nCan Kids Use Evernote?\n<p>Evernote is not directed to minors, and any use by minors should only be done with the guidance, supervision and consent of their parents, guardians and/or authorized school officials.\nFurther, we rely on parents and guardians to ensure minors only use the Service if they can understand their rights and responsibilities as stated in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consistent with applicable law, Evernote does not knowingly collect personal information from minors without parental consent.\nIf we learn that we have inadvertently obtained information in violation of applicable laws prohibiting collection of information from children without such consent, we will promptly delete it.&nbsp;</p>\nWhere Does My Data Go?\n<p>The Service is available worldwide, but your data is stored in the United States, as described in our Privacy Policy.\nIf you use the Service, you acknowledge that you may be sending electronic communications (including your Basic Subscriber Information and Content), through computer networks owned by Evernote, its Service Providers, and other third parties located in California and other locations in the United States and other countries.\nAs a result, your use of the Service will likely result in interstate and possibly international data transmissions, and your use of the Service shall constitute your consent to permit such transmissions.</p>\nHow is My Account Closed?\n<p>You may deactivate your account with our Service at any time, for any reason (or no reason).\nHowever, if you want to deactivate your account you need to take certain specific steps, which are described in our Help &amp.\nLearning article entitled \u201cHow do I deactivate my account?\u201d.\nIf you subscribe to a Paid Service, you will need to cancel your subscription pursuant to our Commercial Terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Evernote may act to temporarily limit your use of the Service, suspend access to your account, or close your account, with or without notice according to these Terms.\nReasons for Evernote suspending or closing your account may include, without limitation: (i) breach or violation of these Terms (including the User Guidelines) or any Separate Agreement, (ii) an extended period of inactivity (determined in Evernote\u2019s sole discretion), (iii) your nonpayment of any fees or other sums due Evernote or any other party related to your use of the Service, (iv) the discontinuance or material modification of the Service (or any part thereof) or (v) unexpected technical or security issues or problems or extensive Unsupported Use.</p>\n<p>In most cases, in the event we elect to close your account, we will provide at least 30 days advance notice to you at the email address you have provided to us, so you have a chance to retrieve any Content stored on the Service servers (unless we determine that we are legally prohibited from providing such notice or enabling you to do so).\nAfter the expiration of this notice period, you will no longer be able to retrieve Content contained in that account or otherwise use the Service through that account.</p>\nWhat Happens to My Account when I Die?\n<p>Evernote\u2019s pledge to protect the privacy of your Content will continue, even after your death or incapacity.\nIf you wish to enable someone to have access to your Content or other data in your account after you are no longer able to provide them access, you need to implement a process for providing your information to them.\nWe will not provide your information, or your Content, to anyone, even next of kin, unless we determine that we are legally obligated to do so.\nWe encourage you to include your Basic Subscriber information, with instructions on how to access your Content, in your will or other estate plans, so that anyone you wish to have access to your account will have the means to do so.\nPlease see our Commercial Terms for information on terminating payment for Paid Services upon death or incapacity.&nbsp;</p>\nIf I Have a Great Idea to Share with Evernote, What Are My Rights?\n<p>When you submit any ideas, suggestions, documents and/or proposals relating to the Service (or other products or services) to Evernote through the \u201cContact Us,\u201d User Forum or Support interfaces or through any other channel or mechanism (collectively, \u201cContributions\u201d), you acknowledge and agree that: (i) your Contributions do not contain confidential or proprietary information.\n(ii) Evernote is not under any obligation of confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions.\n(iii) Evernote shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way.\n(iv) Evernote may have something similar to the Contributions already under consideration or in development.\n(v) your Contributions automatically become the property of Evernote without any obligation of Evernote to you.\nand (vi) you are not entitled to any accounting, compensation or reimbursement of any kind from Evernote under any circumstances.</p>\nDoes Evernote Serve Ads?\n<p>Our business model is to make the Service so valuable that our users will want to subscribe to a Paid Service.\nHowever, we may display advertisements and promotions on or in connection with the Service, some of which may be paid for by third parties.\nFor more information, please see our Privacy Policy and Cookie Information page.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some advertising or other messaging content we provide will be based upon information provided by third parties, and we shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by you as a result of any advertisements or other messages.\nFurthermore, your interactions with advertisers found on or through the Service, including, without limitation, all reliance upon advertising, all commercial transactions and legal obligations associated therewith, are solely between you and such advertisers.</p>\nWhat Else Do I Need to Know?\n<p>THIRD-PARTY LINKS, CONTENT AND PROGRAMMING.</p>\n<p>We may include or recommend third party resources, materials and developers and/or links to third party websites, content and applications as part of, or in connection with, the Service.\nWe may have little or no control over such sites or developers and, accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that (i) we are not responsible for the availability of such external sites, content or applications.\n(ii) we are not responsible or liable for any content or other materials or performance available from such sites or applications and (iii) we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, materials or applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INDEMNITY.</p>\n<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Evernote, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, Service Providers and other partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including legal and other professional fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to your use of any of the Service, any violation of these Terms of Service or any other actions connected with your use of the Service (including all actions taken under your account).\nIn the event of such claim, we will endeavor to provide notice of the claim, suit or action to the contact information we have for the account, provided that any failure to deliver such notice to you shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligation hereunder.</p>\n<p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.</p>\n<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service Is Available \u201cAs Is.\u201d YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE

encourage you to contact our Customer Support team if you have any concerns with respect to the operation of the Service or any Evernote Software, as we want to ensure that you have an excellent experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>INITIATING A FORMAL CLAIM.</p>\n<p>If you conclude that we have not satisfied your concern and that you must pursue legal action, you agree that your claim must be resolved by the processes set forth in these Terms.\nEvernote provides the Service to you on the condition that you accept the dispute resolution provisions described below, so if you initiate any claim against Evernote in any other manner, you shall be in violation of these Terms and you agree that Evernote shall be entitled to have such action dismissed or otherwise terminated and you agree to reimburse Evernote for its reasonable costs incurred in defending against such improperly initiated claim.\nYou agree that prior to initiating any formal proceedings against Evernote, you will send us a notice to our attorneys at legalnotice@evernote.com and state that you are providing a \u201cNotice of Dispute.\u201d Upon receipt of a Notice of Dispute, you and we shall attempt to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.\nIf the dispute remains unresolved, either you or we may initiate formal proceedings according to these Terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Except where our dispute is being resolved pursuant to an arbitration (as provided below), if you are a resident of the United States or Canada, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Evernote must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in San Mateo County, California.\nYou agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Mateo County, California (and, for the avoidance of doubt, to exclude the jurisdiction of any other court) for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.</p>\n<p>Except where our dispute is being resolved pursuant to an arbitration (as provided below), if you reside in Brazil, you agree that any claim or dispute you may have against Evernote

set out below, and subject to any applicable laws, if a claim arises between you and Evernote where the total value of such claim is less than US$10,000, the party initiating the claim may elect to have the dispute resolved pursuant to a binding arbitration process that does not require attendance in person.\nThis \u201cAlternative Dispute Resolution Process\u201d shall be initiated by either party sending notice to the other, in which event you and Evernote agree to use our reasonable efforts to agree within thirty (30) days upon an individual or service to manage the Alternative Dispute Resolution Process (the \u201cArbitration Manager\u201d) according to the following requirements: (i) neither party shall be required to attend any proceeding in person, (ii) the proceeding will be conducted via written submissions, telephone or online communications or as otherwise agreed upon, (iii) the fees for the Arbitration Manager will be borne equally by the parties or be submitted to the Arbitration Manager to determine as part of the dispute and (iv) the judgment rendered by the Arbitration Manager may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the European Union (EU), please note that we offer this Alternative Dispute Resolution Process, but we cannot offer you the European Commission Dispute Platform as we do not have an establishment in the EU.</p>\n<p>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p>If you reside in the United States or are otherwise subject to the US Federal Arbitration Act, you and Evernote agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between us - except any dispute relating to the enforcement or validity of your, our or either of our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights - shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\n(Note that if you were a Service user prior to December 4, 2012 and formally elected to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement pursuant to the procedures set out in our Terms of Service that were effective as of December 4, 2012, you are not subject to this Arbitration Agreement.)</p>\n<p>Our arbitration proceedings would be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules and procedures applicable at that time, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (to the extent applicable), as modified by our Arbitration Agreement.\nYou may review those rules and procedures, and obtain a form for initiating arbitration proceedings at the AAA's website.\nThe arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location.\nIf the value of the relief sought is US$10,000 or less, either of us may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on us subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing.\nAttendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or us, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.\nThe arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Evernote users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.\nThe arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court possessing jurisdiction over the parties, except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>The AAA rules will govern the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees, unless our Arbitration Agreement expressly provides otherwise.\nIf the amount of any claim in an arbitration is US$10,000 or less, Evernote will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, so long as (i) you make a written request for such payment of fees and submit it to the AAA with your Demand for Arbitration and (ii) your claim is not determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous.\nIn such case, we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA.\nIf the amount of the claim exceeds US$10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Evernote will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nIf the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Evernote for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Evernote on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.</p>\n<p>YOU AND EVERNOTE AGREE, AS PART OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.\nWE REFER TO THIS AS THE \u201cPROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.\u201d UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN YOUR OR OUR CLAIM WITH ANOTHER PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY ONLY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).\nANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER EVERNOTE USERS.</p>\n<p>Except with respect to the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions, if a court decides that any part of this Arbitration Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to apply.\nIf a court decides that the Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions is invalid or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of these Terms and this Section (What Do I Do if I think I Have A Claim Against Evernote?) will continue to apply.</p>\n<p>CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED.</p>\n<p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary or the applicable dispute resolution process, any claim or cause of action you may have arising out of or related to use of the Service or otherwise under these must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or you hereby agree to be forever barred from bringing such claim.</p>\n<p>The provisions of this section, entitled \u201cClaims Are Time-Barred\u201d shall be deemed to constitute a separate written legally binding agreement by and between you and us.</p>\n<p>SPECIAL NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA USERS.</p>\n<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3,

intended to apply to such anonymized/de-identified data.</p>\nHow does Evernote share or disclose my information? <p>Evernote is not in the business of selling or renting your information.\nHere are instances when we may disclose your information \u2014 and then only the minimum information necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We share your information with service providers who process data on our behalf, such as credit card processors and customer management systems.\nFor example, these service providers help us:\n<ul>\n<li>Operate, develop, and improve the features and functionality of the Service</li>\n<li>Complete your payment transactions</li>\n<li>Fulfill your sales and support requests</li>\n<li>Communicate with you as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We require these providers to agree to strict data protection requirements in keeping with our privacy policy standards and our obligations under data protection laws.&nbsp.\nYou can view the vendors we use to help us provide the Service on our&nbsp;Vendors page.</p>\n<p>We do not share your information with any third parties for their own advertising purposes.Learn MoreShow Less</p>\n<p>Examples of our service providers include PayPal and Adyen for processing payments from our paid users, Salesforce for helping us with our email communications and Evernote Business sales outreach, and analytics providers like Google Analytics.\nOther service providers include resellers that we work with to help distribute Evernote.\nIf you purchase a Paid Service from a reseller instead of directly from Evernote, we may need to share limited information with the reseller to ensure accuracy in payment, account management, and delivery of services to you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your Content is private unless you decide you want to share it.\nYou may choose to share using public links or through any of the Service\u2019s features that allow you to share or collaborate on Content (\u201cCollaboration Features\u201d).\nIf you choose to share, we may need to take steps to facilitate your collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn MoreShow Less</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are features in Evernote that allow you to publish and share some of your notes and notebooks publicly, but these are optional.\nAny information that you post in these locations, or in our user forum, can be read, collected, and used by anyone and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages.\nEvernote enables you to determine whether to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publicly accessible areas of our site, so you should carefully consider how you use the Service.\nEvernote is not responsible for any publication or use of any information you choose to post in these locations.</p>\n<p>When you use Collaboration Features, people you share with may see your user profile.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have not added any profile information, then you will be identified by the email address associated with your Evernote service account.</li>\n<li>If you are an Evernote Business user, other members of your Evernote Business account will see your full Evernote Business account profile.\nEvernote service users who are not in your Evernote Business account will only see your profile name and image.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, when you use Collaboration Features, the information you share is no longer private to you.\nFor example, by publishing or sharing any portion of your Content, you may be enabling each recipient of the shared material to access, use, display, perform, distribute, and modify that material.\nIn addition, Evernote enables you to use a variety of third-party services and applications that interact with the Service, and you should review the access rights you provide to those services or applications, as you may enable them to access or extract your Content through your agreements with those parties.\nMore information on the nature of these permissions may be found on our Third Party App Permissions page<u>.</u>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on the permission levels you set when sharing Content, anyone who has access to the shared material may be able to see the Content, information about where and when the Content was created, as well as the note history, tags, and reminders associated with a particular note.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the event of a merger, sale, or reorganization of all or part of our business, information covered by this policy may be transferred in connection with that deal.\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>As described on our Cookie Information page, we contract with third-party advertising networks in order to deliver relevant Evernote advertisements to you across the Internet and to manage our communications with you.\nWe do not use your Content for these purposes.\nIn addition, we may share with partners or service providers a hashed identifier to serve you relevant Evernote ads when you visit partners\u2019 and providers\u2019 websites, applications or platforms.\nWe may, for instance, participate in the Google Adwords Remarketing,&nbsp;Twitter Tailored Audience and Facebook Custom Audience services.\nTo learn more about the privacy controls that Google, Twitter and Facebook offer and honor for those respective services, please visit here for Google,&nbsp;here for Twitter, and here for Facebook.\nYou may opt out of certain ad targeting and retargeting services by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s opt-out page, or the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s opt-out page.</li>\n<li>We also may share information about you with third parties whenever you consent to or direct such sharing.\nThis includes, for example, if you connect your Evernote account with a third-party app in our App Center.Learn MoreShow Less</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Evernote works with a number of third-party applications and services.\nIn some cases, Evernote will partner with another company to provide an integration.\nIn addition, in our App Center, you can find a number of third-party applications and services that work with Evernote.\nIf you connect your Evernote account to these third-party services, you may be giving the partner access to some or all of your data, including, in some cases, your Content.</p>\n<p>Providing such access is entirely voluntary, and you\u2019ll receive notice and must consent before such access is granted.\nYou\u2019ll always be able to check which applications or services are authorized to access your account by visiting the applications page&nbsp;in your account.\nYou\u2019ll also be able to turn off access from connected applications and services whenever you want.</p>\n<p>Please consider your selection of such applications and services, and your permissions, carefully.\nWe encourage you to review each party\u2019s contract terms and privacy policy.\nTo learn more about third-party applications and what data they may access, visit our Third Party Application Permissions page.</p> How does Evernote respond to legal requests for my information?\n<p>We vigilantly protect the privacy of your account.\nWe will not disclose your information to law enforcement or other governmental authorities unless we believe it is required to comply with warrants, court orders, subpoenas, or other lawful government requests.\nThis may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards of due process.</p>\n<p>We narrowly interpret all information requests, and we only disclose Content in your account that is specifically responsive to a government warrant or where you have provided your explicit consent.\nIn accordance with our user notice policy, we will notify you if we believe we are compelled to comply with a third party\u2019s legal demand for your information, and we routinely push back on government orders to delay user notice that we view as overly broad.\nYou can find more information in our current Transparency Report.</p>\n<p>In addition, in rare cases, we may share your information as necessary to investigate or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, or potential threats against persons, property or the systems on which we operate the Service, or as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations.</p>\nHow can I manage my information stored in Evernote?\n<p>Consistent with our first law of data protection\u2014your data is yours\u2014in most cases, you can manage your information simply by logging into your account and editing your information directly within the Evernote Service.</p>\n<p>However, if you prefer, you can contact us at compliance@evernote.com&nbsp;to ask us to provide access to, correct, update, or delete your personal information.\nCalifornia residents should visit the section \u201cYour California Privacy Rights\u201d of this Privacy Policy for more information about specific rights and how to exercise those rights.\nPlease note that we may ask you for proof of account ownership and/or identity before fulfilling your request.\nWe will comply with such requests to the extent required by applicable law or the US-Swiss Privacy Shield and US-EU Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A Note for our European End Users about our Data Processing Grounds and your Data Access Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We process personal data originating from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland on one of three

information?</b>\n</p>\n<p>Evernote's mission is to help you remember everything important in your life.\nIn order to do that, we make the Content you store in Evernote readily accessible to you, until you make the decision to delete it.</p>\n<p>If you delete your Content and then sync, it will no longer be accessible to you or others who may access the Service.\nThe Evernote service\u2019s back-up systems may retain residual copies of your deleted Content for up to one year due to the nature of those systems\u2019 operations.</p>\n<p>Evernote provides you with features that allow you to communicate and collaborate with other users.\nPlease note that deleting your copy of these communications (such as messages) won't delete copies existing in the accounts of people you were interacting with.</p>\n<p>For users who are inactive for extended periods of time, we may close your account to satisfy our obligations under applicable law, and in accordance with our data retention policy.\nIf that happens, we will try to notify you before taking any action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What happens if I want to stop using Evernote?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As described above, you can delete your Content at any time, and you can stop using the Evernote service at any time.\nAnd as we promise in our third law of data protection, your data is portable.\nYou can export your notes at any time, as explained here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What happens if Evernote closes my account?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If Evernote deactivates your account due to a TOS violation, then you may contact us to request deletion of your Content, and we will evaluate such requests on a case by case basis, pursuant to our legal obligations.</p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Where does Evernote store my information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use Evernote Software on your computing device, such as by using one of our downloadable applications, some of your data will be stored locally on that device.</p>\n<p>When you sync your computing device with the Service, that data will be replicated on servers maintained in the United States.\nThis means that if you store information in or submit data to the Evernote website or Evernote Software and sync such Evernote Software with the Evernote service, you acknowledge your personal information will be transmitted to, hosted, and accessed in the United States.</p>\n<p>Data privacy laws or regulations in your home country may differ from, or be more protective than, those in the United States.\nWe will collect, store, and use your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, wherever it is processed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Which Evernote company is my data controller?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you live in

exhaustively, this page describes how each Evernote application uses key device features that may access or use your personal information.\nMany of these capabilities may be turned on or off through your device settings or your Evernote account settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Evernote Applications</li>\n<li>Evernote</li>\n<li>Skitch</li>\n<li>Scannable</li>\n<li>Penultimate</li>\n<li>Evernote Web
