Art.\n3 of the GDPR.\nthen references to \u201cpersonal information\u201d in this Privacy Policy are equivalent to \u201cpersonal data\u201d governed by the GDPR.</p>\n<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\nWe will normally collect personal information from you only where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you (e.g.\nto provide you with our Services), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have your consent.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Performance of a </strong>\n<strong>contract</strong>.\nThe use of your personal data may be necessary to perform a Customer Agreement or other contract that you have with us.\nFor example, if you contribute to a project, create a profile, post, and comment on our Sites, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Customer Agreement or contract.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legitimate interests</strong>.\nWe use your personal data for our legitimate interests, such as to provide you with the best content through our Sites, Services, and communications with users and the public, to improve and promote our products and services, and for administrative, security, fraud prevention and legal purposes.\nFor further details on the information collected by us, please see the sections above.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Consent</strong>.\nWe may rely on your consent to use your personal data for certain direct marketing purposes, such as sending you newsletter updates about Mattermost products and services.\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time through the unsubscribe feature provided with each marketing email

globally, the personal data you provide to us or that we collect may be transferred or accessed in various countries, including the United States of America.\nIf you are located in the European Economic Area or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.\nlaw, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than the jurisdiction you typically reside in.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>European Union Standard Contractual Clauses:</strong> Where this is the case, we will enter into guarantees to ensure that the right security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this Privacy Policy.\nIf we transfer information from the European Economic Area to third parties outside the European Economic Area and to countries not subject to schemes which are considered as providing an adequate data protection standard, we will enter into contracts which are based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses with these parties, unless any such transfer is permitted for other reasons under the GDPR.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Transfer under Art.\n49 GDPR:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, we may also rely on Art.\n49 GDPR to legitimize the transfer.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>U.-U.S.Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield: </strong>While Mattermost remains self-certified under the E.U.-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield and Swiss \u2013 U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, we are not relying on these frameworks for the transfer of personal data.\nTo see more information about our responsibilities under Privacy Shield, please see

your personal information for as long as we need to provide our Sites and/or Services to you and the Customer(s).\nAfter such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information.</p>\n<p>If you have an account on Mattermost Sites or Services, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to perform our contractual obligations, provide you services through the Sites, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights, or enforce our Customer Agreements and agreements.\nWe will delete information once it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information from Website Visitors: </strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Mattermost account.\nWe retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created so long as needed for our business purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information from Mattermost Self-Hosted and Cloud Products: </strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Depending on the Services plan, Customers may be able to customize their retention settings such that they are different than Mattermost\u2019s standard data retention practices.\nCustomers may also apply different settings to messages, files, or other types of Customer Data.\nThe deletion of Customer Data and other use of the Services by Customer may result in the deletion and/or de-identification of certain personal information and other information.</li>\n<li>Mattermost Cloud products will retain Customer Data in accordance with a Customer\u2019s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement and Customer\u2019s use of Services, and as required by applicable law.\nMattermost may provide the option for Customers to delete Customer Data after their subscription ends.\nThis request must be made by the customer, and Mattermost may require additional ID verification.\nMattermost will delete all information from currently-running production systems within one year of the deletion request.</li>\n<li>National commercial or financial codes may require us to retain certain Customer information for up to 10 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information from Community Members and Contributors:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Due to the open source nature of our products, services, and community, we may retain limited personal information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional integrity and nonrepudiation.\nFor example, if you provide your information in connection with a forum or blog post or comment, we may display that information even if you have deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community posts.\nAlso, if you contribute to a Mattermost project and provide your personal information in connection with that contribution, that information (including your name) will be embedded and publicly displayed with your contribution and we will not be able to delete or erase it because doing so would break the project code.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are involved in litigation or a governmental or regulatory investigation, then we keep personal information throughout the period of litigation or investigation and for a reasonable amount of time thereafter.\nIf a settlement means that we have to keep personal information for longer, then we keep personal information for the period required to administer the settlement.\nIf we provide personal information to law enforcement agencies, then we keep a record of this for one year beyond the end of the investigation.</p> Your European Union Privacy Rights Regarding Your Personal Information<p>If the provision of the GDPR is applicable, then you have certain rights with respect to the use of personal information on the Sites and Services.\nIf your Personal Information was submitted to us by a

of your personal data, to the extent that the accuracy of the data is contested by you, processing is unlawful, but you oppose erasure and we no longer need the personal data, but you still require

</li>\n</ul> Security Overview\u00b6\n<p>Security in Mattermost software is continually reviewed by developers, IT administrators, and security researchers accountable for deploying the software in their organizations.</p>\n<p>Multiple rounds of penetration testing and security analysis, in addition to internal reviews, have produced a long list of safeguards, processes, policies, and compliance features:</p>\n<p>Contents</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Security Overview</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Security Features</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Private Cloud Deployment with Secure Mobile Apps</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Centralized Security and Administration</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transmission Security</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrity and Audit Controls</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Authentication

compliance</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>FINRA compliance</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To expand on each:</p> Security Features\u00b6\n<p>Mattermost offers a host of features to help keep your private cloud communications secure.</p> Private Cloud Deployment with Secure Mobile Apps\u00b6\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Mattermost can run entirely behind your firewall as a single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mattermost mobile apps can be deployed to an internal Enterprise App Store by using source code available for Mattermost mobile apps and push notification service.\nOptionally VPN clients on PC and mobile devices can be used outside your private network.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally, Mattermost mobile apps can run without a VPN by opening standard ports on your Mattermost server, such as 80 or 443.\nIn this configuration, you have the option of using compiled iOS and Android applications in iTunes and Google Play provided by Mattermost, Inc.\n(E10, E20), as well as enabling multi-factor authentication (E10, E20).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User sessions across web, PC, and mobile can be remotely revoked through account settings, or via the System Console by deactivating accounts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mattermost apps can be packaged into leading Enterprise Mobility Management solutions including AirWatch and Blackberry through AppDome.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> Centralized Security and Administration\u00b6\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Manage users, teams, access control, and system settings in a web-based System Console user interface.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> Transmission Security\u00b6\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Mattermost supports TLS encryption using AES-256 with 2048-bit RSA on all data transmissions between Mattermost client applications and the Mattermost server across both LAN and internet.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Connections to Active Directory/LDAP can be optionally secured with TLS or stunnel (E10).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encryption-at-rest is available for messages via hardware and software disk encryption solutions applied to the Mattermost database, which resides on its own server within your infrastructure.\nTo enable end user search and compliance reporting of message histories, Mattermost does not offer encryption within the database.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encryption-at-rest is available for files stored via hardware and software disk encryption solutions applied to the server used for local storage or storage via MinIO.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encryption-at-rest is available for files stored in Amazon\u2019s proprietary S3 system using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (E20) when users choose not to use open source options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Option to exclude message contents from push notifications to comply with strict compliance policies, such as US HIPAA standards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ability to exclude or include the contents of messages in push notifications to avoid disclosure on locked mobile screens, and via relay servers from Apple and Google when sending notifications to iOS or Android mobile apps (relevant to compliance standards such as HIPAA).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> Integrity and Audit Controls\u00b6\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>By default, Mattermost stores a complete history of messages, including edits and deletes, along with all files uploaded.\nUser interface actions for \u201cdeleting\u201d messages and channels remove the data only from the user interface.\nthe data is retained within your database.\nIf your compliance guidelines require it, you can turn off users\u2019 ability to edit and delete their messages after they are posted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use an antivirus plugin to scan for viruses before uploading a file to Mattermost.\nSupports ClamAV anti-virus software across browser, Desktop App, and Mobile Apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Custom data retention policies on messages and file uploads is available (E20).\nA daily data deletion job can be scheduled that deletes messages from the database and user interface, and file uploads from local file storage or Amazon S3, which exceed the specified retention period.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The output and archives of server logs can be saved to a directory of your choice.\nMattermost server logs plus logs from your web proxy can provide an end-to-end history of system usage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ad hoc compliance reports of messaging by user, date range, and keyword, including edited and deleted messages are available (E20).\nTo protect against unauthorized use, all ad hoc report requests are logged.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Daily compliance reports compatible with third-party compliance solutions such as Global Relay and Actiance are also available (E20).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> Authentication Safeguards\u00b6\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To protect against brute force attacks, you can set rate limiting on APIs, varied by query frequency, memory store size, remote address, and headers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Session length, session cache, and idle timeout can be configured according to your internal policies, automatically forcing a user to re-login after a specified period of time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remotely revoke user sessions across web, mobile devices, and native desktop apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remotely reset user passwords via the System Console or via the command line.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mattermost supports integrated authentication with Active Directory and LDAP (E10) as well as SAML 2.0 SSO integration with providers including Active Directory Federation Services, Okta, among others (E20).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ability to require multi-factor authentication is also available (E10).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> Access Control Policy\u00b6\n<p>To prevent account enumeration, if a user logs in and enters incorrect login details a generic error is presented.</p>\n<p>Security is a top concern for organizations who deploy Mattermost in a private network.\nWhile running under existing policies and auth protocols of the private network, we prioritize a better user experience (telling a user what went wrong on login) ahead of preventing users on the private network from enumerating accounts.</p>\n<p>Mattermost is optimized to be deployed in a highly secure environment.\nHowever, admins are given a choice as to the deployment environment.</p>\n<p>When Mattermost is deployed outside a firewall, Admins must be aware that their system is exposed to issues inherent in public cloud deployments.\nIn this case, we generally follow the standards of leading online services.\nFor example, Gmail offers APIs that not only confirm whether an email account exists, but also displays the user\u2019s profile picture by default.</p>\n<p>Mattermost undergoes extensive penetration testing, security reviews, and security updates.\nYou can find further details and previous discussion in our GitHub thread.\nIn addition, the following policies are provided:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Limit communications to specific users, private channels, or team-wide public channels.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increase system security by restricting email-based account creation to email addresses from a list of specific domains, e.g.\n\u201ccorp.mattermost.com\u201d, \u201cmattermost.org\u201d, etc.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose whether to restrict or enable cross-origin requests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If sharing of public links for account creation or sharing of files and images are enabled, links can be invalidated via the System Console by regenerating salts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally add advanced passwords requirements with minimum numbers of symbols, numbers, lower, and uppercase letters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally restrict creation, renaming, archiving of channels, private channels and integrations to Team Admins, System Admins, or end users (E10).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optionally restrict sending team invites to Team Admins, System Admins, or end users (E10).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote> Security Updates\u00b6\n<p>Security updates address newly discovered attacks reported to Mattermost, Inc.\nby the security research community.\nDisclosures are made confidentially, under the Mattermost responsible disclosure policy, allowing for Mattermost, Inc.\nto provide security updates to the community prior to public disclosure.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<dl>\n<dt>Mattermost Security Updates Disclosures</dt>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A summary of security updates made based on past and on-going security analysis and penetration testing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n<li>\n<dl>\n<dt>Mattermost Responsible Disclosure Policy</dt>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An overview of how security issues are confidentially reported to and addressed by Mattermost, Inc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n</li>\n</ul> Security Policies\u00b6\n<p>For information on internal security policies, development guidelines, business continuity plans, and common security-related questions from enterprises, please see our Security Policies documentation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Mattermost performs a penetration test on the software no less than once per twelve (12) month period.\nCustomers may request a copy of any penetration test results upon five (5) days\u2019 written notice at any time, but no more than once per twelve (12) month period.</p> HIPAA compliance\u00b6\n<p>Deploying Mattermost as part of a HIPAA-compliant IT infrastructure requires a deployment team trained on HIPAA-compliance requirements and standards.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Mattermost offers HIPAA-relevant <strong>Technical Safeguards</strong> including:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Integrity Controls</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access Control</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Transmission Security</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Audit Controls</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HIPAA-compliant deployments commonly consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Omitting the contents of messages from mobile push and email notifications:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If your Push Notifications Contents option is set to <code>Send full message snippet</code> there is a chance Personal Health Information (PHI) contained in messages could be displayed on a user\u2019s locked phone as a notification.\nTo avoid this, set the option to <code>Send generic description with user and channel names</code> or <code>Send generic description with only sender name</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, setting Email Notifications Contents to <code>Send generic description with only sender name</code> will only send the team name and name of the person who sent the message, with no information about channel name or message contents included in email notifications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Beyond Technical Safeguards, HIPAA compliance deployments also require:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Administrative Safeguards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Physical Safeguards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Organizational requirements and other standards.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more, please review HIPAA requirements from the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p> FINRA compliance\u00b6\n<p>Mattermost Enterprise Edition E20 is designed to meet the cybersecurity requirements of the United States Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) as part of a customer\u2019s existing operational systems, including technology governance, system change management, risk assessments, technical controls, incident response, vendor management, data loss prevention, and staff training.</p>\n<p>FINRA reviews a firm\u2019s ability to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive customer information.\nThis includes reviewing each firm\u2019s compliance with SEC regulations, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Regulation S-P (17 CFR \u00a7248.30), which requires firms to adopt written policies and procedures to protect customer
