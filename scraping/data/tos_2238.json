way related to any third-party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms.&nbsp.\nIn the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure

federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>Arbitration Agreement</em>.\n&nbsp;Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with SoloLearn and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from SoloLearn.&nbsp.\nBoth you and SoloLearn acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, SoloLearn\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201c<strong>Personnel</strong>\u201d) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>\n<p>(a) <em>Arbitration Rules.\nApplicability of Arbitration Agreement</em>.&nbsp.\nAny dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California.&nbsp.\nThe arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS/Endispute LLC (\u201c<strong>JAMS</strong>\u201d) Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201c<strong>Rules</strong>\u201d) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules.&nbsp.\nJudgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>(b) <em>Costs of Arbitration</em>.&nbsp.\nThe Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.&nbsp.\nSoloLearn will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars.&nbsp.\nSoloLearn will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>(c) <em>Small Claims Court</em>.&nbsp.\nFurthermore, either you or SoloLearn may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.</p>\n<p>(d) <em>Waiver of Jury Trial</em>.<strong>&nbsp.\n</strong>YOU AND SOLOLEARN WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.&nbsp.\nYou and SoloLearn are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.&nbsp.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.&nbsp.\nIn any litigation between you and SoloLearn over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SOLOLEARN WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>(e) <em>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</em>.&nbsp.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS.&nbsp.\nCLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.&nbsp.\nIf however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor SoloLearn is entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.</p>\n<p>(f) <em>Opt-out</em>.\nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 5020 Franklin Drive, Suite 100, Pleasanton, CA 94588, USA, postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms.&nbsp.\nYou must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>(g) <em>Exclusive Venue</em>.&nbsp.\nIf you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or SoloLearn to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and SoloLearn agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p>(h) <em>Severability</em>.&nbsp.\nIf the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then
