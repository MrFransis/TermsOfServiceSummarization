Policy</p> Introduction <p>We know you care about your privacy and the protection of your personal information.\nWe also know it is our responsibility to be clear about how we protect your information.\nWe designed this Privacy Policy to do just that.\nIt explains the types of personal information we collect, and how we collect, use, maintain, protect, and share this information.\nThis Privacy Policy also tells you about the rights and choices you may have when it comes to your personal information.</p>\n<p>Some of what we say in our Privacy Policy is required by law, and may at times seem long and complicated, but we\u2019ve worked hard to try to make our Privacy Policy easy to understand and provide examples where possible.\nThe Xfinity Privacy Center includes more information about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to review and manage your personal information and account activity</li>\n<li>How to set your marketing and advertising preferences, and opt out of certain information sharing</li>\n<li>How our products and services help to protect you</li>\n<li>How you can better protect yourself online</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can review this Privacy Policy and the information in the Xfinity Privacy Center anytime.\nIf you still have questions, you can contact us for more information.</p> When the Privacy Policy Applies <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the information we collect when you use Xfinity-branded products, services, networks, and platforms, including our websites and mobile apps.\nIt also applies to other Comcast-branded products and services that link to it.\nWe\u2019ll refer to these as our \u201cServices\u201d in this Privacy Policy.\nIt also applies to the information we collect about you from third parties.\nThis Privacy Policy does <strong>\n<em>not</em>\n</strong> apply to non-Xfinity products, services, websites, and mobile applications that you may access or use through Xfinity platforms.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<p>Learn more about when the Privacy Policy applies</p>\n<p>Because this Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices for all of our Services, some parts may not apply to you.\nFor example, if you do not subscribe to Xfinity Voice (home phone service) or Xfinity Mobile, we will not collect call detail information.\nIf you do not subscribe to Xfinity Home, we will not collect home security event information.</p>\n<p>Some Services may have additional privacy practices that may be described to you in different ways, such as in a separate contract for Comcast Business Services.\nTo the extent there is an overlap between this Privacy Policy and a Service-specific privacy policy, the Service-specific policy or agreement will control with respect to that Service.</p>\n<p>This Policy does <strong>\n<em>not</em>\n</strong> apply to the non-Xfinity products, services, websites, and mobile applications that you may use through the Xfinity platforms.\nFor example, if you subscribe to Xfinity Internet and visit a news or shopping website, the privacy policy for that website will apply.\nIf you subscribe to Xfinity TV and use our Xfinity X1 platform to use a streaming service, the privacy policy for that streaming service will apply to information it collects.\nLikewise, if you connect your smart thermostat to your Xfinity Home security and automation service, the privacy policy of the smart thermostat company will apply to the information it collects.</p>\n</ul> The Personal Information We Collect and How We Collect It <p>To provide you with our Services, we collect your personal information.\nThis can include information that does not personally identify you \u2014 such as device numbers, IP addresses, and account numbers.\nIt may also include information that does personally identify you, such as your name, address, and telephone number.\nWe call any information that identifies you \"personally identifiable information\" or \"PII.\"</p>\n<p>If you allow others to use your Comcast or Xfinity accounts or Services, we will also collect personal information about those individuals.\nIf you are not a Comcast or Xfinity customer, but use our Services through someone else\u2019s account, we will collect information about you, but it may not identify who you are to us.\nWe may also collect information about you from third parties.</p>\n<p>We collect this information to provide our Services, respond to your requests, and to tailor our Services to best meet your needs and interests.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<p>Learn more about the information we collect and to see examples.</p> What We Collect <p>\n</p> Account Information Information we use to identify who you are and/or to provide or maintain your account and Services, which may include

identifies who you are to anyone.\nAlthough permitted by federal law, we do not disclose your name and address to non-governmental entities, such as charities or businesses, for their own marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you may ask us to share information that personally identifies you with another company.\nIn that instance, we will make sure you give us clear direction about what you want us to share and with whom, before we share that information.</p>\n<p>Other sharing with third parties can include:</p>\n<p>\n</p> Social Media Companies You may interact with parts of our Services that cause information to be published to your social networks.\nFor example, you may click on a Facebook \"like\" button, which publishes to your Facebook account that you \"like\" one of our Services.\nOn those parts of our websites with social network functionality, a social network may be able to collect information about you.\nFor example, if a page contains a Facebook \"like\" button, Facebook may be able to collect data about your visit to that page, even if you don\u2019t click on the \"like\" button.\nTo control this sharing of information, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or sign out of it before you use our Services.\nOnline Advertising Partners We may use cookies to deliver personalized advertising to you when you visit other websites, including advertising based on the products and services you viewed on our Services.\nWe also allow our partners, including advertisers and service providers, to use cookies and similar tracking technologies when you use our Services.\nFor more information about the use of cookies and other technologies on our online Services, please see the Cookies Notice.\nAudience Measurement and Analytics Companies We work with business partners to help us measure and analyze how our customers are using our Services.\nFor video, this includes assessing which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, whether people are watching advertisements, and what programming and video content we will carry on the Services.\nIt also includes determining how our customers prefer to view certain kinds of programming when they use our Services, such as whether they like to watch certain programs live, or if they prefer to view them on demand, on mobile devices, or online.\nOur business partners may compile this information into reports with aggregated and anonymous statistics that are then made commercially available (for example, a ratings report that indicates what percentage of viewers watched a particular program live vs.\non-demand).\nXfinity Stream includes Nielsen\u2019s proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, like Nielsen\u2019s television ratings.\nBy visiting www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy, users can access more information about the measurement software and learn about their choices with regard to Nielsen\u2019s measurement.\nThird-Party Apps and Partners When you use a third-party app through devices that are part of the Services, you are directing us to share certain information with the provider of the app, including but not limited to information needed to run the app and play the selected content.\nWhen using third-party apps, you are interacting with the third-party app directly, and their privacy policies and terms of service apply.\nFor more information, please visit https://my.xfinity.com/privacy/providers.\nCertain apps may also run using technology provided by Metrological, a Comcast company, whose privacy practices are described at https://www.metrological.com/privacypolicy.\nPublic Safety Authorities If you have our Xfinity Voice service, Comcast will disclose your name and contact information to public safety authorities such as 911/E911 and related emergency services.\nDirectory Services, Assistance, and Caller ID <p>Your name, address, and telephone number may be sent to publishers to be printed in directories and posted in online directories.\nOnce that information is printed or posted online, it is outside of our control and may be sorted or repackaged and made available again in different formats by anyone, including data aggregators, for a variety of purposes, including marketing.\nFor a fee, you can choose to have a nonpublished number, which means that Comcast will not provide your name, address, and telephone number for publishing in the phone book and online directories.\nYou can also choose to have a published number, but choose the \"omit address feature,\" which means we will not provide your street address for publishing in the phone book and online directories.\nIf initiating service online, select \"non-published\" option, otherwise call 1-800-XFINITY to sign up.</p>\n<p>We may also make your number, name, and address available to directory assistance (411) providers.\nIf you have a nonpublished number, Comcast will not make your number available through directory assistance.\nComcast may still share your name and address with the 411 provider when specified by law (but the provider is not authorized to share your (non-published number).</p>\n<p>Please note: While the non-published feature will keep your name, address, and telephone number out of printed and online directories over which Comcast exercises control, even a non-published phone number may exist in databases not controlled by Comcast \u2013 if, for example, your present telephone number or address was previously published under your name, or if you provided this information to businesses or government agencies.\nOne way to help protect your privacy may be to request assignment of a new telephone number (with which your name has not previously been associated).\nYou may also want to activate Caller ID Blocking or select the do-not-call option.</p>\n<p>Caller ID provides your name and telephone number to the person you are calling \u2013 even if you have a nonpublished number.\nPer Line Caller ID Blocking will automatically block Caller ID for all calls you make from your registered telephone number and can be activated by calling 1-800-XFINITY.\nPer Call Caller ID Blocking will block name and number Caller ID on a per-call basis and can be activated by dialing *86 before each call you want to block.</p> Potential Purchasers of our Business If we enter into a potential or actual merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, then information about you and your subscription will, in most cases, be shared or transferred as part of the transaction.\nThis includes information that personally identifies you.\nIf this Policy will be changed as a result of such a transaction, you should refer below under \"Changes to the Privacy Policy.\" Government Entities When Required by Law or To Protect Comcast and Others <p>There are times when we may be required by law to disclose information about you to third parties.\nThis may happen with or without your consent, and with or without notice, in compliance with the terms of valid legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to our Xfinity Video service, Comcast may be required to disclose information that personally identifies you to a governmental entity in response to a court order.\nIn this case, the Cable Act requires that you be given the opportunity to appear in a court proceeding to contest any claims made in support of the court order, and the governmental entity must offer clear and convincing evidence that you are reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity and that the information sought would be material evidence in the case.\nFor more information, see \"Your Rights and Our Limitations Under Federal Laws.\"</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to the Xfinity Internet, Voice, Mobile, or Home security and automation Services, Comcast may be required to disclose information that personally identifies you to a governmental entity in response to a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, depending on the type of information sought.\nWe are usually prohibited from notifying you of any such disclosures by the terms of the legal process.</p>\n<p>A non-governmental entity, such as a civil litigant, can seek information that personally identifies you or your use of the Xfinity Video, Internet, or Voice Services only pursuant to a court order, and we are required by the Cable Act to notify you of such court order.\nIf Comcast is required to give information that personally identifies you to a private third party in response to a civil court order for these or other Services, we will notify you prior to making such disclosure unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p>\n<p>We may also disclose information that personally identifies you as permitted by law and without your consent when it is necessary to protect our customers, employees, or property.\nin emergency situations.\nor to enforce our rights under our terms of service and policies.</p>\n</ul> How We Protect Your Information <p>We follow industry-standard practices to secure the information we collect to prevent the unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of any personal information we collect and maintain.\nThese security practices include technical, administrative, and physical safeguards, which may vary, depending on the type and sensitivity of the information.\nAlthough we take the responsibility of safeguarding your personal information seriously, no security measures are 100% effective and we cannot guarantee that these practices will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information.\nComcast also takes additional steps to increase the security and reliability of customer communications.\nWe do not read your outgoing or incoming email, file attachments, video mail, private chat, or instant messages.\nHowever, we (along with our service providers) use software and hardware tools to help prevent and block \"spam\" emails, viruses, spyware, and other harmful or unwanted communications and programs from being sent and received over Comcast.net email and the Comcast Services.\nTo help protect you and the Services against these harmful or unwanted communications and programs, these tools may automatically scan your emails, video mails, instant messages, file attachments, and other files and communications.\nWe do not use these tools for marketing or advertising.</p> How Long We Keep Your Information <p>We keep your personal information for different lengths of time depending on the type of information and the business and legal requirements.\nFor example, if you are a customer, we keep information that personally identifies you as long as you subscribe to one or more of our Services.\nIf you no longer subscribe to a Service, we still may need that information for business and legal requirements, such as to protect against fraud, calculate taxes, or respond to legal requests.\nOther information is deleted automatically after a set period of time, often set by law, unless we are legally required to hold it longer, such as for pending litigation.\nWe destroy, de-identify, or anonymize the information when it is no longer needed in identifiable form.</p> The Choices You Have to Control Our Use of Personal Information <p>You have many choices about how we communicate with you and how we use or share your information.\nYou can manage these settings in the Xfinity Privacy Preferences Center.\nIf you change your mind, you can update your preferences anytime.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<p>Learn more about your privacy choices.</p> For your convenience, we have created the Xfinity Privacy Preferences Center where you can manage: <p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your account communications and notifications</li>\n<li>Your marketing calls, texts, and direct mail preferences</li>\n<li>Your preference for door-to-door sales calls</li>\n<li>Promotional or commercial emails Comcast may send to you</li>\n<li>Personalized advertising for third-party products and services based on your interests</li>\n</ul> You can review your options, get more information about the types of marketing activities you can opt out of, and make your choices.\nIf you change your mind, you can return any time to update your preferences.\nSome of the selections are tied to customer accounts and may require you to sign into your Xfinity My Account.\nWe understand that sometimes you may want to speak to a Comcast representative who can assist you with your choices.\nYou can contact Comcast at 1-800-XFINITY and ask us to put your name on our internal company \"do not call,\" \"do not mail,\" or \"do not knock\" list.\n</ul> How to Access and Correct the Information in our Records <p>Part of our commitment to transparency includes giving our customers access to the personally identifiable information we have about them.\nIf you subscribe to Xfinity Services, you have the ability to see and correct your personally identifiable information through the My Account or Xfinity Home portals.</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights described in the \u201cSpecial Information Regarding California Residents\u2019 Privacy Rights\u201d section of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<p>Learn more about how to access personally identifiable customer information</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to an Xfinity Service, you may correct or update information by visiting the My Account portal or by contacting us as described below.\nIf you are an Xfinity Home customer, you can visit the subscriber portal at xfinity.com/xhportal anytime.\nWe will correct our records once we have verified that the changes you request are proper.</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to Xfinity TV, Internet, or Voice services and would like to see your own personally identifiable information, you may do so at your local Comcast office.\nTo do so, please contact us by mail at the address below or by phone at 1-800-XFINITY, giving us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for review, and to arrange an appointment during regular business hours.\nYou will need to have proper identification and will only be able to see the personally identifiable information in your account and no other account.</p>\n<p>If you make a written request for a copy of your Xfinity Voice or Mobile CPNI, we will provide you with the relevant information we have by mailing it to your account address, or to any person authorized by you, if we reasonably believe the request is valid.\nHowever, subscribers to our Xfinity Voice and Mobile Services should be aware that we generally do not provide them with records of any inbound or outbound calls or other records that we do not furnish in the ordinary course of business (for example, as part of a bill) or which are available only from our archives, without valid legal process such as a court order.\nIn addition, we cannot correct any errors in customer names, addresses, or telephone numbers appearing in, or omitted from, our or our vendors\u2019 directory lists until the next available publication of those directory lists.\nFurther, we may have no control over information appearing in the directory lists or directory assistance services of directory publishers or directory assistance providers that are not owned by us.</p>\n<p>Comcast reserves the right to charge you for the reasonable cost of retrieving and photocopying any information or documents that you request, where permitted by law.</p>\n</ul> Your Rights and Our Limitations Under Federal Laws <p>The federal Cable Act imposes limitations on our collection and sharing of information that personally identifies you when you subscribe to Services that use the facilities of the Comcast cable system.\nThe Communications Act imposes restrictions on our use and sharing of CPNI when you use Services that are deemed telecommunications services.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<p>Learn more about your rights and our limitations under federal laws</p> The Cable Act and Personally Identifiable Information <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to comply with Section 631 of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, (the \u201cCable Act\u201d).\nThe Cable Act permits Comcast to use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information about you.\nPersonally identifiable information is information that identifies you specifically.\nit does not include de-identified, anonymous, aggregate, or other data that does not identify you.\nWe may collect personally identifiable information when it is necessary to render cable services or other services to you and to detect unauthorized reception or use of the services.\nWe may use the cable system to collect personally identifiable information about you for additional purposes with your prior written or electronic consent.\nThe Cable Act also permits Comcast to disclose personally identifiable information if the disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct a legitimate business activity related to, the cable service or other services provided to you.\nrequired by law or legal process.\nor limited to your name and address, subject to your opt-out consent.\nThe frequency of any disclosure of personally identifiable information varies in accordance with our business needs and activities as described in this Policy.</p>\n<p>If you believe that you have been aggrieved by any act of ours in violation of the Cable Act or other applicable laws, we encourage you to contact us directly at Comcast_Privacy@comcast.com in order to resolve your question or concern.\nYou may also enforce the limitations imposed on us by the Cable Act as applicable with respect to your personally identifiable information through a civil lawsuit seeking damages, attorneys\u2019 fees, and litigation costs.\nOther rights

hours.\n</p>\n<p> If you violate this Agreement, or if you fail to notify us of unauthorized use in a timely manner, we may terminate the Services and recover damages.\nSince it would be difficult, if not impossible, to precisely calculate our lost revenue from unauthorized Services or tampering, you agree to pay $500.00 per device used to receive unauthorized Services as liquidated damages.\nThese liquidated damages are in addition to our cost to replace any altered, damaged, or unreturned Xfinity Equipment, or other equipment owned by us, including any incidental costs.\nThe unauthorized

under U.S.\ncopyright law have been infringed by any material on the Comcast Web Services, you may take advantage of certain provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \"DMCA\") by sending Comcast's authorized agent a notification of claimed infringement that satisfies the requirements of the DMCA.\nUpon Comcast's receipt of a satisfactory notice of claimed infringement, Comcast will respond expeditiously either directly or indirectly (i) to remove the allegedly infringing work(s) from the Comcast Web Services or (ii) to disable access to the work(s).\nIn accordance with the DMCA, it is Comcast's policy to reserve the right to terminate access to the Comcast Web Services (or any part of those services) for any user who is either found to infringe third-party copyright or other intellectual property rights, including repeat infringers, or who Comcast, in its sole discretion, believes is infringing these rights.\nComcast may terminate access to the Comcast Web Services at any time with or without notice for any affected customer or user.\nIf the affected user believes in good faith that the allegedly infringing works have been removed or blocked by mistake or misidentification, then that person may send a counter notification to Comcast.\nUpon Comcast's receipt of a counter notification that satisfies the requirements of DMCA, Comcast will provide a copy

19.\nBinding Arbitration <p>\n<b>a.\nPurpose.</b> If you are a user of or subscriber to Xfinity TV, Xfinity Voice, and/or Xfinity Internet, please refer to the Binding Arbitration section of the Comcast Agreement for Residential Services, which applies to any Dispute (as defined in that agreement) between you and Comcast for those services, available here: http://www.comcast.com/Corporate/Customers/Policies/Policies.html.\nIf you are not a subscriber to these services, any Dispute (as defined below in these Terms) involving you and Comcast shall be resolved through individual arbitration.\nIn arbitration, there is no judge or jury and there is less discovery and appellate review than in court.\nThis Section 19 (the \"Arbitration Provision\") shall be broadly interpreted.</p>\n<p>\n<b>b.\nDefinitions.</b> The term \"Dispute\" means any claim or controversy related to the Comcast Web Services, including but not limited to any and all: (1) claims for relief and theories of liability, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, negligence, statute, regulation, ordinance, or otherwise.\n(2) claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement.\n(3) claims that arise after the expiration or termination of these Terms.\nand (4) claims that are the subject of purported class action litigation.\nAs used in this Arbitration Provision, \"Comcast\" means Comcast and any of its predecessors, successors, assigns, parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, and \u201cyou\u201d means you and any users or beneficiaries of your access to the Comcast Web Services.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Disputes relating to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this arbitration provision will not be subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<b>c.\nRight to Sue in Small Claims Court.</b> Notwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision, either you or Comcast may elect to bring an individual action in small claims court if the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person and if the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.</p>\n<p>\n<b>d.\nRight to Opt Out.</b> IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES YOU MAY DECLINE TO HAVE YOUR DISPUTES WITH COMCAST ARBITRATED BY NOTIFYING COMCAST IN WRITING WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE LATER OF YOUR FIRST ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE COMCAST WEB SERVICES, OR APRIL 5, 2013, BY VISITING WWW.COMCAST.COM/WEBARBOPTOUT, OR BY MAIL TO COMCAST 1701 JOHN F.\nKENNEDY BLVD., PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103-2838, ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT/ARBITRATION.\nYOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO COMCAST MUST INCLUDE YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND ACCOUNT NUMBER (IF YOU ARE A COMCAST SUBSCRIBER) OR TELEPHONE NUMBER (IF YOU ARE NOT A COMCAST SUBSCRIBER) AS WELL AS A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH COMCAST THROUGH ARBITRATION.\nYOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH COMCAST OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY COMCAST.\nIF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY OPTED OUT OF ARBITRATION WITH COMCAST, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.</p>\n<p>\n<b>e.\nInitiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</b> The party initiating the arbitration proceeding may open a case with the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll free number (1-800-778-7879).\nYou may deliver any required or desired notice to Comcast by mail to Comcast, 1701 JFK Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19103-2838 \u2013 ATTN: LEGAL DEPARTMENT.</p>\n<p>\n<b>f.\nArbitration Procedures.</b> This Arbitration Provision shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\nArbitrations shall be administered by AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) as modified by the version of this Arbitration Provision that is in effect when you notify Comcast about your Dispute.\nYou can obtain the AAA Rules from the AAA by visiting its website (www.adr.org) or calling its toll-free number (1-800-778-7879).\nIf there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the rest of this Agreement, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.\nIf there is a conflict between this Arbitration Provision and the AAA rules, this Arbitration Provision shall govern.\nIf the AAA will not administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization.\nIf the parties cannot agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will administer a proceeding under this Arbitration Provision as written applying the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nA single arbitrator will resolve the Dispute.\nUnless you and Comcast agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the area where you receive or received any of the Web Services from Comcast.\nor, if you reside in a location outside of the area where you receive or received any of the Web Services, then the arbitration hearing will take place at a location convenient to you in the county where you reside.\nThe arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect customer account information and other confidential or proprietary information.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision that explains the arbitrator\u2019s essential findings and conclusions.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties only if necessary for purposes of enforcing the arbitrator\u2019s award.\nAn arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.</p>\n<p>\n<b>g.\nWaiver of Class Actions and Collective Relief.</b> THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON A CLASS ACTION, JOINT OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL), OTHER SUBSCRIBERS, OR OTHER PERSONS.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTY\u2019S CLAIM.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY.\nTHE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.\nTHIS WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CANNOT BE SEVERED FROM IT.\nTHE REMAINING PORTIONS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION ARE NOT ESSENTIAL PARTS OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CAN BE SEVERED FROM IT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION.</p>\n<p>\n<b>h.\nArbitration Fees and Costs.</b> If your claim seeks more than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA\u2019s fees and costs will be governed by the AAA rules.\nIf your claims seek less than $75,000 in the aggregate, the payment of the AAA\u2019s fees and costs will be Comcast\u2019s responsibility.\nHowever, if the arbitrator finds that your Dispute was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the payment of the AAA\u2019s fees and costs shall be governed by the AAA Rules and you shall reimburse Comcast for all fees and costs that were your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nYou may hire an attorney to represent you in arbitration.\nYou are responsible for your attorneys\u2019 fees and additional costs and may only recover your attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the arbitration to the extent that you could in court if the arbitration is decided in your favor.\nNotwithstanding anything in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, Comcast will pay all fees and costs that it is required by law to pay.</p>\n<p>\n<b>i.\nSurvival.</b> This Arbitration Provision will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.</p> 20.\nGeneral Legal Terms <p>The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Comcast and govern your use of the Comcast Web Services, and completely replace any prior agreements between you and Comcast in relation to the Comcast Web Services.</p>\n<p>WHETHER IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.</p>\n<p>Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, Comcast and its suppliers reserve the right to delete all your data, files, electronic messages, or other information that is stored on Comcast's or its suppliers' servers or systems.\nComcast shall have no responsibility whatsoever for the loss of any such data.</p>\n<p>You agree that Comcast may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Comcast Web Services.</p>\n<p>You agree that if Comcast does not exercise or enforce any contractual or legal right or remedy to which it is entitled, this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Comcast's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Comcast.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Comcast Corporation is the parent shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms and that these other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them.\nOther than this, no other person or entity shall be third-party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>\n<p>The Terms, and your relationship with Comcast under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nBy using the Comcast Web Services, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in all disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or Comcast Web Services that are not subject to the Arbitration Provision above.</p> 21.\nSpecial Note About Content Provided as Part of Your Xfinity TV Subscription.\n<p>If you are a residential subscriber to Xfinity TV and Xfinity Internet, you may be entitled to use your Internet connection to access certain video content that is related to your Xfinity TV subscription
