communications: and</li>\n<li>Unusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription use, for example, regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers in a short period of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination.\nSkype may at its option, terminate or suspend its relationship with you, and your use of any Skype product immediately if it determines you are using the product contrary to this FUP.</p> Subscriptions <p>Subject to this FUP, Skype\u2019s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium,

a limit of 4 hours per individual video call.\nOnce these limits have been reached, the video will switch off and the call will convert to an audio call.\nIf a participant of a group video call is not

products, websites and services provided by Microsoft and some Microsoft partners.\n<ul>\n<li>i.\n<strong>Creating an Account.</strong> You can create a Microsoft account by signing up online.\nYou agree not to use any false, inaccurate or misleading information when signing up for your Microsoft account.\nIn some cases, a third party, like your Internet service provider, may have assigned a Microsoft account to you.\nIf you received your Microsoft account from a third party, the third party may have additional rights over your account, like the ability to access or delete your Microsoft account.\nPlease review any additional terms the third party provided you, as Microsoft has no responsibility regarding these additional terms.\nIf you create a Microsoft account on behalf of an entity, such as your business or employer, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these Terms.\nYou cannot transfer your Microsoft account credentials to another user or entity.\nTo protect your account, keep your account details and password confidential.\nYou are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Microsoft account.</li>\n<li>ii.\n<strong>Account Use.</strong> You must use your Microsoft account to keep it active.\nThis means you must sign in at least once in a two-year period to keep your Microsoft account, and associated Services, active, unless a longer period is provided in the Microsoft account activity policy at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2086738 or in an offer for a paid portion of the Services.\nIf you don\u2019t sign in during this time, we will assume your Microsoft account is inactive and will close it for you.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 for the consequences of a closed Microsoft account.\nYou must sign into your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive (separately) at least once in a one-year period, otherwise we will close your Outlook.com inbox and your OneDrive for you.\nYou must sign into the Xbox Services at least once in a five-year period to keep the gamertag associated with your Microsoft account.\nIf we reasonably suspect that your Microsoft account is at risk of being used by a third party fraudulently (for example, as a result of an account compromise), Microsoft may suspend your account until you can reclaim ownership.\nBased on the nature of the compromise, we may be required to disable access to some or all of Your Content.\nIf you are having trouble accessing your Microsoft account, please visit this website: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238656.</li>\n<li>iii.\n<strong>Kids and Accounts.</strong> By creating a Microsoft account or using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by these

whether you have reached the age of majority where you live, or do not understand this section, please ask your parent or legal guardian for help.\nIf you are the parent or legal guardian of a minor, you and the minor accept and agree to be bound by these Terms and are responsible for all use of the Microsoft account or Services, including purchases, whether the minor\u2019s account is now open or

your mind.\nAfter that 60-day period, your Microsoft account will be closed.\nPlease see section 4.a.iv.2 below for an explanation as to what happens when your Microsoft account is closed.\nLogging

Microsoft account to access the Services stops immediately.\nSecond, we\u2019ll delete Data or Your Content associated with your Microsoft account or will otherwise disassociate it from you and your Microsoft account (unless we are required by law to keep it, return it, or transfer it to you or a third party identified by you).\nYou should have a regular backup plan as Microsoft won\u2019t be

purchase a Service, then these payment terms apply to your purchase and you agree to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a.\n<strong>Charges.</strong> If there is a charge associated with a portion of the Services, you agree to pay that charge.\nThe price stated for the Services excludes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements, unless stated otherwise.\nThe price for Skype paid products includes a charge for the product and a charge for taxes.\nYou are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges.\nTaxes are calculated based on your location at the time your Microsoft account was registered.\nWe may suspend or cancel the Services if we do not receive an on time, full payment from you.\nSuspension or cancellation of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of your account and its content.\nConnecting to the Internet via a corporate or other private network that masks your location may cause charges to be different from those displayed for your actual location.</li>\n<li>b.\n<strong>Your Billing Account.</strong> To pay the charges for a Service, you will be asked to provide a payment method at the time you sign up for that Service.\nYou can access and change your billing information and payment method on the Microsoft account management website (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618281) and for Skype by signing
