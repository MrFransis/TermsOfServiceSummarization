Click here.<br>h4.Last Updated: 08/25/18</p>Code of Conduct Introduction<p>The forums and website are here to provide you with a friendly environment where you can discuss ideas, give advice, and converse about other aspects of e621 with fellow members.\nThe community forums and primary website are at their best when participants treat their fellow posters with respect and courtesy.\nTherefore, we ask that you conduct yourself in a civilized manner while participating in these forums.</p>\n<p>The guidelines and rules listed below explain what behavior is expected of you and what behavior you can expect from other community members.\nNote that the following guidelines are not exhaustive, and may not address all manner of offensive behavior.\nAs such, the forum moderators shall have full discretion to address any behavior that they feel is inappropriate.\nAlso, suspension or banishment from the posting section of the website will always result in the same regard to forum access.\nYour access to the forums and website is a \u2018privilege\u2019, and not a \u2018right\u2019.\nWe reserve the right to suspend your access to the forums and website at any time for reasons that include, but are not necessarily limited to, your failure to abide by these guidelines.\nIn addition, these guidelines are not enforced on the e621 IRC channel, or similar off-site social channels.\nLikewise, any guidelines in use for the e621 IRC channels, or similar off-site social channels will not affect your access on the forums or website.\nPlease note that the application of these rules varies based on the section of the website it is posted.\nSome things are OK to be as part of a 'Post' submission to the website, whereas it would not be OK as part of a 'Forum Thread'.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to evaluate each incident on a case by case basis.\nThe action we take may be more lenient or more severe than those listed under each category:</p>Table of Contents<p>Abuse of Site Tools<br>Advertising<br>Age Restrictions<br>Backseat Moderating<br>Bestiality<br>(Refusal to Use) Blacklist<br>Circumventing a Suspension / Ban<br>Creepy

Trolling<br>Tagging Abuse / Tagging Vandalism</p>Glossary<p>Post: An image or other content uploaded to e621, on the posts section of the website.\nNot to be confused with a 'forum post'.\n<br>Comment: A textual comment made on a Post, on the posts section of the website, or blips in the blip section.<br>Forum Thread: A 'thread' of comments on a single subject, on the forums section of the website.<br>Forum Post: A comment made on a Forum Thread.</p>Code of Conduct Policy Categories<p>\n<strong>Abuse of Site Tools</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using any of the site tools, such as Flag for Deletion, ticket reporting system, takedowns, notes, or any other site tool in a fashion that can be construed as disruptive, spamming, or defamatory</li>\n<li>Putting gibberish in any of the description fields</li>\n<li>Repeatedly submitting invalid, incorrect, or unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>Repeatedly submitting username change requests</li>\n<li>Using any of the site tools to \u201cbackseat moderate\u201d</li>\n<li>Reporting forum posts, threads, comments, blips, or any other site media that is older than 6 months</li>\n<li>Voting with multiple accounts on the same posts or comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It should be noted that if a user reports a post, thread, comment, or any other site media that is older than 6 months, but contains a publicly visible malicious link, that they will be exempt from this rule</p>\n<p>In addition, if a person who is submitting content wishes it for it to be removed, for any reason, within 48 hours, that request will be honored.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is aimed at making sure trolls and other disrespectful people do not detract or harm the look of the website by putting in requests for admin action with no clear, real, or valid basis.\nAn example is someone who issues multiple username change requests in a short period of time.\nAnother is someone repeatedly reporting another user\u2019s comments when they didn\u2019t break any rules.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any non-beneficial, non-approved related businesses, organizations, or websites</li>\n<li>Can be linked with Spamming or Trolling if it is used multiple times in a short period of time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are the content creator of a given post, it is acceptable and encouraged for you to advertise products or services you may offer, in the 'description' field of your post.\nIn the future, we hope to offer a more streamlined and useful system for the promotion of your own work.<br>If you wish to promote your product or service, please contact ads@dragonfru.it with any questions/approvals<br>Visit https://e621.net/forum/show/10410 for more information </p>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to prevent people from using e621\u2019s forums and posts from being a source of income/traffic for their unrelated business.\nIf someone would like to advertise on the website, we encourage them to contact us so we can try and get them better exposure.\nThis also allows them a place to go if they want to pay for a banner on the website.\nNot all ads have to be paid for either, and in some cases, we allow businesses or projects to receive free promotions in order to do good for the community.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Age Restrictions</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: Permanent</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any persons under the age of 18, or as determined by local laws</li>\n<li>Any comment or evidence of being under the age of 18</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your account is your responsibility.\nIf your account was breached/hacked, then you can dispute the problem and we will look into it on a case-by-case basis<br>If found to violate this rule, the account may be banned until the user\u2019s 18th birthday.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Even though different states/provinces/territories have different rules, e621.net\u2019s management and service office is located in Arizona, USA and it is by those laws that we are responsible for.\nWe cannot knowingly allow any minors to view pornographic content, so we must be proactive in preventing this underage access.\nThis includes accounts that are either legally or illegally accessed by minors.\nFurthermore, we require photo identification and proof of someone turning 18 in order to release access to their account.\nSuch proof can be sent to the senior management group to determine authenticity, and must include the user\u2019s face as well as the government or state issued identification, or other applicable document.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Backseat Moderating</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 to 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Implying moderator/administrator privileges where none exist</li>\n<li>Non-administrator/moderator/staff threatening to use disciplinary actions against another user</li>\n<li>Demanding, ordering, or otherwise stating to an administrator/moderator/staff certain administrative actions to be taken against another user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>This is aimed at preventing non-administrators from attempting to enforce the rules of the website.\nIt does not matter if the user was correct, or incorrect, in their actions.\nMost, if not all, users are largely unaware of the daily dealings with the admin staff and would not be aware of any pending changes or discussions.\nIn addition, users cannot demand an admin ban someone, report a comment, take down art, or any of the moderator/administrator actions.\nHowever, they can request that we look into something, so that we may perform our own research and resolve it without bias.\nExample: Sending a PM to an admin telling them to ban a user, with or without a reason.\nExample: Sending in a ticket citing a rule violation, then stating that if it wasn\u2019t done to their satisfaction, they want all of their art removed from the site.</em>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Bestiality</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating a post, forum post, or thread that is an inappropriate reference to real-life bestiality, sexual relations, or bodily functions</li>\n<li>Linking or commenting on a website that promotes material that contains inappropriate references to real-life bestiality, sexual relations, or bodily functions</li>\n<li>Linking to explicit, real-life material involving animal genitalia or animals mating</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>The two keywords here are \u201creal-life\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d.\nObviously, there are going to be bestiality references, and the nature of our site has to be more lenient about it than most.\nHowever, the moment someone mentions or posts about a real-life animal and makes sexual comment about it, then they fall under this.\nNo personal discussion.\nIf someone makes a sexual reference to a drawn or imaginary animal, that is fine.\nExample: I tried to get the horse penis to be realistic in size (okay) Man, I fucked my neighbor\u2019s horse so hard last night (not okay).</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Refusal to Use Blacklist</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 to 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating posts, threads, or comments that complain about artwork that can be blacklisted</li>\n<li>Wrongfully claiming lack of knowledge about the blacklist system to avoid punishment from the previous rule</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to reduce or eliminate the complaints that users make about seeing a certain type of content on the site.\nIf a user chooses, or refuses, to utilize the blacklist, but continues to complain about content they find offensive or unsatisfactory, then this rule may be enforced.\nAdditionally, if a user finds a post that is incorrectly tagged and willingly chooses to complain about seeing it instead of placing the correct tag, this rule may also be enforced then.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Circumventing a Suspension / Ban</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: Permanent</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Posting anything on another account</li>\n<li>Having someone post on your behalf</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If someone is found to have violated this rule, they may be banned with no appeal, regardless of previous disciplinary action<br>Alternate accounts are generally okay, so long as they are neither used to evade a suspension/ban, nor to abuse the vote tools</p>\n<p>\n<em>Fairly self-explanatory.\nIf someone gets Suspended or Banned, and they try to go on a friend\u2019s account, or alt account, and post anyway, that account gets banned as well.\nThe other side to this is if they were under a short-term suspension and they go around to circumvent it, that short-term suspension becomes a permanent ban.\nIf a user does this, but acts in such a way as to not continue the actions that got them banned, then an admin may choose not to enforce this rule, under the guise of helping the greater good.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Creepy Comments</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating forum posts, threads, or comments that cause an unpleasant feeling of fear or unease, or are sexually inappropriate</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to ensure that users do not express their personal fetishes/desires publicly.\nUsers have the right, within realistic expectations, to browse comfortably without unneeded or unnecessary commentary of those who wish to express their desires.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Disregard of the Site Administration</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failure to abide by direct instructions by an administrator, moderator, and/or employee of Bad Dragon or Dragonfruit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to make sure that any instructions given by the staff of e621 are followed, but is mainly for minor things that are annoying or disrupting.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Distribution of Real-Life Personal Information</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Releasing or assisting in releasing any real-life information about other members or employees of Bad Dragon, Dragonfruit, or e621, or anyone else</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If someone is found to have violated this rule, they may be banned with no appeal, regardless of previous disciplinary action</p>\n<p>\n<em>Self-explanatory for the most part, but any attempt to reveal personal information, whether true or not, about someone will qualify.\nExample: I heard EDFDarkAngel1 lives in Phoenix (okay) I heard that EDFDarkAngel1 drives a red 1961 Ferrari GT California (not okay).</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Extreme Sexuality / Violence</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linking to websites that refer to extreme real-life violent sexual activity</li>\n<li>Linking to websites that refer to extreme real-life violence</li>\n<li>Linking to websites that refer to extreme kinks and/or fetishes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Videos of rape, snuff, executions, and similar material all fall under this category.<br>Linking to generic pornographic material is still fine as long as it doesn't break any other rules.</p>\n<p>\n<em>The intent is to prevent real-life violent content from websites we do not control from being exposed to users of e621.\nThe rule specifically mentions links to other websites since we control the content here.\nAs to what defines as \u201cextreme kink\u201d is going to be judged on a case-by-case basis.\nHowever, if it is ruled that one thing is extreme kink, it must be consistent in that ruling.\nFor example, if you consider scat as an extreme kink (not saying that we should), all posts and comments that contain scat should be removed as well, so judge wisely.\nExample: a post of a drawn character getting graphically and brutally slaughtered (okay).\nA forum thread linking to 4chan\u2019s /c/ thread (not okay)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Harassing or Defamatory</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insultingly refer to any individuals, including users, site staff, or Bad Dragon employees</li>\n<li>Performing actions which result in ongoing harassment to any individuals, including users, site staff, or Bad Dragon employees</li>\n<li>Using a User-requested ticket to publicly mock them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will be rendered against intent as well as action.\nThe idea is to prevent a member from being uncomfortable in the forums or on the site.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to stop the insults and offensive comments that some people use.\nIf someone makes a public comment, and someone finds it offensive, it will most likely fall under this.\nExample: I don\u2019t agree with the admins (okay) The admins here are fucking stupid (not okay)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Illegal Activities or Drugs</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 to 7 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forum threads or comments that references to abusing illegal drugs</li>\n<li>Forum threads or comments that references to performing illegal activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Admitting to partaking in arson, bestiality, kidnapping, manslaughter or other similar serious crimes will lead to the permanent closure of your account.<br>Being a convicted felon for any of the above crimes may also lead to the permanent closure of your account.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to make sure we are not promoting drug use or other illegal activities in commentary form.\nFor example it is okay if someone posts a picture of someone shooting up, but it is not okay if someone comments that they like to shoot up.\nWe do not want anyone looking at the comments and thinking drug abuse or other illegal activities are acceptable (because someone else is doing it).\nExample: a post where a strung-out character has a needle in their arm (okay) Comment in the post\u2019s thread: Oh wow, that reminds me of me an hour ago! (not okay)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Impersonating an Employee or Moderator</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: Permanent</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passing yourself off as a current or past employee of Bad Dragon, Dragonfruit, or e621, especially to post false information</li>\n<li>Passing yourself off as a current or past moderator of Bad Dragon, Dragonfruit, or e621, especially to post false information</li>\n<li>Passing yourself off as another user to harass or besmirch them or their reputation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Passing yourself off as anyone else is not acceptable, and if it is someone who has been suspended or banned, it may lead to your account being banned</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is intended to make sure that all official information comes from admin accounts, and not someone else.\nThis includes posting official information on a friend\u2019s account, or even an alternate one.\nMake sure that if you are posting information, you do it from your administrator or moderator account.\nThis also goes for ban-evaders, if someone tries to impersonate them, we will assume it is them trying to evade the ban.\nExample: Hey everyone, it\u2019s EDFDarkAngel1 on a friend\u2019s account.\nI wanted to tell you about some of the upcoming site changes\u2026</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Major Religions, Religious Figures, Political Parties, or Political Figures</strong>\n<br>\n<em>Suggested Suspension Length: 3 days</em>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any discussion in forum posts, threads, or comments regarding major religions

do encourage free speech and we have no problem with someone saying \u201cthank God\u201d or \u201cJesus blesses you\u201d, we have to draw the line at an actual discussion, as it often leads to passionate and heated debate and a general distraction from what is ultimately a furry art archive.\nThe same goes for politics, we know that people want to talk about it, and often do, but there are places for that and they are not here.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Name Changes</strong>\n<br>This category includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Common names are not reserved, if you give up a common name through a

invalid/disruptive tags, or any tags that could be considered as defamatory or spam</li>\n<li>Using Unicode in tags, with the exception of foreign artist/character names</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>The purpose for this is to prevent users from abusing the system that for easy searching/indexing of the posts.\nThis enforces the site\u2019s \u201cTag What You See\u201d rule, in that you cannot tag an image as \u201cmale\u201d or \u201cfemale\u201d unless there is visible evidence of that.\nEven if another site has the same character with better visibility of its gender, that post uniquely must contain those elements.\nMistagging, adding invalid tags, or removing valid tags are not punishable for a one-time offense, but they will be disciplined if they produce a pattern of tagging abuse.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>\n<br>Repeatedly violating any area of the e621 Community and Forums Code of Conduct, including the areas detailed above, will often result in banishment from the forums and site.<br>This policy is not language-restrictive.\nLanguage that falls under this policy will always be subject to the repercussions listed, whether it is inappropriate

thousands of other people who share different experiences and come from vastly different backgrounds.\nWhile certain language and images may or may not be offensive to you, consider the fact that the same language and images may have a completely different effect on someone else.\n</p>User Ranks<p>When first creating an account, you will automatically be set as Member.\nThrough tagging/posting contributions to the site, as well as constructive behavior, you may get promoted by an administrator.\nIf you feel that you should get promoted based on your efforts, you can contact the website administration via the Contact Us page and request it.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Member</em>: Can search up to six tags simultaneously.\nMust wait three days to edit tags, and a week to upload, vote, and

Conduct in one or more ways, disciplinary actions will be given from a site administrator in the form of a neutral or negative record.\nIt will contain the specific rule that was broken, and the offending post (or hyperlink to offending post).\nThis is a breakdown of how the disciplinary actions will work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notification (neutral record): This will serve as an advisement that you have violated the Code of Conduct.\n</li>\n<ul>\n<li>If you broke the Code of Conduct in multiple ways that warrant a Notification, everything will be summarized in a single record</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Warning (negative record): This will serve an official warning that you violated the Code of Conduct.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>If you broke the Code of Conduct in multiple ways that warrant a Warning, everything will be summarized in a single record</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Suspension (Ban): This is a temporary ban from the site and forums.</li>\n<ul>\n<li>If you committed an offense that warranted Suspension, and another one that warranted a Warning, you will only receive one negative record summarizing all offenses.\nTreat the Warnings as if they were part of the Suspension instead of as Warnings.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Permanent Ban (Perma Ban): This is a permanent ban from e621.net and all other affiliates.\nThis is reserved for repeated offenses and serious violations of the Code of Conduct</li>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wish to appeal your ban, you may contact the Community Manager</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Decay of Records:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any record for a suspension will be turned into a negative record after 6 months of no new infractions</li>\n<li>Any negative record will be turned into a neutral record after 6 months of no new infractions</li>\n<li>Any neutral record will be removed after 6 months of no new infractions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Permanent bans will never expire but may be appealed
