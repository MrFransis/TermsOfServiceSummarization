to provide secure its communications service, and does not collect or monetize your content.</p>\n<p>Your trust is important to us and we tirelessly work on improving our services and raising awareness about our products, which are designed to ensure our users\u2019 security and privacy.\nTo accomplish these goals, we use cookies that enable us to learn how our website visitors navigate

picture, audio and video messages.\nSenders control who can read their messages and when they expire.\nEncrypted messages are stored on our servers and are deleted after they are downloaded to the recipient\u2019s device(s).\nWe do not have plaintext copies of messages exchanged through our system or the keys to decrypt user content.\nWe can\u2019t read any of the messages sent through Wickr Messenger, nor do we know who our users are, or with whom they communicate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Wickr Pro&nbsp;</strong>is a separate collaboration platform that allows its customers to create secure professional networks within which to send messages and files.\nSenders control who can read their messages and when they expire.\nEncrypted messages are stored on our servers and are deleted after they are downloaded to the recipient\u2019s device(s).\nWe do not have plaintext copies of content exchanged through our system or the keys to decrypt user content.\nAs Wickr business tools are designed to be used within professional environment, each customer network is managed by the customer\u2019s administrator who can invite users within and outside of the enterprise.</p>\n<p>Wickr is committed to operating in an environment of complete transparency and to cooperating with law enforcement while respecting each individual\u2019s right to privacy.</p>\n<p>Wickr responds to valid legal process issued in compliance with U.S.\nlaw.\nRequests for user account information from U.S.\nlaw enforcement should be directed to Wickr through proper service of process.</p>\n<strong>Service of Process</strong>\n<p>Wickr accepts service of court orders, search warrants, and subpoenas for information by email from law enforcement and government agencies, provided that these legal requests are sent from an official government email address of the requesting agent.\nLaw enforcement and/or government agencies should submit legal requests directly from their official government email address to&nbsp;legal@wickr.com.</p>\n<strong>Private Information Requires a Subpoena or Court Order</strong>\n<p>Non-public information about Wickr users\u2019 accounts will not be released to law enforcement except in response to appropriate legal process such as a subpoena, court order, or other valid legal process.</p>\n<strong>Contents of Communications Are Not Available</strong>\n<p>Requests for the contents of communications require a valid search warrant from an agency with proper jurisdiction over Wickr.\nHowever, our response to such a request will reflect that the content is not stored on our servers or that, in very limited instances where a message has not yet been retrieved by the recipient, the content is encrypted data which is indecipherable.</p>\n<strong>What Must Be Included in Account Information Requests?</strong>\n<p>Law enforcement or government requests for user information must include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying information of the account for which information is requested, such as User ID or phone number (please note that phone numbers will only yield responsive information when the user has enabled ID Connection)</li>\n<li>A description of information being sought</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The descriptions should be as narrow and specific as possible in order to avoid misinterpretation and/or objections for overly broad requests.\nWickr will construe received requests narrowly to maintain users\u2019 privacy and ensure that any information disclosed does not exceed the scope of the request.</p>\n<p>Further, Wickr requires law enforcement and/or government agencies to include the following information so that requests for user information may be validated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requesting law enforcement/government agency</li>\n<li>Requesting agent name and badge/ID number</li>\n<li>Valid agency e-mail address and physical return address</li>\n<li>Phone number of requesting agent, including extension when applicable</li>\n<li>Response due date</li>\n<li>A copy of the court order, warrant, or subpoena</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Will Wickr Notify Users of Requests for Account Information?</strong>\n<p>Wickr\u2019s policy is to notify users of requests for their account information prior to disclosure including providing user with a copy of the request, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so or if there is danger of death or serious physical injury.\nAs soon as legally permitted to do so, we will notify our users of requests for their information.</p>\n<strong>What Information Does Wickr Store?</strong>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Wickr has the following information about user accounts on Wickr Messenger:</strong>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Date an account was created</li>\n<li>Type of device(s) on which such account was used</li>\n<li>Date of last use</li>\n<li>Total number of sent/received messages</li>\n<li>Number of external ID\u2019s (email addresses and phone numbers) connected to the account, but not the plaintext external IDs themselves</li>\n<li>Avatar image (if user elected to provide one)</li>\n<li>Limited records of recent changes to account settings such as adding or suspending a device (does not include message content or routing and delivery information)</li>\n<li>Wickr version number</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Wickr has the following information about user accounts on Wickr Pro:</strong>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Network affiliation</li>\n<li>Wickr Pro ID (email address)</li>\n<li>Phone number, if provided by network administrator as a second form of authentication</li>\n<li>Date an account was created</li>\n<li>Type of device(s) on which an account was used</li>\n<li>Date of last use</li>\n<li>Total number of sent/received messages</li>\n<li>Avatar image (if user elected to provide one)</li>\n<li>Limited records of recent changes to account settings such as adding or suspending a device (does not include message content or routing and delivery information)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wickr has the following information about network administrator accounts on Wickr Pro:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administrator ID (email address)</li>\n<li>Network membership</li>\n<li>Payment-related information</li>\n<li>Network-wide settings including limited records of recent changes to network settings (i.e.\nenabling or disabling federation)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>For Wickr Pro, the configuration of each network may vary depending on the enterprise needs.\nThus, the information Wickr may be able to provide in response to a lawful request for user information will vary as well.</em>\n</p>\n<strong>Emergency Disclosure Requests</strong>\n<p>Wickr may provide information to law enforcement in response to a valid emergency disclosure request.</p>\n<p>We review emergency disclosure requests on a case-by-case basis and evaluate them under applicable law (e.g., 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2702).\nIf we receive information that gives us a good-faith belief that there is an exigent emergency involving the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, we may provide information to law enforcement to prevent that harm, if we have it.</p>\n<p>Law enforcement officers can submit an emergency disclosure request via email:<strong>legal@wickr.com.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Emergency disclosure requests must be on law enforcement letterhead and include all of the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identity of the person who is in danger of death or serious physical injury;</li>\n<li>The nature of the emergency;</li>\n<li>Wickr ID (user name) of the subject account(s) whose information is necessary to prevent the emergency;</li>\n<li>The specific information requested and why that information is necessary to prevent the emergency;</li>\n<li>The signature of the submitting law enforcement officer.\nand</li>\n<li>Any other relevant details about the circumstances that we should take into account.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Preservation Requests</strong>\n<p>Upon receipt of a valid preservation request from law enforcement under applicable law, we will temporarily preserve the relevant account records for 90 days pending service of legal process.\nWe will only disclose preserved records upon receipt of valid legal process.</p>\n<p>Preservation requests should be on law enforcement letterhead, signed by the requesting official, and include a valid official email address.\nPreservation requests may be submitted via the methods described above.</p>\n<strong>Responding to Civil Subpoenas</strong>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Account Content</strong>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Federal law does not allow private parties to obtain account contents (e.g., messages, attachments, etc.) from electronic communication service providers through civil subpoenas.\nSee the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 2702.</p>\n<p>Parties to litigation may satisfy party and non-party discovery requirements by seeking the contents of an account directly from the user.</p>\n<p>Wickr does not preserve account content in response to a request from a private party.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Records</strong>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wickr may provide customer records in response to a valid subpoena issued by a federal or California or New York court where the requested information is indispensable to the case and not already within a party\u2019s possession.\nIt is Wickr\u2019s policy to give affected account holders prior notice before complying with such subpoenas.</p>\n<p>Parties seeking basic subscriber information must specifically identify accounts by Wickr ID.</p>\n<strong>Production of Records, Authentication</strong>\n<p>We provide responsive records in electronic format.\nWe reserve the right to seek reimbursement for the costs of producing records where appropriate.</p>\n<p>Wickr does not provide expert witness testimony.\nHowever, all substantive responses to legal process requests will be accompanied by a signed Certificate of Authenticity of Business Records, which should eliminate the need for the testimony of a custodian of records.</p>\n<strong>Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties</strong>\n<p>Wickr\u2019s policy is to promptly respond to requests that are issued via U.S.\ncourt upon proper service of process either by way of a mutual legal assistance treaty or letter rogatory.</p>\n<p>As a courtesy to international law enforcement agencies, we will review and respond to properly submitted preservation requests while the MLAT or letters rogatory process is underway.</p>", "created_at": "2021-05-13 09:51:53.425926", "updated_at": "2021-05-13 09:52:08.882914"}, {"id":

Wickr allows you to encrypt and send audio, video, voice, text messages and files, and conduct voice calls, so that you can communicate safely, securely, anonymously \u2014 and easily.</p>\n<p>\n<br>This document, our Privacy Policy, governs how Wickr (\u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cWickr\u201d) handles our users\u2019 (\u201cyou,\u201d \u201cyour,\u201d etc.) data both in the Wickr Me app itself (the \u201cWickr Me App\u201d or \u201cWickr Me\u201d) and on our website/servers (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d).\nThis policy does not cover Wickr business products.</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Wickr Terms of Service, so please read both documents carefully.\nYour use of the Services indicates your consent to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.\nIf you do not want to be bound by these agreements, you may not use our Services.</p>\n<p>We work very hard to preserve your privacy and security, and we do our best to be as transparent as possible in explaining how we use your data in providing our Services.\nNot only is Wickr\u2019s security architecture and proprietary encryption methodology designed to ensure that only users can gain access to their message content, we promise to never monetize your communications or personal information.\nEver.\nPlease contact us if you have any questions at&nbsp;privacy@wickr.com</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Privacy Practices in Brief:</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Wickr has to collect some information from you in order to provide our Services to you, but we work to do so in a limited and secure way, as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can\u2019t see the messages you transmit using the Service, the rooms you create or your contacts.\nBecause of this we don\u2019t know \u2014 and can\u2019t reveal to others \u2014 anything about you or how you use the Wickr Me App aside from the limited information such as the date your account was created, the date of last use and the type of device on which such account was installed.\nPlease see our&nbsp;Legal Process Guidelines&nbsp;for more details.</li>\n<li>We do not track, log or store users\u2019 unique device information, IP or geo-location data or similar metadata associated with your use of the Wickr Me App.</li>\n<li>When you send or receive files using Wickr Me, it is important to note that if you do not trust the person you\u2019re talking to, do not open files coming from them or send them photos/files you do not want to be saved.</li>\n<li>You control how long your messages are viewable on recipient devices.\nHowever, there is no magic pill for betrayal and we cannot prevent someone using a camera to take a picture of a message on a screen.\nTherefore, we strongly encourage you to only send private messages or sensitive information to people you know and trust.</li>\n<li>When you block someone from being able to contact you on Wickr Me, they are automatically added to the block list in your settings.\nTo protect your privacy, they won\u2019t know that you are blocking them when they send you a message.</li>\n<li>If you enabled message notifications for Wickr Me, you will receive notifications about incoming messages on your device\u2019s home screen which will contain the sender\u2019s name as you set it in your Wickr contacts.\nYou can also enable message preview in Wickr settings for notifications, which will add the content of a message to the home screen notifications.\nPlease note, if you don\u2019t want other to see who is messaging you on Wickr Me, you can disable notifications in your device settings in which case you will continue to receive messages, but notifications will not appear on your home screen.</li>\n<li>You own your data.\nWe do not share or sell any data about our users.\nPeriod.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>What Information Does Wickr Collect and How Is It Used?</strong>\n<br>We are committed to limiting our collection of your information to what is necessary to provide you with our Services in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.</p>\n<p>The limited information we collect, receive, or have access to is used to provide the Service, to allow you to send and receive messages and files, to respond to your requests, and to improve the Service, in line with the legitimate interest we have in delivering the Services to you.\nIt may also be shared under valid legal process and with third party service providers for the limited purposes described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What We Don\u2019t Collect</strong>\n<br>Equally important to us is to share what information we don\u2019t collect.\nWe do not collect your location information or have access to the contents of the communications you send using the Wickr Me App.\nRemember, however, that if you send a Wickr message to another Wickr user, that message or related content might remain on their device even after you delete it from yours, depending on the value you set for the expiration or burn-on-read time of that message and whether the recipient took a screenshot of the message.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User-Provided Information</strong>\n<br>We collect some very limited information from you after you download the Wickr Me App in order to allow you to create a Wickr Me Account, and begin using the Wickr Me App.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Your Wickr ID:</strong>&nbsp;Your Wickr ID is how you allow others to contact you via Wickr Me.\nIt does not have to be your real name or provide any reference to your identity.\nLike other information pertaining to your account, it is disguised with multiple rounds of salted, cryptographic hashing when we associate it with your Device Information (described below).\nThe purpose of using this hashed representation is to allow you to use our Services without our needing to know who you are.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your Password:</strong>&nbsp;We require you to have a password to use the Wickr Me App, but we never store your password on our servers and don\u2019t store it by default in any form on your device.\nFor your own security, we recommend that you use a long, unique password consisting of a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Optional User-Provided Information</strong>\n<br>Within the Wickr Me App, we provide a few optional features for your convenience.\nSome of these features, described below, will ask for personal information.\nIf you want to keep your use of Wickr Me as anonymous as possible, please read these sections carefully in order to understand how we associate information you provide with your Wickr Me account.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Push Notifications:</strong>&nbsp;When setting up your Wickr Me account, we will ask if you want to receive notifications of new Wickr messages, software updates, and other administrative and technological developments.\nPush notifications are functions of device\u2019s operating system, so if you enable this feature, your devices operating system\u2019s manufacturer will know that you are using the Wickr Me App, but will not know anything about how you use it or be able to see anything you transmit through it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Phone Number:</strong>&nbsp;If you add your phone number to your account to facilitate contact searching, we use a third party service to deliver a confirmation SMS to you, but that service will not receive any information about you other than your phone number, and the SMS message itself will contain no information except a confirmation link.\nWe then store a hashed representation of your phone number on our servers in lieu of the actual phone number to facilitate searching.\nOur contact search feature operates entirely on hashed representations of phone numbers and rate limited search functions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Invitations:</strong>&nbsp;If you wish to invite others to use the Wickr Me App, you will be asked for permission to access your device\u2019s contacts in order to invite them to use our Services.\nWe never store your device contacts on our servers in any way.\nAll invitations are generated locally on your device, without sharing any information with us.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contacts:</strong> If you allow the Service to access your device\u2019s contacts to see who among them is on Wickr Me, the Service will send hashed representations of your contacts\u2019 phone numbers to our servers to ensure that our server never accesses your actual contact list.&nbsp;We never store your device contacts in any form on our servers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Avatar: If you set a public profile avatar, </strong>it will become visible to others on Wickr, so please do not add an avatar if you do not intend it to be viewed by other users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatically Collected Information</strong>\n<br>Wickr collects two types of information automatically during your setup and use of the Wickr Me App: Device Information, Aggregate Usage Data, and Crash Logs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Device Information:</strong>&nbsp;The Wickr App may collect hashed representations of your mobile device\u2019s hardware ID and/or other platform-related information during registration.\nThis information is used to tie your account to your device.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Aggregate Usage Data:</strong>&nbsp;During the operation of our services, we also collect aggregate, anonymous information about basic usage statistics, such as the number of messages sent by Wickr Me users daily, what types of messages our users tend to send (e.g., voice messages more often than text), and other key performance indicators.\nWe never attempt to, and cannot, identify users associated with any of this information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Crash Logs:</strong>&nbsp;For the purpose of debugging, error correction, and system continuity, Wickr Apps transmit crash logs to a cloud-based bug reporting platform.\nThe logs do not contain any user personal information and they pertain only to the Wickr Me App.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>What Information Does Wickr Share with Third Parties?</strong>\n<br>We do not share any user information we have with third parties, with the exception of the third-party service with whom we share your phone number for the sole purpose of sending you an SMS confirmation if you choose to associate your phone number with your Wickr Me ID.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Law Enforcement:</strong>\n<br>Please see our full&nbsp;Legal Process Guidelines, but here are the highlights:</p>\n<p>We will always notify our users of any third-party requests for their information unless we are legally prohibited from doing so.\nAs soon as legally permissible, we will notify our users of requests for their information.\nWe require a warrant before handing over the contents of communications.\nhowever, because of the nature of our technology, the contents of communications will be encrypted and undecipherable if obtained.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You Can Terminate Your Account</strong>\n<br>You can terminate your account at any time.\nOnce terminated, your account will be irrevocably suspended, ensuring that nobody can use that Wickr ID again in order to prevent impersonation.\nIf you wish to terminate your Wickr Me account, go to Settings, \u201cTerminate Account\u201d and verify by entering your password.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We Retain As Little Data As Possible, for the Least Time Possible</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention on Wickr\u02bcs Servers:&nbsp;</strong>Our servers store the encrypted messages that you send and receive for up to 6 days to ensure their reliable delivery to each device associated with your account and the accounts to which you transmit messages.\nWe retain certain account data (i.e., types of messages sent and account settings changes) which contain no PII for up to 6 days.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention on Your Device:</strong>&nbsp;All messages are stored in encrypted form on end users\u2019 devices.\nYou choose your own retention policy for your messages by choosing how long a message is viewable before it is deleted (via the expiration or burn-on-read time for sent messages, recall ability and manual deletion for your device).\nIn addition, Wickr\u2019s \u201csecure shredder\u201d technology uses forensic deletion techniques to help reduce the risk of deleted messages and temporary data being recovered.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We Are Serious About Security</strong>\n<br>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information.\nWe provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain.\nFor example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Services.\nNo sensitive information is in the clear: we take reasonable efforts (as described herein) to ensure that everything we store is not retrievable by us or anyone else.</p>\n<p>However, as security experts, we know that no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.\nTherefore, we have limited the potential implications of such a breach by designing our system so that in the event of a breach, we would have the least possible information about you.</p>\n<p>Wickr\u2019s network infrastructure and services are maintained in highly secure, strategically located data centers managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nLearn more about AWS security policies&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<br>Wickr is not directed to children under the age of 13.\nIf we learn that we have allowed a child under 13 to access our Services, we will take appropriate steps to promptly remove such account and delete all information associated with such account.</p>\n<p>If you live in any other country except those in the&nbsp;European Region, you must be at least 13 years old to register for the Services.\nIf you live in the&nbsp;European Region, you must be at least 16 years old to register for and use our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer Service</strong>\n<br>In an ongoing effort to improve our services and assist our customers with any questions they have about the use of the Wickr Me App, we have developed a comprehensive collection of the most commonly asked customer support questions and answers, which are available&nbsp;here.\nAny information provided to us by our users voluntarily when they request customer support (e.g., an email address, Wickr Me App version, or any other details related to user issue) will be used to respond to that individual request and may be logged as part of our effort to improve our customer service and solve any product-related issues.\nThis user-provided information cannot be linked to our users Wickr Me accounts, unless users voluntarily include their Wickr Me account information in their customer service-related requests.\nWe strongly discourage our users from disclosing their passwords to Wickr Me accounts to third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie Policy</strong>\n<br>We tirelessly work on improving our services and raising awareness about our products, which are designed to ensure our users\u2019 security and privacy.\nTo accomplish these goals, we use cookies on the Wickr website that enable us to learn how visitors navigate our content and interact with our marketing materials so we can be more effective at informing our users about product developments.</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small text file that is placed in visitors\u2019 browsers to help us learn when users arrive at our site, how they use the site, when they leave, and when they come back.&nbsp;These cookies can never be used to identify user accounts within the Wickr App.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of how we may use information collected via cookies: we may think that one of our new features would be very useful to the Wickr community, but cookies may tell us that very few users fully read that feature\u2019s description on our site.\nThat insight would help us to rethink the way we explain that product on our site or present it in an advertisement so that we can better communicate our services to our users.</p>\n<p>We make every reasonable effort to minimize the information we collect.\nFor example, we enforce IP masking for the website analytics purposes to conceal the last 4 digits of IP addresses which ensures that visitor\u2019s full IP addresses are not collected via third party services such as Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>We provide the utmost transparency on and an up-to-date overview of cookies used on our website including the ability for website visitors to&nbsp;check, withdraw or modify&nbsp;consent for non-necessary cookies at any time.&nbsp;More information on our Cookie Policy can be found&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Web Forms</strong>\n<br>To enable our visitors to reach out to us with sales inquiries, we may collect information using online form submissions.\nPlease note that all information you provide via web forms on our site is strictly voluntary and will never be used in any way that is inconsistent with other provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties</strong>\n<br>To improve Wickr\u2019s products, website, or marketing, we may engage with various outside partners that have access to the limited data users voluntarily share with Wickr via the app, web forms, cookies, or customer support and sales inquiries.\nWe carefully select each of our partners based on Wickr\u2019s commitment to user privacy and security.\nOur security team meticulously vets each prospective partner to ensure its policies and practices are on par with Wickr\u2019s standards.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To assist Wickr with improving our web content and advertising activities, we partner with&nbsp;Pardot, a B2B Marketing Automation Platform, and&nbsp;Salesforce.</li>\n<li>To accelerate resolution of the most frequent customer inquiries, Wickr\u2019s support is automated in collaboration with&nbsp;Zendesk, a customer support platform.</li>\n<li>To deliver a confirmation SMS to our users opting in to connect with friends via ID Connect, we use&nbsp;Twilio.</li>\n<li>To host our website, we use&nbsp;WP Engine.</li>\n<li>To maintain high-security, fast and reliable service delivery worldwide, Wickr partners with&nbsp;AWS, a global infrastructure provider.</li>\n<li>To manage bug reports, we use&nbsp;Bugsnag and Backtrace, which are cloud-based bug reporting platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these companies has its own policies for handling user data.\nPlease review the respective privacy policies for&nbsp;Zendesk,&nbsp;Twilio,&nbsp;Pardot,&nbsp;WP Engine,&nbsp;AWS,&nbsp;Bugsnag, and Backtrace for a more complete understanding of their practices.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions regarding our privacy protection practices, please email us at&nbsp;privacy@wickr.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We Can Change This Privacy Policy</strong>\n<br>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time, for any reason.\nWe will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here along with information about what has changed and an archive of past policies.\nYou are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.\nBy continuing to use the Services, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Users Outside the US</strong>\n<br>If you use our Services, your information will be transferred to the U.S.\nand will be processed and stored under U.S.\ndata protection and privacy regulations which may differ from those your country of residence.\nBy using our Services and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to and processing in the U.S.\nWe take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this policy.\nPlease note that all user communications on the Wickr Service are protected between devices and are never stored unencrypted hence are undecipherable to Wickr or other third parties.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for complying with any laws or regulations in your country that govern use of applications and services like Wickr Me.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact Us if You Have
