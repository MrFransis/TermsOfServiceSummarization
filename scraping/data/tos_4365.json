right more than once per year.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.7.2</strong> To the extent the Standard Contractual Clauses apply and the Customer reasonably argues and establishes that the above documentation

22, 2020<br>Prior TOS available here.</p> Introduction<p>\n<strong>Welcome to DigitalOcean\u2019s Terms of Service!</strong> The first portion of our Terms of Service is an introduction, which is structured like an FAQ and lays out some high-level concepts before diving into other terms.</p>What documents make up the TOS?<p>We refer to the Terms of Service as the <strong>\u201cTOS\u201d</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This page lays out the core of our TOS, but we also have other contractual documents that you can think of as additional terms for specific topics.\nLegally speaking, these other documents are incorporated by reference as if they were written here and form part of the overall TOS.\nTherefore, you should also review these other documents, which can be found at the links below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data Processing Agreement, which outlines the terms of data processing on your behalf through our Services</li>\n<li>Acceptable Use Policy (the \u201c<strong>AUP</strong>\u201d), which outlines prohibited uses of our Services</li>\n<li>Privacy Policy, which outlines how we collect, use, and share data in our Websites and Services</li>\n<li>Marketplace Terms of Service, which outlines the terms for vendors in the DigitalOcean Marketplace</li>\n</ul>Whom does this TOS apply to?<p>When we refer to <strong>\u201cDigitalOcean\u201d</strong> or we use pronouns like <strong>\u201cwe\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong> or <strong>\u201cour\u201d</strong>, we are referring to DigitalOcean, LLC as well as its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>When we refer to the <strong>\u201cUser\u201d</strong>, we are talking about <em>you</em>, and we will also use words like <strong>\u201cyou\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cyour\u201d</strong> to refer to you.\nWho \u201cyou\u201d are can get more complicated if you are using our services on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity.\nIn that case, you are representing to us that you have the authority to bind your company, organization, other entity to this TOS and that you agree to be legally bound by this TOS on behalf of such entity (and \u201c<strong>User</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201d, and \u201c<strong>your</strong>\u201d then refer to such entity).\nIf you aren\u2019t sure what this means or whether you are authorized to bind your company, organization, or entity to this contract, you should ask others in your organization to get clarification about authority.</p>What is the TOS?<p>This TOS is a binding contract between you and DigitalOcean, and covers all of the offerings, websites, products, services, features, content, applications and other things we offer to users like you.</p>\n<p>We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the <strong>\u201cWebsites\u201d</strong>) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the <strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>).</p>\n<p>As you will see later in the TOS, Section 3 (Website Terms) is specific to your use of the Websites and Section 4 (Service Terms) is specific to your use of the Services.</p>When does this TOS apply to me?<p>Now that we have some common language, we want to ensure you understand when and how the TOS applies.\n</p>\n<p>First and foremost, you must understand that this is a binding legal contract that is required to use our Websites and Services.\nAs such, you may only use our Websites and Services if you agree that you that have read, understood, and consented to be bound by this TOS.\n</p>\n<p>If you sign up for Services or create an account through our Websites, this TOS takes effect when you click \u201cI accept\u201d or other functionality indicating your acceptance of its terms.\nIf you purchase Services through a separate written contract, this TOS is incorporated into that contract, whether it is called out or not.\nRegardless of these other methods, when you access or use our Websites and Services, this TOS applies and is legally binding on you and to your access and use.\nThese are common examples, and this paragraph does not necessarily include all the other ways you can become bound to this TOS.</p>What happens with disputes under this TOS?<p>One requirement of our TOS is that you must agree to resolve disputes arising under this TOS through binding arbitration directly between you and DigitalOcean.\nIn arbitration, a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators will hear the arguments of both sides and decide on disputes in an expedient and cost-effective manner.\nYou will still be able to pursue cases in court when those cases are for small claims, but all other claims will be subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p>You should understand that this means neither you nor DigitalOcean will have the opportunity to resolve some disputes in court before a judge or jury.\nYou will be unable to pursue claims in a conventional trial and will not be able to participate in a court-based class action or similar proceeding.</p>Terms &amp.\nConditions of the TOS1.\nEligibility

use of, or your inability to access or use, the Websites and Services or any materials or content on the Websites and Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), statute, or any other legal theory, and whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of damage.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, you agree we will have no liability for any data that may be destroyed, lost or otherwise rendered inaccessible, whether because you failed to backup your data or for any other reason.</p>\n<p>10.2 Except as provided in Section 13 and to the fullest

amount you have paid to us for the Services at issue in the month prior to the event or circumstance giving rise to claim.</p>\n<p>10.3 Each provision of this TOS that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is intended to and does allocate the risks between the parties under this TOS.\nThis allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between you and us.\nEach of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of this TOS.\nThe limitations in this section will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>11.\nIndemnification<p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, you are responsible for your use of the Websites and Services, and you shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our employees, officers, directors, agents, contractors, and representatives from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, that arise from or relate to your Services Content, User Content, your End Users, or your access to or use of the Websites and Services, including your breach of this TOS or applicable law, willful misconduct, negligence, illegal activity, breach of security or data, unauthorized access to or use of your Account, or infringement of a third party\u2019s right, including any intellectual property, confidentiality, property or privacy right.\nWe reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter, in which event you will make best efforts to assist and cooperate with us in defending the matter at your expense.</p>12.\nTermination<p>While we prefer to give advance notice of termination, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or any part of the Websites and/or Services at any time, with or without notice, effective immediately.\nAny such termination may result in the immediate forfeiture and destruction of data associated with your Account.\nExcept as otherwise set forth herein or expressly agreed between the parties, any and all fees paid to us are non-refundable and any and all fees still owed to us at the time of such termination shall be immediately due and payable.\nUpon termination, any and all rights granted to you by this TOS will immediately be terminated, and you must also promptly discontinue all use of the Websites and/or Services.\nAll provisions of this TOS which by their nature should reasonably be expected to survive termination shall survive termination, including Sections 2.1-2.4, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.</p>13.\nDispute Resolution and Arbitration<p>13.1 In the interest of resolving disputes between you and DigitalOcean in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, and except as described in Section 13.2, you and DigitalOcean agree that every dispute arising in connection with this TOS will be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nThis agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this TOS, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this TOS, if applicable.\nYou understand and agree that, by entering into this TOS, you and DigitalOcean are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>\n<p>13.2 Despite the other provisions of Section 13, nothing in this TOS will waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>\n<p>13.3 Any arbitration between you and DigitalOcean will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201d) as modified by this TOS.\nThe AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>\n<p>13.4 A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (\u201c<strong>Notice of Arbitration</strong>\u201d).\nDigitalOcean\u2019s address for notice is: DigitalOcean, LLC, ATTN: Legal, 101 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10013 USA.\nThe Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201c<strong>Demand</strong>\u201d).\nThe parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or DigitalOcean may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nAll arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or DigitalOcean must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</p>\n<p>13.5 Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Manhattan, New York, NY, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn that case, you agree to reimburse DigitalOcean for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>13.6 You and DigitalOcean agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.\nFurther, unless both you and DigitalOcean agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>13.7 If any portion of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable, then that portion will be null and void and the remainder of this Section 13 will reasonably remain in effect.\nIn such event, if Section 13 cannot reasonably remain in effect as a whole, you and DigitalOcean agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14.4 will govern any action arising out of or related to this TOS.</p>14.\nMiscellaneous Provisions<p>14.1 Updates and Modifications.\nDigitalOcean reserves the right to update, change or otherwise modify this TOS on a going-forward basis at any time and in DigitalOcean\u2019s sole discretion.\nIf DigitalOcean updates this TOS, DigitalOcean may provide notice of such updates, such as by sending an email notification to the email address listed in your Account and/or updating the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the beginning of this TOS.\nUpdates will be effective on the date specified in the notice.\nBy continuing to access or use the Websites or Services after the date specified in the notice or updated TOS, you are agreeing to accept and be bound by the updated TOS and all of the terms incorporated therein.\nIf you do not agree to the updated TOS, then you may not continue to use the Websites or Services and your sole and exclusive remedy is to deactivate your Account and otherwise discontinue use of the Websites and/or Services.</p>\n<p>14.2 General.\nThis TOS, including all documents expressly incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations, written or oral, concerning its subject matter.\nUse of section headers in this TOS is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision.\nAny use of the singular shall be reasonably construed as if it also includes the plural, and vice versa.\nIf not already specified, any use of \u201cincluding\u201d or \u201csuch as\u201d shall be construed to mean \u201cincluding but not limited to.\u201d If any part of this TOS is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\nThe failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of this TOS, or any provision of this TOS, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>\n<p>14.3 Assignment.\nYou may not assign, transfer or delegate this TOS or any of your rights and obligations under the TOS, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.\nWe may assign, transfer or delegate this TOS or our rights and obligations under this TOS without notice or consent.\nSubject to this section, this TOS will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and any assignment or transfer in violation of this section will be void.</p>\n<p>14.4 Governing Law.\nThis TOS and any dispute related thereto (including under Section 13) is governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflict of law principles.\nSubject to Section 13, you and DigitalOcean submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within New York County, New York for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under this TOS.</p>\n<p>14.5 Notice.\nYou must send notices by certified U.S.\nMail or by Federal Express (signature required and return receipt requested) to: DigitalOcean, LLC, 101 Avenue of the Americas, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10013 USA.\nYou agree to receive electronic notices from us, which will be sent by email to the email address then associated with your Account.\nNotices are effective on the date on the return receipt or, for email, when sent.\nYou are responsible for ensuring that the email address associated with your Account is accurate and current.\nAny email notice that we send to that email address will be effective when sent, whether or not you actually receive the email.</p>\n<p>14.6 Consent to Electronic Communications.\nBy using the Websites and/or Services, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy.\nPlease read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices.\nYou agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>\n<p>14.7 Notice to California Residents.\nIf you are a California resident, under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, you may contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 N.\nMarket Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 in order to resolve a complaint or to receive further information regarding use of the Websites or Services.</p>\n<p>14.8 Relationship of the Parties.\nThe parties are independent contractors.\nThis TOS does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties.\nNeither party, nor any of their respective affiliates, is an agent of the other for any purpose or has the authority to bind the other.</p>\n<p>14.9 Force Majeure.\nDigitalOcean shall not be liable for nonperformance of the terms herein to the extent that DigitalOcean is prevented from performing as a result of any act or event which occurs and is beyond DigitalOcean's reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, unrest or riot, strikes, any action of a governmental entity, weather, quarantine, fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, utility or telecommunications outages, Internet disturbance, epidemic, pandemic or any unforeseen change in circumstances, or any other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>\n<p>14.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries.\nThis TOS does not create any third party beneficiary rights in any individual or entity that is not a party to this TOS.</p>\n<p>14.11 Government Use.\nDigitalOcean provides the Websites and Services, including related software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with the following: Government technical data and software rights related to the Websites and Services include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this TOS.\nThis customary commercial license is provided in accordance with FAR

Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation).\nIf a government agency has a need for rights not conveyed under this TOS, then it must negotiate with DigitalOcean to determine if there are
