Waiver</b>\n<br>\n<br> You and we agree that all disputes and claims between you and us shall be settled by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and includes, but is not limited to, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services, our software, our website, the Terms or any aspect of the relationship between you and us.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to the Agreement, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nThis arbitration provision does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms and the termination of your account.\n<br>\n<br> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to us should be addressed to: IPVanish, ATTN: Legal Department, 700 S.\nFlower St., Suite 1500, Los Angeles, CA 90017, USA (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nIf you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by us or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled.\nYou may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.jams.com.\nIf you are required to pay a filing fee, after we receive notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000.\n<br>\n<br> The arbitration will be governed by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures and the JAMS Expedited Arbitration Procedures (collectively, \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) of JAMS, as modified by the Terms, and will be administered by JAMS.\nJAMS Rules and Forms are available online at www.jamsadr.com.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the Terms.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.\nUnless you and we agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place by video or telephone conference.\nIf your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by JAMS Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by JAMS Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nThe arbitrator is not authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party\u2019s actual damages, and may not, in any event, make any ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.<br>\n<br> We may make a written settlement offer anytime before an arbitrator is selected.\nIf the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then we will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater.\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by JAMS Rules.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>General Terms</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<blockquote>\n<strong>23.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire
