identifiable individual.\nIn the following sections, we will outline the details of what we collect and how:</p>\nInformation You Provide\n<p>When you sign up, we create an account for you on our servers (\u201cAccount\u201d) to access our Services.\nWe will store information such as your first name, last name, job title, department and email address.</p>\n<p>Fellow\u2019s primary objective is to help you manage your work relationships through the logging of discussions, feedback, goals/priorities and more with others that you work with (whether individually or in groups).\nFellow also offers smart suggestions on what actions you may want to take in order to optimize these relationships (for example, \u201cyou should ask for feedback from someone in particular\u201d).\nIn order to provide such suggestions, we need to compute a \u201cwork-graph\u201d that will give us insights into the people that you work with and how often you work with them.\nIn order to offer these Services, we require access to the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slack (applicable if you or your organization have installed our Slack bot): Information about the users in your Slack account and the individuals you interact with most often.\nIn particular, if Slack is connected: Slack Avatars, Slack Team Names, Slack Channel Membership, Communications within the @Fellow bot and metadata derived from such communications and OAuth&nbsp.\nTokens.\nWe do NOT request access to the content of your direct messages (\u201cDMs\u201d) or the content of your private channels.</li>\n<li>Microsoft Teams (applicable if you or your organization have installed our MS Teams bot): Information about the users in your Teams account and the individuals you interact with most often.\nIn particular, if Microsoft Teams is connected: Avatars, Team Names, Team Memberships, Communications within the @Fellow bot and metadata derived from such communications and OAuth Tokens.\nWe do NOT request access to the content of your chat messages (\u201cDMs\u201d) or the content of your private channels.</li>\n<li>Calendar (applicable if you connect your calendar): We access data about the events that you participate in such as organizer, title, attendees and optional attendees (names and emails), date, time, duration, calendar resources (meeting rooms) and recurrence of events.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you sign up, we may ask you more information including your job title, department, who your manager is and whether you have a 1on1 with this manager and which calendar event this corresponds to.\nWe also provide the opportunity for you to invite other individuals into the platform so that you may collaborate with them (in order to invite others, we may ask you for some further information about those Users including their name, email address and reporting relationship with you).</p>\n<p>The main interactions with Fellow will be both through our Bots and on our Platform.\nUsers on the system will be able to collaborate on notes in relation to 1:1 and group meetings, goals/priorities and request feedback from one another and provide feedback to each other.\nThe content created by these Users will be stored and accessible through the Services.\nThis information is by default only accessible to Users who were part of the interactions and is not accessible by managers of the company (unless those that were part of the feedback interactions explicitly share such feedback with others such as managers).\nMetadata about the interactions (such as stats on usage) will be available to managers.\nThe only exception to this rule will be if the policies of the Organization require us to share this information upon request from the Organization.</p>\nInformation Collected through Systems\nServers\n<p>Our servers (hosted by Amazon Web Services) collect information including the type of browser and O/S you use, your IP Address, domain name and the timing / duration of your visit

that display advertising about our services on other unaffiliated websites.\nWe use third party social media platforms (e.g.\nFacebook, Linkedin, etc.) to show you customized social media ads and interest-based ads.</p>\nInformation Collected from Others\n<p>By connecting to Slack and Calendar as mentioned earlier in this document, we will be able to determine who works with whom with your organization so as to offer you smart suggestions on how to improve your working relationships with people in your network.</p>\n<p>Our MS Teams bot is enabled by the Microsoft Bot Framework.\nThe
