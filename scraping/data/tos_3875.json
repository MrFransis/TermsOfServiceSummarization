are\n<p>Our website address is: https://karlrock.com.</p>\nWhat personal data we collect and why we collect it\nComments\n<p>When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor\u2019s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.</p>\n<p>An anonymised string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it.\nThe Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/.\nAfter approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.</p>\nContact forms\nCookies\n<p>If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in cookies.\nThese are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment.\nThese cookies will last for one year.</p>\n<p>If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies.\nThis cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser.</p>\n<p>When
