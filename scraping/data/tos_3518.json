Introduction\n<p>Welcome to MediaMath\u2019s Privacy Policy (\u201c<strong>Policy</strong>\u201d).\nIn this Policy, we use the terms \u201c<strong>MediaMath</strong>\u201c, \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201c, \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d to refer to MediaMath, Inc.\nand our affiliates.</p>\n<p>MediaMath is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals (\u201c<strong>users</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201c, \u201c<strong>your</strong>\u201c) when we process data about them via our proprietary TerminalOne\u2122 platform (the \u201c<strong>Platform</strong>\u201c), when they visit our website at www.mediamath.com (the \u201c<strong>Website</strong>\u201c) and when we engage in marketing activities based on contact information they provide to MediaMath through other means described in this Policy.</p>\n<p>This Policy is provided in a layered format, so you can click through to the specific sections that may interest you.</p> 1.\nImportant information and who we are\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Purposes of this Policy</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This Policy sets out how MediaMath collects and processes personal data, personal information or the equivalent terminology in your jurisdiction (\u201c<strong>personal data</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>personal information</strong>\u201c) about you via the Platform, when you visit the Website, and when we engage in marketing activities based on contact information you provide to MediaMath through other means described in this Policy.\nIt also sets out our practices regarding our use of such personal data, the steps we take to protect it, the parties to whom we disclose it, and the choices and rights that you have regarding how we collect and process personal data about you.</p>\n<p>You should read this Policy carefully so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Who we are</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>MediaMath is a global provider of digital advertising media and data management technology.\nWe provide a technology platform and services which help advertisers do a more effective job of reaching their desired audiences.\nThis technology delivers greater performance, transparency, and control to advertisers and a better Internet experience to users.\nOur Demand-Side Platform enables our clients, including advertisers and advertising agencies, to purchase advertising inventory, including display, video, audio, social, native, digital out-of-home (e.g., billboards or ads you may see in taxis or buses) and mobile ads, from publishers in an automated fashion.\nOur Data Management Platform provides our clients with tools to onboard, segment, activate, and understand their data.</p>\n<p>When MediaMath processes your personal data as a controller in the context of operating the Platform, the Website and our marketing activities, the controller of your personal data is MediaMath, Inc.\nIf our clients have contracted with MediaMath GmbH, both MediaMath, Inc.\nand MediaMath GmBH are controllers of your personal data.</p>\n<p>MediaMath is an active member of the industry associations that govern policies around user privacy in the context of digital advertising, including at the time this Policy was written: the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d).\nthe Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d), the DAA Canada, and the European Interactive DAA.\nthe Interactive Advertising Bureau in the US, Europe and various countries around the world.\nand the Association of National Advertisers.\nMediaMath complies with the \u201cNAI Code of Conduct\u201d, the DAA \u201cSelf-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising\u201d, and their \u201cApplication of Self-Regulatory Principles to the Mobile Environment\u201d.\nWe believe that these programs\u2019 principles help protect user privacy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> &nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Changes to the Policy</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time, MediaMath may revise this Policy.\nThe date of the last update can be found at the top of the Policy, and this policy describes how we have handled personal data in the twelve months prior to the date indicated.\nIf we make revisions that materially change or affect whether or how we collect or use personal data, we will notify you by email (if, as a user of our Website or recipient of our marketing communications, you have provided us your email address) or by means of a notice on our Website prior to the change becoming effective.\nIf you would like to stay up-to-date on our most current policies and practices, you should periodically review this Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Personal data pertaining to children</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>MediaMath\u2019s products and services are not designed to deliver personalized ads to children, the definition of which varies by jurisdiction, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from or about children.\nIf we are made aware that we have received personal data from or about a child, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that data from our records.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Links, other websites and other third parties</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>This Policy relates solely to the personal data we collect and process about you in relation to our Platform, our Website, and other interactions you may have with MediaMath that are described in this Policy.\nMediaMath\u2019s Website contains links to other sites, and the ads delivered by the Platform may run on a variety of other sites.\nClicking on those links, accessing other sites, or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.\nMediaMath does not control these third-party sites and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites.\nYou should refer to the privacy statements of such third-party sites to find out how they collect and use your personal data.\nAlso, as explained below in Section 5, third parties may process personal data from you when you visit the Website.\nSuch processing is governed by the privacy statements of such third parties.</p> 2.\nThe personal data collected via the Platform\n<p>While MediaMath collects certain categories of personal data in the course of delivering an ad to you via the Platform, we do not intentionally collect directly identifiable data such as your name, home address, phone number, or any government identifiers such as your Social Security Number unless you provide such data in connection with any request that you may choose to make directly to MediaMath.\nInstead, MediaMath collects certain personal data related to your computer or device through the use of cookies and other similar technologies, as explained below.</p>\n<p>We may assign a unique identifier called a MediaMath ID to your browser, your devices, such as your mobile device, connected television, or over-the-top television devices (\u201c<strong>OTT TV Device</strong>\u201c), or other screens you may encounter when we serve an ad to it or when you use it to access a client\u2019s digital properties.\nDigital Properties include websites, emails, apps (\u201c<strong>Digital Properties</strong>\u201c).\nThe MediaMath ID enables the Platform to determine within a reasonable level of confidence that a browser or devices is the same one with which the Platform has previously interacted.\nFor example, the MediaMath ID allows us to determine that a browser or device to which we served an ad on Monday is likely to be the same browser or device for which we observed a purchase on Tuesday.\nIn some cases, based on data we receive from our clients or partners, we are able to infer within a reasonable probability that a particular browser or device should be associated with the same MediaMath ID.\nWhere we are able to associate more than one browser or device with the same MediaMath ID, we may use this information to deliver targeted ads across multiple browsers or devices.\nThis is sometimes referred to as cross-device advertising.</p>\n<p>The MediaMath ID can be a cookie ID (a unique ID assigned randomly by MediaMath to an unrecognized browser), a mobile advertising ID (a unique ID assigned by the mobile operating system, e.g.\nApple ID for Advertising or Android Advertising ID), or an OTT TV Device Identifier for Advertising (a unique ID assigned by an OTT TV provider, e.g., Roku ID for Advertising)).</p>\n<p>Your MediaMath ID is personal data and is associated with other categories of personal data that we collect about you.\nThese categories include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Bid Request Data and Impression Data:</strong> MediaMath receives personal data about you when we have the opportunity to show you an ad on Digital Properties and collects additional data when we deliver an ad.\nWe refer to this data as Bid Request Data and Impression Data.\nThe sources of Bid Request and Impression Data are your browser or device and media supply sources, such as publishers (i.e.\norganizations who operate Digital Properties) and exchanges or supply-side platforms who display ads on publishers\u2019 Digital Properties.\nThis includes data that may be considered personal data in your jurisdiction such as your Internet Protocol (\u201c<strong>IP</strong>\u201d) address, imprecise location (e.g., country, region, postal or zip code), browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer).\noperating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows).\nbrowser language (e.g., English or Spanish).\nand Internet Service Provider (e.g., Comcast or Verizon).\nIt also may include IDs that our partners assign to your browser or device, including Google advertising identifiers associated with your browser or device and used by MediaMath as part of its syncing processes.\nSee Google\u2019s Privacy Policy to learn more about its use of the personal data which it receives from partner sites and your ability to control the information which Google collects on these sites.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pixel Data and Other Client Data:</strong> MediaMath clients may import personal data to the Platform regarding your interactions with them when you visit their Digital Properties.\nWe may similarly collect personal data when you visit our Website.\nThis includes data that may be considered personal data in your jurisdiction such as the time you visited the site, the page URL, your IP address, your browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer), the operating system (e.g., Mac OS or Windows), the type of device you used (e.g.\nlaptop or desktop), and data regarding your activities on the Digital Properties.\nFor example, if you are shopping online for a product, place a product in your online shopping cart, or make an online purchase, the client associated with the website or app may use the Platform to collect that personal data and later show you an ad on a different site or app related to that product.\nMediaMath clients also may use the Platform to collect hashed personal data that does not reveal your direct identity, such as hashed email addresses.\nThe process of hashing is commonly used in digital advertising to convert directly identifiable personal data to pseudonymous personal data.\nWe refer to everything described above as Pixel Data.\nClients also may import personal data that they have obtained outside of the Platform, such as segments that our clients create or obtain independently from third-party sources.\nA segment is a grouping of individuals who share one or more attributes (e.g., \u201ccar enthusiast\u201d).\nThese individuals are identified by an online identifier in these segments but are not identified by name or other personal data that directly reveals their identity.\nClients also may import personal data that they collect or independently obtain offline, such as personal data regarding a purchase you made in the client\u2019s store.\nThe client\u2019s offline data is first processed by the client or a third party, which removes any directly identifiable personal data, appends a MediaMath ID, and transmits the file to MediaMath for processing.\nWe refer to this data as Other Client Data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third-Party Segment Data and Other Third-Party Data:</strong> We work with audience providers who create and provide us with segments for us and our clients to use for advertising purposes.\nWe refer to this as Third-Party Segment Data.\nWe also receive personal data from third-party partners that allows them and/or us to associate the MediaMath ID with those partners\u2019 identifiers (through a process called \u201ccookie syncing\u201d) as well as personal data that associates your different devices with each other.\nCertain third parties may provide personal data to us regarding video content that you view on television.\nWe refer to this personal data in the Policy as Other Third-Party Data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Special or Sensitive Categories of Personal Data:</strong> We do not knowingly collect any special categories of personal data about individuals in the EEA, including: personal data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership.\npersonal data concerning your health, sex life, or sexual orientation.\nand genetic or biometric data.\nMediaMath also does not knowingly collect any data about other sensitive categories such as personal data about children, financial account numbers, insurance plan numbers, and criminal convictions or offenses.</li>\n</ul> 3.\nHow we collect personal data via the Platform\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Platform uses various technologies to collect your personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Personal data we collect from your browser or device</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Like most digital marketing platforms, MediaMath uses cookies and other technologies to recognize browsers and devices and collect the categories of personal data described above in Section 2 so that we and our clients can infer your interests, deliver more relevant advertising to you, measure the impact of that advertising, and better understand your digital media usage patterns.</p>\n<p>The types of technologies used via the Platform that enable us to identify a computer or device, and enable the Platform to function and serve more relevant ads include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookies</strong> \u2013 Cookies are small text files.\nMediaMath uses cookies to uniquely identify an Internet browser.\nCertain browsers or browser settings sometimes block cookies or prevent them from working effectively.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pixels</strong> \u2013 Pixels are transparent images, iFrames, JavaScript or mobile SDKs that we, our clients, and our partners use to understand how users interact with their Digital Properties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Personal data we collect from third parties</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>As described above, we receive personal data from third parties such as our clients and partners, including audience data partners, media supply sources, and exchanges or supply-side platforms.\nWe receive this personal data in a number of ways, including through server-to-server transfers, a process called \u201ccookie syncing\u201d and other client and partner calls to MediaMath originating from the browser.\nWe process all of this personal data in the Platform.</p> 4.\nHow the Platform uses personal data\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use the personal data in the Platform to deliver more relevant ads to you on behalf of our clients.\nWe also use the personal data to improve our Platform and the products and services that we provide to our clients and partners, as well as to create new products and services.\nBelow, we have set out a description of specific ways we use various combinations of your personal data in the Platform.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Personal

location.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Segments</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>As described above, a segment is a grouping of users who share one or more attributes.\nWhere allowed by applicable data protection law and industry self-regulatory associations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our clients may use health-related segments about non-sensitive conditions such as an inferred interest in health and wellness or cough medicine and allergy medications.\nClick here for a list of the standard health-related segments and a sample of custom health segments provided for use by clients in MediaMath\u2019s Platform.</li>\n<li>Our clients may use segments based on political information or interests.\nClick here for a list of the standard political interest segments and a sample of custom political segments provided for use by clients in MediaMath\u2019s Platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While MediaMath does not knowingly create segments that are based upon what we consider to be sensitive information (for example, we do not create segments of EEA users based on personal data considered to be sensitive in the EEA, such as personal data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, personal data concerning your health, sex life or sexual orientation, or genetic or biometric data), our clients may use the Platform to process some sensitive data (but excluding sensitive categories in the EEA), which may come from our clients\u2019 Digital Properties or our partners.\nMediaMath may process segments based on demographic information such as race, gender and income range where such is information is not considered sensitive.\nWe take steps designed to ensure that this is done in compliance with applicable laws and self-regulatory guidelines, including through our contracts and policies with our clients and partners, but our clients are responsible for this processing, and any queries should be directed to them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Automated decision-making and profiling</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Platform uses proprietary algorithms to make decisions about whether or not to bid on opportunities to serve you ads and, if so, how much to bid.\nThe ads you see are the result of client campaigns that specify how much to spend and on what basis to spend combined with the use of our algorithms.\nThe ways in which we use algorithms to determine bid prices may be considered automated decision-making in certain jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, these processes, in combination with client campaigns described below, may constitute profiling in certain jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>As explained above, we assign a MediaMath ID to your browser or device.\nUsing proprietary technology, we associate data that we collect about you with this MediaMath ID and create segments using inferred details about certain of your preferences, behaviors, and demographic information.\nMany of our clients\u2019 campaigns rely on such segments.\nFor example, if you are browsing a shoe retailer\u2019s website on your mobile device, we may infer that you are interested in buying sneakers and associate that mobile device with a sneaker-buyer segment.\nIf a client subsequently wants to advertise sneakers, the client may choose to target that segment across your devices.\nIf MediaMath then receives an opportunity to show you an ad on your computer browser, which has been associated with your mobile device by our algorithm, MediaMath\u2019s bidding technology will automatically decide whether to bid and if so what price to bid, based on the data and algorithms outlined above.</p>\n<p>The automated processes that we use do not affect your legal rights (such as your right to vote, take legal action, or freely associate with others) or your ability to receive social benefits or obtain citizenship, nor do they have legal effects on you.\nAlso, we do not knowingly process or make automated decisions about EEA users based on any data that falls into special categories in the EEA.\nAs described below, you have the right to object to this automated decision-making at any time and you may have additional rights described in Section 11.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Legal basis for processing </u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Our legal basis under the GDPR for collecting and using the personal data described above will depend on the personal data concerned and the specific context in which we process it.\nHowever, we will normally collect personal data from you only where the processing is in our (or a third party\u2019s, such as our clients\u2019) legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, such as your right to opt out.\nIf we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate the Platform and serve you ads on behalf of our clients.\nWe may have other legitimate interests and, if appropriate, we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Sale of personal information</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>For the purposes of the CCPA, MediaMath has sold all of the categories of personal information collected on the Platform for certain processing purposes in the past twelve months.\nIf you are a California resident and want to exercise your right to opt out of the sale of your personal information, please see the instructions below in the section Opt out of sale for California residents.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Opt-out and choice mechanisms</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<strong>Opt out of tailored advertising</strong>\n<p>If you want to limit the data that MediaMath collects about you and want us to not target ads that are based on your interests to your browsers or devices, you may opt out from MediaMath tracking and tailored advertising at any time through one of the ways described below.\n<strong>If you opt out, you will still see ads, but those ads are less likely to have anything to do with products or services you care about.</strong> With tailored advertising, you receive ads and offers that are more likely to be useful to you.</p>\n<p>Your opt-out is only applicable to the Platform and does not opt you out from platforms provided by third-party companies.\nHowever, you can opt out from both MediaMath and many third-party companies at once.\nto do so, please see \u201cOther ways to opt out of tailored advertising\u201d below.\nWhen you opt out, MediaMath will collect data from your browser, app, or device only as needed to honor your opt-out and for limited research and development purposes to improve our browser- and device-recognition technology, which also helps to improve our ability to honor your opt-out.\nWhen you opt out, MediaMath also stops targeting tailored advertising to the opted-out browser, app, or device.</p>\n<p>If you use multiple browsers or devices and wish to limit the data that MediaMath collects and do not wish to receive MediaMath tailored advertising on any of them, you must opt out from each browser and device individually.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Opt out of tailored advertising in a browser</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You may opt out if you are using a browser by clicking the \u201cClick
