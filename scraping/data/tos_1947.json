to your interests.\n<em>Mobile App</em>.\nYou may opt out of interest-based advertising on\nmobile devices by activating the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d or equivalent\nfeature offered by your mobile

provide you several ways to manage your preferences:</p>\nCookie Use and Controls\n<p>Cookies serve a wide variety of purposes.\nCookies are pieces of data\nstored in your web browser that are transmitted to websites to remember\nyour browser over time and distinguish it from other users.\nCookies are\nused to personalize your web experience and for security, analytics,\nmarketing, and

and use of data for cookie-based,\ninterest-based advertising.</p>\n<p>[&nbsp;IN&nbsp;] <strong>Required Cookies.</strong> These strictly necessary cookies are used\nfor core functionality, and recognize when you are signed in, are\nnecessary for security, and enforce your privacy preferences.\nWithout\nthese cookies, some functionality on our Website may fail.\nYou can block\nthese cookies

(IoT) device, or routing\ndevice.\nIP addresses, for purposes of this Privacy Policy, include\n\u201cpublic\u201d IP addresses, such as the IP address for a home router that is\nvisible to the

analytics partners may use\nIP addresses to group or correlate devices for purposes of analytics,\nsecurity and anti-fraud purposes, interest-based advertising, ad\ntargeting, ad attribution, and limiting ad frequency.</p>\n<p>You can choose not to have IP address used for purposes of advertising\nor analytics by using the cookie controls for \u201cAdvertising Cookies,\u201d and\n\u201cPerformance/Analytics,\u201d above.</p>\nWeb Pixels or Beacons Use\n<p>Pixels are extremely small image files that, when loaded by your web\nbrowser, cause the browser to make a network request to the party\ncorresponding to the pixel.\nIf that party\u2019s cookies are currently stored\nin your browser, those cookies will be transmitted with the request.\nBeacons can be used on web pages for advertising or to confirm the\nopening of a marketing email.\nWhen used in conjunction with cookies for\ninterest-based-advertising, the cookie controls above can be used to\ncontrol the purpose for which they are used.</p>\nHTML5 Local Storage\n<p>HTML5 Local Storage in the browser is different from cookies, but can be\nused for the same purpose (to pair a tracking ID to a particular web\nserver with your web browser so that the web server can identify your\nweb browser over time).\nYou can control the purpose for which HTML5\nLocal Storage is used by using the cookie controls outlined above.</p>\nSocial Network Interaction and Widgets\n<p>Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our Website passively\ntransmit data regarding a social network\u2019s members to that social\nnetwork, even when a button is not clicked.\nThese technologies may allow\na social network (e.g., Facebook) to personally identify its members and\nto know the web pages its members have visited.\nThis is true wherever\nsocial network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is\n\u201cclicked\u201d or \u201cpressed.\u201d If you belong to a social network or use these\ncategories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of\nthose services to understand the nature of the data that they collect\nand what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is\ncollected and used.\nIf you disable advertising cookies, the passive\ntracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.</p>\nMobile Device Advertising IDs,

resolved by binding\narbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the\nUnited States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and\nenforcement of this arbitration agreement (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d).\nIn\narbitration, Disputes are resolved by a neutral arbitrator instead of a\njudge or jury, discovery is more limited than in court, and the\narbitrator's decision is subject to limited review by courts.\nThe\narbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief\nas a court, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and\ndeclaratory relief.\nJudgment on the arbitrator's award may be entered in\nany court having jurisdiction thereof.\nSuch dispute resolution\nproceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a\nclass, consolidated or representative action.\nExcept where prohibited,\nyou and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of\nDisputes relating to your general use of the Services under the Consumer\nArbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\nPlease\nvisit&nbsp;www.adr.org&nbsp;for more information about\narbitration.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be\nconducted remotely as provided below.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted in English.\nA single independent and\nimpartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the\nAmerican Arbitration Association.\nThe arbitrator will decide all issues\nrelating to the enforceability, interpretation, scope, and application\nof this Arbitration Agreement (including \u201cgateway\u201d issues of\narbitrability, whether the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable or\nillusory and any defense to arbitration), and these Terms, except that a\ncourt may resolve any question regarding the validity or enforceability\nof the class action waiver set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe\nterm \"Dispute\" and the requirement to arbitrate will be broadly\ninterpreted.</p>\n<p>Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are\nintended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the\ncosts and burdens for everyone involved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be\nsolely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be\nchosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the\nparties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by\nthe parties.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered\nin any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or\nher decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed.\nThe arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in\nthe interests of justice.\nAll arbitration proceedings will be closed to\nthe public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be\npermanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of\nthe arbitration award.\nThe award of the arbitrator will be in writing\nand will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition\nof any claim.</p>\n<p>You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute\nwith us arising out of or relating to your choice to maintain an\naccount, access or use the Services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You are giving

forever barred.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be\ngoverned by the American Arbitration Association\u2019s rules.\nMyFitnessPal\nwill reimburse you for those fees up to $5,000, unless the arbitrator\ndetermines your claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, MyFitnessPal will not\nseek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator\ndetermines your claims are frivolous.</p>\n<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT,\nYOU MAY CHOOSE TO PURSUE YOUR CLAIM IN COURT AND NOT BY ARBITRATION

THAT\nCONTAINED AN ARBITRATION PROVISION.\nThe opt-out notice must be\npostmarked no later than the applicable deadline and emailed to:\nlegal@myfitnesspal.com.\nThe opt-out notice must state that you do not\nagree to this Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address,\nphone number and email address.\nThis procedure is the only way you can\nopt out of this Arbitration Agreement, and failure to comply strictly\nwith this procedure and the applicable deadline automatically will\nrender the opt-out notice null and void.\nIf you opt out of the\narbitration provision, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement\nwill continue to apply.</p>\n<p>If this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all\ndisputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the\njurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, New\nYork, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and\nvenue of these courts.\nYou and MyFitnessPal agree that

non-representative basis.\nand (3) neither you nor MyFitnessPal may be a class representative or\nclass member or otherwise participate in any class, representative,\nconsolidated, or private attorney general proceeding.</p>\n<p>This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFitnessPal from\nseeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without\nlimitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm\nan arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction.\nFurthermore,\nthis agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or MyFitnessPal from\n(i) applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or\nconservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state\nor federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible\nviolation of MyFitnessPal\u2019s intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you are a resident of the European
