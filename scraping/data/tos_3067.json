relating to this Agreement, the Content, or the Services (each, a \u201cDispute\u201d), such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nNEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nNOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT\u2019S JURISDICTION.\nDISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.\nAll disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.\nAll applicable JAMS\u2019 rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com.\nEach party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules.\nJudgment on the arbitrator\u2019s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nThis clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online.\nIf conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside.\nThe parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.\nThe parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.\nNothing in this Agreement will prevent AP from seeking injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to protect AP\u2019s proprietary interests.</p> 15.\nCLASS ACTION WAIVER <p>You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Dispute between us and you individually.\nTo the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other.\n(ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures.\nand (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.\nYOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</p> 16.\nEQUITABLE RELIEF <p>You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement.\nWe may, without waiving any other remedies under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced above.\nAll claims or disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be heard exclusively by any of the federal or state courts of competent jurisdiction located in the State of New York.</p> 17.\nDOWNLOADING THE APP <p>We make the App available through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.\nThe following terms apply to the

infringes that third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, AP will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement.</li>\n<li>Apple and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license to the App, and that, upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as related to your license of the App against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.</li>\n<li>You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S.\nGovernment embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.\nGovernment as a

applicable to you personally or to your location or other circumstances.</li>\n<li>You must also comply with all applicable third party terms of service when using the App.</li>\n</ul> 18.\nMISCELLANEOUS <p>Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Agreement.\nNo waiver shall be effective against us unless made in writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent instance.\nExcept as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter.\nThe section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any legal import.\nThis Agreement will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.\n</p>\n<p>Copyright 2021 The Associated Press</p>AP NEWS<ol>\n<li>Top Stories</li>\n<li>Video</li>\n<li>Contact Us</li>\n<li>Cookie Settings</li>\n</ol>Download AP
