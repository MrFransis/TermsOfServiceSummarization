</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nHow We Use the SDK Information </strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We use the SDK Information to provide a variety of Services to our Clients.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To Provide Our App and Website Services.\nWe use the SDK Information to offer and support app and website features provided through the SDKs, including those related to push notifications.\nThis includes, for instance, providing customer, technical and operational support for these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity.\nresolving disputes and enforcing our EULA and other rights we may have.\nIt also includes analyzing, customizing, and improving the features we offer Clients.</li>\n<li>To provide information and analytics to our Clients about the use of these app and website features provided through the SDKs, or to help app developers and website operators create or enhance user profiles.</li>\n<li>To enable clients to create inferences about End Users categorized into \u201cData Segments\u201d.\nFor instance, if SDK Information indicates that a particular device is frequently seen at restaurants, we might categorize a user for targeting of local restaurant offers.\nOr, if a user is frequently seen at sports stadiums, we might categorize the user as a \u201cSports Fan.\u201d</li>\n<li>To develop and use \u201cpredictive models\u201d \u2013 data models that try to predict End Users\u2019 potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis or across devices.</li>\n<li>To analyze ad performance, for instance, by attributing End Users\u2019 app installations, web visits, or store visits to ad campaigns.</li>\n<li>Sometimes, the SDK Information may be used to resolve identities across multiple devices, such as to match IP addresses or hashed emails to link an End User across (for instance) browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set top boxes, or other devices.</li>\n<li>Sometimes the SDK Information may be to perform any of the above functions, or other marketing or analytics services.\nOr, we may aggregate and create data \u201cmodels\u201d to do this \u2013 creating algorithms in order to predict certain trends and things that different End Users might have in common, for instance.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may deploy online cookies to track users across websites, or to associate users (and these cookies) with Mobile IDs.\nWe may do this to resolve user identifies across platforms, and to better or more accurately target messages to.\nYou can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in the Section titled \u201c<strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs </strong>.\u201d<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nHow and Why We Share the SDK Information.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>To Provide Services to Websites and Apps Using the SDKs</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We share the SDK Information with service providers, contractors and other companies to fulfill your orders, operate our business, communicate with you and make available our Services and this Website.\nThese service providers may help us perform any of the activities set forth in Section 2.\nFor instance, we may share certain of the information we collect or receive with companies that help us with billing and payment, marketing, advertising and email marketing, data enhancement (e.g., to provide more relevant offers), website hosting, technology and customer support, web and marketing analytics, anti-fraud or security operations, and other operational, marketing or business support.\n</li>\n<li>We likewise may share the SDK Information or Data Segments we create with website operators and app developers (for instance, related to push notifications they send) for their advertising, analytics, or other purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>OneSignal does not share SDK information with third parties except those who process the data on behalf of OneSignal.\nData is only shared with third parties if:</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If an End User or Client requests or authorizes </li>\n<li>If the information is provided to: (1) comply in good faith with applicable laws, rules, regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, or subpoenas.\n(2) enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements.\nor (3) protect our rights, property, or safety or the rights, property, or safety of our users or any other person or entity</li>\n<li>If the disclosure is done as part of, including as part of due diligence for, a purchase, transfer, or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, any information we have may be one of the transferred assets) or in the event of bankruptcy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even when you no longer access the SDKs, we may continue to use and share your Information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nHow We Use and Share Information Collected on the OneSignal Website(s) </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Website Information We Collect </strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect the following information from visitors to our websites (the \u201c<strong>OneSignal Website Information </strong>\u201d, including the website on which this Privacy Policy appears (\u201c<strong>OneSignal Website(s)\u201d): </strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Volunteered: </strong> You may share information with us on the OneSignal Websites when you request information from us, fill out a form on our website, or interact with us in other ways.\nThis information may include personal information, such as your name, email address, and other contact information.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Passively Collected (e.g., Cookies and Unique IDs): </strong> We use automated mechanisms, such as cookies, pixels, and other locally stored objects (such as \u201cIndexedDB)\u201d) that we associate with unique identifiers in order to keep track of visitor interactions with the OneSignal Websites.\n(You can learn more about these technologies below in the Section titled \u201c<strong>Cookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs </strong>\u201d).\nWe may use third party-services such as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from which you came to our website, and the times of your access to the OneSignal Website.\nIn addition, as you browse our website, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in.\nOur display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the OneSignal Website.\nTo \u201copt out\u201d of having your information used to tailor ads to you in this way by third party ad platforms that we may work with or provide data to, please review the Section below titled \u201c<strong>Consumer Control and Opt Out Options </strong>\n<strong>\u201d </strong> to learn how to opt-out of these services and instead receive generic, non-tailored ads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Use the OneSignal Website Information </strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the uses described above, we use the OneSignal Website Information (alone or in combination) to provide, market, and operate the OneSignal Websites and Services.\nAmong other things, by collecting the OneSignal Website Information, we are able to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maintain and offer access to the OneSignal Websites and Services and optimize how they\u2019re offered to our Clients.</li>\n<li>Send information about our products and services, including marketing communications.</li>\n<li>Respond to your questions, concerns, or customer service inquiries.</li>\n<li>Customize the content and advertising you see on the OneSignal Websites, across the Internet, and elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Share the OneSignal Website Information </strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may share the OneSignal Website Information as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As part of a business sale, merger, consolidation, investment, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation, or in connection with steps taken in anticipation of such an event (e.g., due diligence).</li>\n<li>With our corporate affiliates.</li>\n<li>With third parties that help us to provide the OneSignal Websites or Services, such as entities that help us make the OneSignal Websites or Services available and functional (such as hosting services).\nentities that help us make available or transmit any information we hold (such as helping us send emails, process payments, and manage customer information).\nand entities that help us (including our contractors, agents, and affiliates) provide technical, customer, billing, administrative, event planning, marketing or operational services to us or our Clients.</li>\n<li>When required by law or in response to lawful process, such as a subpoena, or to cooperate in good faith with a request from a government or law enforcement agency or official.\n</li>\n<li>If we believe sharing the information may prevent physical, financial or other harm, injury or loss.\nor we believe is necessary to protect our, or any other person\u2019s or entity\u2019s, interests.\nor in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual unlawful activity.</li>\n<li>We also may disclose your information under circumstances not mentioned here with your prior consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nCookies, Pixel Tags and SDKs </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and Pixel Tags.\n</strong>Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier.\nCookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your device or browser.\nOur servers may send your device a cookie when you visit the OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and Partners may do likewise on our Websites, our Clients\u2019 websites, and elsewhere.\nA pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages.\nWhen you access web pages on which a pixel tag is deployed, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit OneSignal, our Clients or Partners to set or read cookies.\nPixel tags are used in combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device.\nIf you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit.\nOneSignal, alone or with our Clients and Partners, may use cookies to, among other things, \u201cremember\u201d you (e.g., when you visit the OneSignal Websites or the websites of our Clients or Partners), track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients\u2019 or Partners\u2019 websites or interact with advertising.\nWe and partners we work with use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests.\nWe may sometimes use other locally stored objects in ways similar to how we use cookies.\nOften, these objects are deleted when you clear your browser cookie cache, but because this may not always occur (depending on the browser you use), we recommend that if you wish to opt out of notification features or third party interest-based advertising you instead follow the steps we have set forth in Section 7 titled \u201c<strong>Consumer Control &amp.\nOpt-Out Options.\n</strong>\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.\n</strong> We may use or work with partners who use mobile SDKs (including our own SDKs, which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Services and those using our Services.\nThe SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.\nWe may use this technology, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\n</strong>\n<strong>Data Controller for Personal Data and Data Processor for Clients </strong>\n</p>\n<p>OneSignal is the data controller for processing of your Personal Data.\nWe act as a data processor (or service provider) in relation to the Services we provide to our Clients.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> 7.\nPrivacy Rights </strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may have the following privacy rights;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update or request deletion

<strong>withdraw your consent </strong> at any time.\nWithdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>\n<li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority </strong> about our collection and use of your Personal Data.\nFor more information, please contact your local supervisory authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their

Personal Data to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>\n<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Data is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your Personal Data).</p>\n<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Data, please contact us at Privacy@OneSignal.com.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nProcessing Personal Information (California Residents Only) </strong>\n</p>\n<p>As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.\nHowever,

received by each category of third-party recipient.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can request to exercise your information, access and deletion rights by contacting us at Privacy@OneSignal.com.\nWe will need to confirm your identity and California residency to process your information, access or deletion requests, and we reserve the right to confirm your California residency.\nGovernment identification may be required.\nIf you wish to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, we will need to verify both your and your agent\u2019s identities and your agent must provide valid power of attorney or other proof of authority acceptable to us in our reasonable discretion.\nWe cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and
