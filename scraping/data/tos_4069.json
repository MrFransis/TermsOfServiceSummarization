or information to our Designated Agent.\nAbsent prior express permission, our Designated Agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to accept valid DMCA Notices is expressly disclaimed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information regarding notification and takedown requirements can be found in the DMCA, here: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Abuse Notification:</u>\n</strong> Abusing the DMCA Notice procedures set forth above, or misrepresenting facts in a DMCA Notice or counter-notification, can result in legal liability for damages, court costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees under federal law.\nSee 17 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 512(f).\nThese Notice and Takedown Procedures only apply to claims of copyright infringement by copyright holders and their agents \u2013 not to any other kind of abuse, infringement, or legal claim.\nWe will investigate and take action against anyone abusing the DMCA notification or counter-notification procedure.\nPlease ensure that you meet all legal qualifications before submitting a DMCA Notice to our Designated Agent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Respond to Take Down Notices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The following \u201cnotification and takedown\u201d procedures apply upon receipt of any notification of claimed copyright infringement.\nItemFix reserves the right at any time to disable access to or remove any material or activity accessible on the Site that is claimed to be infringing or from which infringing activity is apparent based on facts or circumstances.\nIt is the firm policy of ItemFix to terminate the account of repeat copyright infringers, when appropriate, and ItemFix will act expeditiously to remove access to all material that infringes on another\u2019s copyright, according to the procedure set forth in 17 U.S.\nC.\n\u00a7 512 of the DMCA.\nItemFix\u2019s DMCA Notice Procedures are set forth in the preceding paragraphs.\nIf the Notice does not comply with \u00a7 512 of the DMCA but does comply with three requirements for identifying sites that are infringing according to \u00a7 512 of the DMCA, ItemFix shall attempt to contact or take other reasonable steps to contact the complaining party to help that party comply with the notification requirements.\nWhen the Designated Agent receives a valid Notice, ItemFix will expeditiously remove and/or disable access to the infringing material and shall notify the affected user.\nThen, the affected user may submit a counter-notification to the Designated Agent containing a statement made under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed because of misidentification of the material.\nAfter the Designated Agent receives the counter-notification, it will replace the material at issue within ten to fourteen (10-14) business days after receipt of the counter-notification unless the Designated Agent receives notice that a court action has been filed by the complaining party seeking an injunction against the infringing activity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to Submit a Counter-Notification</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If a user is affected by a DMCA removal and believes that the allegedly infringing material has been removed as a result of mistake or misidentification, the user is permitted to submit a counter-notification pursuant to \u00a7 512(g)(2)-(3) of the DMCA.\nA counter-notification is the proper method for a user to dispute the removal or disabling of material pursuant to a Notice.\nThe information that a user provides in a counter-notification must be accurate and truthful, and the user will be liable for any misrepresentations which may cause any claims to be brought against ItemFix relating to the actions taken in response to the counter-notification.</p>\n<p>To submit a counter-notification, please provide our Designated Agent the following information:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (a) A specific description of the material that was removed or disabled pursuant to the Notice.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b) A description of where the material was located on the Site before such material was removed and/or disabled (preferably including specific URLs associated with the material).\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n</p> (c) A statement reflecting the user\u2019s belief that the removal or disabling of the material was done erroneously.\nFor convenience, the following language may be used: <p>\n<em>\u201cI swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the referenced material was removed or disabled by the service provider as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> (d) The user\u2019s physical address, telephone number, and email address.\nand, (e) A statement that the user consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court in and for the judicial district where the user is located, or if the user is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the user will accept service of process from the person who provided the Notice, or that person\u2019s agent.\n<p>Written counter-notification containing the above information must be signed and sent to:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lawrence G.\nWalters, Esq.<br>\n<strong>Walters Law Group</strong>\n<br> 195 W.\nPine Ave.<br>

Agent.\nAbsent prior express permission, our Designated Agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to accept valid DMCA Notices is expressly disclaimed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After receiving a DMCA counter-notification, our Designated Agent will forward it to ItemFix, and we will then provide any counter-notification to the claimant who first sent the original Notice identifying the allegedly infringing content.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, within ten to fourteen (10-14) business days of ItemFix\u2019s receipt of a counter-notification, ItemFix will replace or cease disabling access to the disputed material provided that ItemFix or our Designated Agent have not received notice that the original claimant has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Site\u2019s system or network.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>English Language</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All DMCA notices and counter-notifications must be written in the English language.\nAny attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters
