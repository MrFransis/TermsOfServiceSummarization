forth our policy with respect to information that is collected from visitors to the Site and users of the App and/or the Services.\nUnder applicable law, Discord, Inc.\nis the \u201cdata

below:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information You Provide</strong>: We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you register for access to the Services or use certain Services.\nInformation we collect may include but not be limited to username, email address, and any messages, images, transient VOIP data (to enable communication delivery only) or other content you send via the chat feature.</p>OTHER INFORMATION:<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Data We Collect Automatically</strong>: When you interact with us through the Services, we receive and store certain information such as an IP address, device ID, and your activities within the Services.\nWe may store such information or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by affiliates, agents or service providers.\nThe Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of messages users have sent, as well as the sites which refer visitors to Discord.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated Information</strong>: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the information collected.\nThis research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners.\nWe may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Info through other Services</strong>: You may give us permission to collect your information in other services.\nFor example, you may connect a social networking service (\"SNS\") such as Facebook or Twitter to your Discord account.\nWhen you do this, it allows us to obtain information from those accounts (for example, your friends or contacts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>: We employ cookies and similar technologies to keep track of your local computer\u2019s settings such as which account you have logged into and notification settings.\nCookies are pieces of data that sites and services can set on your browser or device that can be read on future visits.\nWe may expand our use of cookies to save additional data as new features are added to the Service.\nIn addition, we use technologies such as web beacons and single-pixel gifs to record log data such as open rates for emails sent by the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may use third party web site analytic tools such as Google Analytics on our website that employ cookies to collect certain information concerning your use of our Services.\nHowever, you can disable cookies by changing your browser settings.\nFurther information about the procedure to follow in order to disable

or websites.\nAfter clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our Service, you will become a user of the Service.\nAdvertising platforms, which include Twitter and Facebook (and whose SDKs are integrated within our Service), may collect information for optimizing advertising campaigns outside of the Service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties outside of the Discord Service, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).\nOur Services currently do not respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) signals and operate as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received, as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.</p>WHERE INFORMATION IS PROCESSED<p>The Company is based in the United States.\nNo matter where you are located, you consent to the processing and transferring of your information in and to the U.S.\nand other countries.\nThe laws of the U.S.\nand other countries governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live.</p>OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION<p>We use the information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you provide information for a certain reason, we may use the information in connection with the reason for which it was provided.\nFor instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.\nAlso, if you provide information in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the \u201cRelated Companies\u201d) may also use your information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services.\nThe Company and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.\nIf we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to \"opt-out\" of receiving future marketing communications.\nIn addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>OUR LEGAL BASES FOR HANDLING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA<p>The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data.\nTo the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To honor our contractual commitments to you: Much of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to our users, or to take steps at users\u2019 request in anticipation of entering into a contract with them.\nFor example, we handle personal data on this basis to create your account and provide our Services.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Legitimate interests: In many cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals: This includes:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing a safe and enjoyable user experience;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customer service;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing, e.g.\nsending emails or other communications to let you know about new features;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Protecting our users, personnel, and property;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Analyzing and improving our business, e.g.\ncollecting information about how you use our Services to optimize the design and placement of certain features;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Processing job applications;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Managing legal issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal compliance: We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To protect the vital interests of the individual or others: For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent medical situation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consent: Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of your implied or express consent.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION<p>The Company is not in the business of selling your information.\nWe consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.\nThere are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your information with certain third parties, as set forth below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.\nIn the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, bankruptcy, dissolution or similar event, your information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent</strong>: We may transfer your information with your consent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Related Companies</strong>: We may also share your information with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Developers</strong>: Developers using our SDK or API will have access to their end users\u2019 information, including message content, message metadata, and voice metadata.\nDevelopers must use such information only to provide the SDK/API functionality within their applications and/or services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</strong>: Like many businesses, we sometimes hire other companies or individuals to perform certain business-related functions.\nExamples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of the Company or Related Companies, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated or Non-identifiable Data</strong>: We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others for business purposes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>UNSOLICITED INFORMATION<p>You may provide us with ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, \u201cUnsolicited Information\u201d).\nAll Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>CHILDREN<p>Our Services are for users age 13 and over and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.\nIf you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has disclosed personal information to us please contact us at dis.gd/request and select \"Parent of a user\" as your report type option.\nNote: In some countries, the age of digital consent is older than 13.\nIf you are in those countries, you must be at least that age to use the Services.\nFor example, for residents of the EEA, where processing of personal information is based on consent, Discord will not knowingly engage in that processing for users under the age of consent established by applicable data protection law.\nIf we learn that we are engaged in that processing with such users, we will halt such processing and will take reasonable measures to promptly remove applicable information from our records.</p>LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services.\nThe Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by us (the \u201cThird Party Sites\u201d).\nThe policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites.\nThe links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites.\nWe suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>DATA RETENTION<p>We generally retain personal data for so long as it may be relevant to the purposes identified herein.\nTo dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps.\nData may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.</p>SECURITY<p>We take reasonable steps to protect the information provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.\nHowever, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free.\nIn particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure.\nTherefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email.\nPlease keep this in mind when disclosing any information via the Internet.</p>YOUR DATA RIGHTS AND CHOICES<p>We believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are, and so we are making the following options to control your data available to all users, regardless of their location.</p>\n<p>You can update certain information by accessing your profile via \u201cSettings.\u201d You can also unsubscribe from certain emails by clicking the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link they

Canada, Costa Rica and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances.\nThey may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect.\nThey also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>How can I access the personal data you have about me?</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like to submit a data access request, you can do

MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>\n<p> You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p> Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration.\nIn the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute.\nThis notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it.\nYou must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.\nMail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p>\n<p> The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.</p>\n<p> Binding Arbitration.\nExcept as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S.\nstate in which you reside.\nFor residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.\nDiscord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p> The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms.\nIf there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.</p>\n<p> To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost.\nDiscord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.\nYou are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nDiscord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney\u2019s fees.\nDiscord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nDiscord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>\n<p> If Discord\u2019s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p> You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.\nHowever, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.\nMail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Opt-Out Right</u>.\nYou have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com.\nThe notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service.\nIf you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.\nIf you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either.\nIf any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Survival</u>.\nThis Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service.</p>CLASS WAIVER<p> THIS SECTION AND THE PREVIOUS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.</p>\n<p> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</p>\n<p> Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</p>\n<p> The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).\nAnd, the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Discord customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.</p>\n<p> If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims, or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in San Francisco, California.</p>\n<p> This Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.</p>INTERNATIONAL USE.\nEXPORT CONTROLS<p> Software available in connection with the Service and the transmission of applicable data, if any, is subject to United States export

"https://discord.com/guidelines", "xpath": "/html/body/div[1]/div/div/div[2]/div", "text": "Discord Community Guidelines<p>\n<strong>Last Updated: May 19th, 2020.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We created Discord to help people come together around games.\nIt's been amazing to watch it grow into what it is today - a place where millions of diverse communities exist and people connect with old friends and new.\nWe can't wait to see what's next.</p>\n<p>Our community guidelines are meant to explain what is and isn\u2019t allowed on Discord, and ensure that everyone has a good experience.\nIf you come across a message that appears to break these rules, please report it to us.\nWe may take a number of steps, including issuing a warning, removing the content, or removing the accounts and/or servers responsible.</p>\n<p>The overwhelming majority of people use Discord responsibly, so these guidelines may seem obvious.\nStill, we want to be clear about the expectations for our users.\nEvery user of Discord should feel like their voice can be heard, but not at the expense of someone else.</p>Here are some rules for interacting with others:<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Do not organize, participate in, or encourage harassment of others.</strong> Disagreements happen and are normal, but continuous, repetitive, or severe negative comments may cross the line into harassment and are not okay.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do not organize, promote, or coordinate servers around hate speech.</strong> It\u2019s unacceptable to attack a person or a community based on attributes such as their race, ethnicity, national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, or disabilities.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others.</strong> This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone\u2019s private personal information (also known as doxxing).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do not evade user blocks or server bans.</strong> Do not send unwanted, repeated friend requests or messages, especially after they\u2019ve made it clear they don\u2019t want to talk to you anymore.\nDo not try to hide your identity in an attempt to contact someone who has blocked you, or otherwise circumvent the tools we have which enable users to protect themselves.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Do not send others viruses or malware</strong>, attempt to phish others, or hack or DDoS them.</li>\n</ol>Here are some rules for content on Discord:<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>You must apply the NSFW label to channels if there is adult content in that channel.</strong> Any content that cannot be placed in an age-gated channel, such as avatars, server banners, and invite splashes, may not contain adult content.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not sexualize minors in any way.</strong> This includes sharing content or links which depict minors in a pornographic, sexually suggestive, or violent manner, and includes illustrated or digitally altered pornography that depicts minors (such as lolicon, shotacon, or cub).\nWe report illegal content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not share sexually explicit content of other people without their consent</strong>, or share or promote sharing of non-consensual intimate imagery (also known as revenge porn) in an attempt to shame or degrade someone.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not share content that glorifies or promotes suicide or self-harm</strong>, including any encouragement to others to cut themselves, or embrace eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not share images of sadistic gore or animal cruelty.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not use Discord for the organization, promotion, or support of violent extremism.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not operate a server that sells or facilitates the sales of prohibited or potentially dangerous goods.</strong> This includes firearms, ammunition, drugs, and controlled substances.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not promote, distribute, or provide access to content involving the hacking, cracking, or distribution of pirated software or stolen accounts.</strong> This includes sharing or selling cheats or hacks that may negatively affect others in multiplayer games.</li>\n<li>In general, <strong>you should not promote, encourage or engage in any illegal behavior.</strong> This is very likely to get you kicked off Discord, and may get you reported to law enforcement.</li>\n</ol>Finally, we ask that you respect Discord itself:<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not sell your account or your server.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not use self-bots or user-bots to access Discord.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not share content that violates anyone's intellectual property or other rights.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may not spam Discord</strong>, especially our Customer Support and Trust &amp.\nSafety teams.\nMaking false and malicious reports, sending multiple reports about the same issue, or asking a group of users to all report the same content may lead to action being taken on your account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you see any activity that violates these guidelines, you can report it to us by filling out this form.</p>",

ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.</p>\n<p> PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>\n<p> You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p> Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration.\nIn the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute.\nThis notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it.\nYou must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.\nMail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p>\n<p> The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.</p>\n<p> Binding Arbitration.\nExcept as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S.\nstate in which you reside.\nFor residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California.\nDiscord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p> The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) and under the rules set forth in these Terms.\nIf there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern.\nARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nYou may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state\u2019s law.</p>\n<p> To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost.\nDiscord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous.\nYou are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney\u2019s fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law.\nThe decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.\nDiscord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney\u2019s fees.\nDiscord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nDiscord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>\n<p> If Discord\u2019s or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.</p>\n<p> You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief.\nHowever, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S.\nMail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Opt-Out Right</u>.\nYou have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com.\nThe notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service.\nIf you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.\nIf you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either.\nIf any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Survival</u>.\nThis Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service.</p>", "case_id": 339, "document_id": 2648, "quoteStart": 31269, "quoteEnd":
