by applicable law, rule or regulation.\nAfterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.\nFor example, if you verified your company\u2019s stack profile, but delete your personal user account and user profile, the company stack profile you created will not automatically be deleted, unless you manually delete it.</p>\nWhat Security Measures Do We Use?\n<p>We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity.\nFor example, we use two-factor authentication for many services we use internally and have begun to use a central password management solution.</p>\nPersonal Data of Children\n<p>\nWe do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16.\nIf you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to

Personal Data, please contact us at\nprivacy@stackshare.io.\n</p>\nWhat Rights Do You Have Regarding Your Personal Data?\n<p>\nYou have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including

comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision.\nIn some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and
