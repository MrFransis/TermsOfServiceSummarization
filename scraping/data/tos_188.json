information?\"\n<p>For us, \"personal information\" means information which either directly identifies you (like your name, email address, or billing information) or can be reasonably linked or combined to identify you (like an account identification number or IP address).\nWe\u2019ll always tell you what personal information we\u2019re collecting from you.\nSee each product\u2019s Privacy Notice for specific details.</p>\n<p>Any information that falls outside of this is \"non-personal information.\"</p>\n<p>If we store your personal information with information that is non-personal, we will consider the combination as personal information.\nIf we remove all personal information from a set of data then the remaining is non-personal information.</p>\nHow do we learn information about you?\n<p>We learn information about you when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you give it to us directly (e.g., when you choose to send us crash reports);</li>\n<li>we collect it automatically through our products and services (e.g., when your Firefox browser checks with us to see if is up to date);</li>\n<li>someone else tells us information about you (e.g., when Thunderbird works with your email providers to set up your account).\nor</li>\n<li>when we try and understand more about you based on information you've given to us (e.g., when we use your IP address to customize language for some of our services).</li>\n</ul>\nWhat do we do with your information once we have it?\n<p>When you give us information, we will use it in the ways for which you've given us permission.\nGenerally, we use your information to help us provide and improve our products and services for you.</p>\n<p>For users in the EU, EEA, Switzerland, and California: see here for more information.</p>\nWhen do we share your information with others?\n<ul>\n<li>When we have asked and received your permission to share it.</li>\n<li>For processing or providing products and services to you, but only if those entities receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by Mozilla.</li>\n<li>When we are fulfilling our mission of being open.\nWe sometimes release information to make our products better and foster an open web, but when we do so, we will remove your personal information and try to disclose it in a way that minimizes the risk of you being re-identified.</li>\n<li>When the law requires it.\nWe follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit.\nWe'll notify you when we're asked to hand over your personal information in this way unless we're legally prohibited from doing so.\nWhen we receive requests like this, we'll only release your personal information if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so.\nNothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.</li>\n<li>When we believe it is necessary to prevent harm to you or someone else.\nWe will only share your information in this way if we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Mozilla or the public.</li>\n<li>If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt) we may pass your information to a successor or affiliate.</li>\n</ul>\nHow do we store and protect your personal information?\n<p>We are committed to protecting your personal information once we have it.\nWe implement physical, business and technical security measures.\nDespite our efforts, if we learn of a security breach, we'll notify you so that you can take appropriate protective steps.</p>\n<p>We also don't want your personal information for any longer than we need it, so we only keep it long enough to do what we collected it for.\nOnce we don't need it, we take steps to destroy it unless we are required by law to keep it longer.</p>\nWhat if we change this privacy policy or any of our privacy notices?\n<p>We may need to change this policy and our notices.\nThe updates will be posted online.\nIf the changes are substantive, we will announce the update through Mozilla's usual channels for such announcements such as blog posts and forums.\nYour continued use of the product or service after the effective date of such changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes.\nTo make your review more convenient, we will post an effective date at

Notice March 8, 2021 <p>We care about your privacy.\nWhen Mozilla (that's us) collects information about you, our Mozilla Privacy Policy describes how we handle that information.</p>\n<p>This privacy notice applies to Mozilla operated websites and mobile apps, which include the domains mozillians.org, mozilla.org, and firefox.com, among others.\nThis includes, for example, foundation.mozilla.org, bugzilla.mozilla.org, reps.mozilla.org, careers.mozilla.org, developers.mozilla.org, support.mozilla.org, addons.mozilla.org, and wiki.mozilla.org.</p> Things you should know\n<p>We may receive personal information from you based on your interaction with us on social media platforms.\nif you submit a job, intern, grant, or fellow application.\nif you volunteer as a Mozilla community member.\nif you submit user feedback or a request to us.\nif you sign up for an account or for a subscription.\nor if you engage with a product or policy campaign.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>: If you engage with our social media accounts, such as Twitter and Facebook, we may receive personal information about you.\nIf you use these networks, their privacy policies apply, and you are encouraged to read them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Job, Intern, Grant &amp.\nFellow Applicants</strong>: Applicants for employment, internship, grant, or fellowship opportunities with Mozilla are required to give us a name, street address, telephone number, email address, and resume, and sometimes additional information as well.\nWe use this information to process and evaluate applications and to communicate with applicants about opportunities.\nWe use Greenhouse to handle employment and intern applications, and Fluxx.io to handle fellowship and MOSS grant applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Contributors</strong>: Volunteering for Mozilla as a community contributor may require Mozilla and others to communicate with you at the email address that you provide in connection to your contribution and to recognize your efforts.\nIf you contribute to Bugzilla, Mozilla Reps, or our code base, then your email address and possibly your name will be publicly available to all internet users.\nIf you create a profile at Mozillians.org, it will be accessible to Mozilla employees and Mozilla contributors.\nYou can edit your profile data at Profile Settings.\nWe sometimes use contributor information from sources (such as Bugzilla) in dashboards to visually share aggregated data on the Mozilla community.\nAn example is https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Dashboards.\nIf possible, we try to minimize contact information that is publicly displayed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>User Feedback</strong>: You can provide feedback to us on our products and services on webpages like input.mozilla.org, through an in-product experience, or through channels such as email, Bugzilla, Matrix, a social media account, our Get Involved page, or through a group like Student Ambassadors.\nPlease minimize the personal information you choose to share on these forums because your comments may be accessible to the public.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Accounts &amp.\nSubscriptions</strong>: Some websites, for example AMO and MDN require account creation to submit developer content or submit user reviews or comments.\nFor account management we use Firefox Accounts, Github, or custom systems.\nsee here to manage account data.\nYou may periodically receive emails in connection with your account or through subscriptions.\nOur email management vendors are SalesForce Marketing Cloud, Send in Blue, Mailchimp, or Acoustic and you can unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of the email.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Product &amp.\nPolicy Campaigns</strong>: Some of our webpages host product or policy campaigns.\nFor example, you can request a link by email or SMS to install Firefox on your mobile device or petition your legislators on internet issues.\nWe may use third parties to manage these campaigns and handle any data that you choose to submit.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use cookies, clear GIFs, third party web analytics, device information, and IP addresses for functionality and to better understand user interaction with our products, services, and communications.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Functionality</strong>: We may use information such as cookies, device information, and IP addresses to enhance functionality of certain products, services, and communications.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use cookies to remember information about your Firefox settings (such as language preference and Firefox add-ons), and so that we can recommend relevant features and Add-ons to you based on your Firefox settings.\nThey also assist with user sign-in and authentication so you can bypass re-entering your passwords on certain Mozilla websites.</li>\n<li>We use IP addresses to customize communications by language and country.</li>\n<li>We use certain device information such as country, language, operator and OEM, to customize your experience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Metrics</strong>: We may also use cookies, device information, and IP addresses, along with clear GIFs, cookies and third party services to help us understand in the aggregate how users engage with our products, services, communications, websites, online campaigns, snippets, devices, and other platforms.\nWe use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Analytics, which places a cookie on your device, to obtain metrics on how users engage with our websites.\nThis helps us to improve site content.</li>\n<li>Convert.com and ShareProgress, which place a cookie on your device, to help us test variations of web content.\nThis helps us offer better web experiences to users.</li>\n<li>DoubleClick and Flashtalking, each of which uses a clear GIF on our download Firefox page.\nThis helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>\n<li>Yahoo Dot Pixel, which uses JavaScript on our download Firefox page.\nThis helps us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.</li>\n<li>HTTP Referral Data, which may be included with Firefox\u2019s installer, to understand the website domain or advertising campaign that referred you to our download page.\nThis information helps us understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and improve them.</li>\n<li>Other metrics tools from time to time, on an experimental basis.\nFor example, we may do this to help evaluate a new metrics tool, or test existing metrics collection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Fraud Prevention</strong>: Mozilla has implemented third-party technology, Google\u2019s Invisible reCAPTCHA, that operates in the background on some of our websites in order to identify fraudulent activity.\nUse of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is governed by the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can control individual cookie preferences, indicate your cookie preferences to others, and opt-out of web analytics and optimization tools.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie History</strong>: You can accept or decline individual cookies in your Firefox preferences in the Tools/Options/Privacy history section.\nNote that certain features of our products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track</strong>: Mozilla does not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising.\nIf you have configured your browser to send a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal when accessing our websites, Mozilla will not utilize any of the tools described in the Metrics section.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Email</strong>: Our marketing communications are optional to receive and you can unsubscribe from the footer of the email or by updating your Mozilla email preferences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Analytics &amp.\nOptimization</strong>: Follow the instructions below to prevent data collection about your visits to Mozilla websites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google: Install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, which prohibits data transmission to Google Analytics.\nSome Mozilla.org pages use clear GIFs which communicate with DoubleClick to understand the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.\nyou can control personalized ads from DoubleClick in Google's ad settings (you will be prompted to sign into your Google Account).</li>\n<li>Convert.com: Opt-out on www.mozilla.org.</li>\n<li>Yahoo: Visit the Ad Interest Manager to opt-out.</li>\n<li>ShareProgress and Fathom.com: You can turn on Do Not Track in your browser.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media</strong>: The social sharing buttons on Mozilla websites are designed not to share data with the social media provider until you specifically click the button.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some Mozilla websites allow you to make purchases (such as apps or gear), contribute funds to specific Mozilla projects, or make donations in support of Mozilla public and charitable programs.\nThese transactions are often handled by Mozilla\u2019s third party vendors.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment Processing</strong>: Except for payments made by check, money order, and direct debit, and wire transfers, Mozilla does not receive any financial information, which is transmitted from you to the named third party vendor for processing (e.g., Braintree, PayPal, Bitpay, Stripe).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Data</strong>: We may also receive your name, mailing address, and/or email address.\nThis data is used for fraud detection and record-keeping.\nWe use Acoustic to email receipts and store records, which are retained for four years from the date of last payment.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Data</strong>: We use WealthEngine to improve our fundraising efforts to keep the internet healthy, open, and accessible for all.\nDonors can opt-out of Mozilla\u2019s use.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>

"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/", "xpath": "/html/body/div[3]/div/article", "text": " Firefox Privacy Notice Effective May 28, 2021 At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet.\n<p>That\u2019s why we build Firefox, and all our products, to give you greater control over the information you share online and the information you share with us.\nWe strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox for everyone.</p>\n<p>In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less.\nWe also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla privacy policy for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox.</p> Firefox by default shares data to:\nImprove performance and stability for users everywhere<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Interaction data</strong>: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows.\nnumber of webpages visited.\nnumber and type of installed Firefox Add-ons.\nand session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical data</strong>: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language.\ndevice operating system and hardware configuration.\nmemory, basic information about crashes and errors.\noutcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us.\nWhen Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the telemetry documentation for Desktop, Android, or iOS or learn how to opt-out of this data collection on Desktop and Mobile.</p> Set a default search provider\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Location data</strong>: When you first use Firefox, it uses your IP address to set your default search provider based on your country.\nLearn more.</li>\n</ul>\nSuggest relevant content<p>Firefox displays content, such as \u201cSnippets\u201d (messages from Mozilla), Add-on Recommendations, Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Firefox users), and Pocket Recommendations (which is part of the Mozilla family).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Location data</strong>: Firefox uses your IP address to suggest relevant content based on your country and state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical &amp.\nInteraction data</strong>: Firefox sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with Firefox\u2019s suggested content.\nThis includes the number of times suggested content is displayed or clicked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Webpage data for Snippets</strong>: When you choose to click on a Snippet link, we may receive data about the link you followed.\nThis information is not associated with any other information about you.\nLearn more.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Webpage, Language, and Location data for Pocket Recommendations</strong>: We recommend content to you based on your browsing history, language, and country location.\nThe process of deciding which stories you should see based on your browsing history happens locally in your copy of Firefox, and neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browsing history.\nTo help you see relevant Pocket Recommendations based on your location, Firefox shares your language and country location with Pocket.</p>\n<p>Mozilla and Pocket receive aggregated data about the recommendations you see and click.\nWe also share aggregated data about the sponsored content you see and click with our third-party ad platform Adzerk so advertisers can see how many people click on their articles.\nThis aggregated data does not identify you personally.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Location data and Interaction data for Top Sites</strong>: When you click the Amazon.com Top Site tile on New Tab, we share your country and the time you clicked with Amazon and AdMarketplace (a third-party referral platform) to verify you navigated to Amazon.\nFirefox does not share your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you with either Amazon or AdMarketplace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Add-on and Feature Recommendations</strong>: We recommend Add-ons in two places: the Manage Your Extensions Page (about:addons) and the Awesome Bar, where you search or type in URLs.\nWe may also recommend Firefox Features in the Awesome Bar.\nWe base the recommendations in about:addons on a cookie.\nWe base the recommendations in the Awesome Bar on your interaction with Firefox.\nMozilla does not receive your browser history.\nThe process happens locally in your own computer\u2019s copy of Firefox.\nLearn More about Awesome Bar recommendations or Extensions Page recommendations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Improve security for users everywhere<p>\n<strong>Webpage data to DNS Resolver service</strong>: For some Firefox users in the United States, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla\u2019s strict privacy standards for resolvers.\nThis provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks.\nSystem logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution.\nLearn more or see our default DNS resolver service providers below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cloudflare</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>NextDNS</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Comcast</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical data for updates</strong>: Desktop versions of Firefox check for browser updates by persistently connecting to Mozilla servers.\nYour Firefox version, language, and device operating system are used to apply the correct updates.\nMobile versions of Firefox may connect to another service if you used one to download and install Firefox.\nLearn more.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical data for add-ons blocklist</strong>: Firefox for Desktop and Android periodically connect to Mozilla to protect you and others from malicious add-ons.\nYour Firefox version and language, device operating system, and list of installed add-ons are needed to apply and update the add-ons blocklist.\nLearn more.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Webpage and technical data to Google\u2019s SafeBrowsing service</strong>: To help protect you from malicious downloads, Firefox sends basic information about unrecognized downloads to Google's SafeBrowsing Service, including the filename and the URL it was downloaded from.Learn more or read Google\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nOpting out prevents Firefox from warning you of potentially illegitimate or malicious websites or downloaded files.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities</strong>: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with \"HTTPS\"), Firefox validates the website's certificate.\nThis may involve Firefox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website.\nOpting out increases the risk of your private information being intercepted.\nLearn more.</p> Crash reports<p>By default on desktop versions of Firefox, we will ask you to share a report with more detailed information about crashes with Mozilla, but you always have the choice to decline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Sensitive data</strong>: Crash reports include a \u2018dump file\u2019 of Firefox\u2019s memory contents at the time of the crash, which may contain data that identifies you or is otherwise sensitive to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Webpage data</strong>: Crash reports include the active URL at time of crash.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical data</strong>: Crash reports include data on why Firefox crashed and the state of device memory and execution during the crash.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read the full documentation here.</p> Measure and

policy.\nMobile campaign data includes a Google advertising ID, IP address, timestamp, country, language/locale, operating system, and app version.\nRead the documentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> If you use these features, Firefox will share data to provide you functionality and help us improve our products and services:\nSearch<p>You can perform searches directly from several places in Firefox, including the Awesome Bar, Search Bar, or on a New Tab.\n<em>Mozilla does not receive your search queries.</em> We do receive data about how you engage with search in Firefox and the number of searches you request from our search partners.\nQuery data is sent to your search provider, which has its own privacy policy.\nLinks to our default search providers are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Google</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Microsoft (Bing)</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Yandex</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Search Suggestions</strong>: Firefox by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience.\nThese data will not be sent if your selected search provider does not support search suggestions.</p>\n<p>Learn more, including how to disable this feature.</p> Firefox Accounts &amp.\nJoin Firefox<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Registration

Monitor</li>\n<li>Firefox Notes</li>\n<li>Firefox Send</li>\n<li>Firefox Sync</li>\n</ul> Sync<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Synced data</strong>: If you enable Sync, Mozilla receives the information that you sync across devices in encrypted form.\nThis may include Firefox tabs, add-ons, passwords, payment autofill information, bookmarks, history, and preferences.\nDeleting your Firefox Account will delete related Firefox Sync content.\nYou can also read the documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Technical and Interaction data</strong>: If you enable sync, Firefox will periodically send basic information using Telemetry about the most recent attempt to sync your data, such as when it took place, whether it succeeded or failed, and what type of device is attempting to sync.\nYou can also read the documentation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more, including how to enable or disable sync.</p> Location<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Location data to Google's geolocation service</strong>: Firefox always asks before determining and sharing your location with a requesting website (for example, if a map website needs your location to provide directions).\nTo determine location, Firefox may use your operating system\u2019s geolocation features, Wi-fi networks, cell phone towers, or IP address, and may send this data to Google's geolocation service, which has its own privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn more.</p> Website notifications<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Connection data</strong>: If you allow a website to send you notifications, Firefox connects with Mozilla and uses

recent general release version of Firefox distributed by Mozilla.\nIf you obtain Firefox elsewhere, or are running an older version, your copy of Firefox may contain different privacy characteristics.</p>\n<p>Mozilla\u2019s pre-release versions of Firefox (which are distributed through channels such as Nightly, Beta, Developer Edition and TestFlight) are development platforms frequently updated with experimental features and studies.\n&nbsp;In addition to the data collection described in this Privacy Notice, these versions by default may send certain types of web activity and crash data to Mozilla and in some cases to our partners.\nAny data collection or sharing adheres to our Firefox data collection policy and we will always be transparent and provide you with controls.</p> ", "created_at": "2020-09-30 07:51:13.138895", "updated_at": "2021-06-21 12:22:56.45948"}], "points": [{"id": 22917, "title": "Your browser's Do Not Track (DNT) headers are respected",
