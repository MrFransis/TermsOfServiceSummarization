the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter \"General Data Protection Regulation\" or \"GDPR\").\nIn particular, the definitions of Article&nbsp;4 and Article&nbsp;9 of the GDPR apply.\nFor your information we have listed the essentially relevant definitions below under (VII).</p> 2.\nScope of Personal Data Processing <p>We collect and use the personalized data of our users in principle only insofar as this is necessary to render and provide our services and to prepare our internet presence or online offers (including mobile apps).</p>\n<p>Personalized data are collected and used for other purposes on a regular basis only</p>\n<p>(i) with the user's consent,</p>\n<p>(ii) if the processing takes place for the purpose of contract performance,</p>\n<p>(iii) for the protection of legitimate interests, insofar as this is not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights of the persons affected that require the protection of personalized data.\nThis also includes the transmission of data to authorities and/or courts.</p>\n<p>Moreover, such cases are excepted in which it was not possible to obtain prior consent for practical reasons, or in which the processing of the data is permitted by statutory regulations.</p> 3.\nLegal Bases <p>Insofar as personalized data are processed on the basis of consent by the data subject, Article&nbsp;6(1a) of the GDPR is the legal basis for such processing.</p>\n<p>For the processing of personalized data for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, Article&nbsp;6(1b) of the GDPR is the legal basis.\nthis also applies for processing which is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.</p>\n<p>If personalized data are processed for the purpose of compliance with legal obligations (such as, for example, retention periods stipulated by tax or commercial law, or information provided by authorities, etc.), Article&nbsp;6(1c) of the GDPR is the legal basis.</p>\n<p>For the case that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person necessitate the processing of personalized data, Article&nbsp;6(1d) of the GDPR is the legal basis.</p>\n<p>Should processing take place in order to protect a legitimate interest of our company or of a third party, and this interest is not overridden by the interests, fundamental rights and basic freedoms of the data subject, Article&nbsp;6(1f) of the GDPR is the legal basis for processing.\nThis can be the case particularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to guarantee the operation of your FRITZ! product</li>\n<li>to guarantee the IT security of your FRITZ! product</li>\n<li>to improve the quality and function of FRITZ! products</li>\n</ul> 4.\nObtaining Consent / Right of Revocation <p>Consent in accordance with Article&nbsp;6(1a) of the GDPR is generally obtained electronically.\nThe user consents by checking the checkbox in the corresponding field for the purpose of documenting that consent was granted (opt-in procedure).\nThe contents of the consent form are logged electronically.\nThe legality of processing on the basis of other legal grounds remains unaffected by this, particularly in accordance with Article&nbsp;6(1f) of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>Right of revocation: Please note that consent already granted can be revoked prospectively at any time \u2013 in full or in part.\nthe legality of any processing that took place on the basis of consent up to the time consent was revoked remains unaffected.\nPlease direct any revocation to the contact information for the responsible authority or the data protection officer listed under (II).</p> 5.\nPossible Recipients of Personalized Data <p>In order to provide our internet and/or online services, we also employ third-party service providers (\"processors\") to act on our behalf and upon our instructions in the framework of service provision.\nIn the framework of service provision, these service providers can receive personalized data or come into contact with personalized data, and constitute third parties or recipients in the terms of the GDPR.</p>\n<p>In such cases we ensure that our service providers offer sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of this regulation and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subject (cf.\nArticle&nbsp;28 of the GDPR).</p>\n<p>Insofar as a transmission of personalized data to third parties and/or recipients outside of processing a job, we ensure that this occurs only in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR (e.g., Article&nbsp;6[4] of the GDPR) and only where there is a corresponding legal basis (e.g., Article&nbsp;6[4] of the GDPR).</p> 6.\nProcessing of Data in So-called \"Third Countries\" <p>In general, the processing of your personalized data takes place within the EU, or within the European Economic Area (\"EEA\").</p>\n<p>Only in exceptional cases (e.g., in connection with the involvement of service providers to provide web analytic services) can it happen that information is transferred to so-called \"third countries\".\n\"Third countries\" are countries outside of the European Union and/or the Agreement on the European Economic Area, in which it cannot necessarily be assumed that the level of data protection is adequate according to the standards of the EU.</p>\n<p>Insofar as the transmitted information also includes personalized data, we ensure before such a transfer that an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed in the given third country, or by the given recipient in the third country, or that you have provided your consent to such transfer, or there is another basis that permits such a transfer (e.g.\nArticle&nbsp;49 of the GDPR).\nAn adequate data protection level can arise from what is called an \"adequacy decision\" by the European Commission or be guaranteed by application of the \"EU standard contractual clauses\".\nWe are happy to provide you with further information on appropriate and suitable guarantees for adherence to an adequate level of data protection upon request.\nthe contact information is provided at the beginning of this data protection documentation.</p> 7.\nData Erasure and Storage Period <p>Personalized data on the data subject are erased or locked as soon as the purpose of processing has expired.\nData are stored after the purpose of processing has expired only when this is provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other directives to which our company is subject (e.g., to satisfy legal record-keeping requirements and/or when there are justified interests in storage e.g.\nduring the period of statutes of limitation for the purpose of legal defense against any claims).\nThe data are also deleted or locked when a storage period prescribed by the relevant standards expires, unless there is a necessity for the further storage of the data for the conclusion of a contract of for other purposes.</p> 8.\nRights of the Data Subjects <p>The GDPR grants certain rights to data subjects affected by the processing of personalized data (rights of the data subject, especially Articles&nbsp;12 through 22 of the GDPR).\nThe individual rights of the data subjects are clarified in (VIII).\nIf you would like to exercise one or more of these rights, you can contact us at any time.\nPlease do so by using the contact information listed under (II).</p> IV.\nData Processing on the Part of AVM and Data Transmission to AVM <p>For product maintenance, to ensure operational safety, and for reasons of security, AVM provides your AVM FRITZ! products with regular updates to the operating software (FRITZ!OS).\nIn order to determine the correct and/or necessary updates for your product, at regular intervals your FRITZ! product sends technical data to identify the device, the operating system used, the network provider of your line, and basic settings on the FRITZ! product, to AVM.</p>\n<p>AVM saves the technical data on your product transmitted during the search for updates in order to be able to perform a targeted update.\nIf your device is registered with MyFRITZ! (myfritz.net), these data are also used in order to display the configuration and properties of your device (see [V].)</p>\n<p>You can disable the automatic search for updates under \"Internet / Account Information / AVM Services\".\nAVM recommends leaving the automatic search for updates enabled.</p>\n<p>In the factory settings, your FRITZ! product is configured to notify you about available updates, and automatically install updates that AVM considers necessary for secure operation.\nYou can change the settings of your FRITZ!OS at any time under \"System / Update / Auto Update\".</p>\n<p>In order to improve your product, and to ensure safe operation on your line, your FRITZ! product will send technical diagnostics data to AVM as needed:</p>\n<p>The options \"Diagnostics data\" and \"Diagnostics and maintenance\" are enabled during installation.\nIn order to ensure the security and reliable operation of your product, we recommend leaving these settings enabled.\nHowever, you can change these options during installation.\nBoth options can be changed individually after installation under \"Internet / Account Information / AVM Services\".\nFor more information on this, see the \"AVM Services\" help page.</p>\n<p>With the \"Diagnostics data\" option, technical diagnostics data are transmitted by your FRITZ! product to AVM for analysis in specific cases of errors (error reports) or suspected abuse by third parties.</p>\n<p>With the \"Diagnostics and maintenance\" option, your FRITZ! product can be reached by AVM for diagnostics purposes.\nIn individual cases, AVM can retrieve selected technical diagnostics data, as for error analysis or for the purpose of support.\nIn individual cases, AVM can retrieve a summary of diagnostics data, as for error analysis or for the purpose of support.\nThis summary can be viewed under \"Internet / Account Information / AVM Services\u201c.\nAVM records a random sample of FRITZ! products to collect statistically relevant data on quality, application scenarios and ambient parameters.\nThis information serves to detect technical problems, to guide useful further development, and to make qualitative improvements measurable.\nWhen the \"Diagnostics and maintenance\" option is enabled, a randomly selected, access-protected port is opened on the FRITZ! product for communication with the FRITZ! product with the sole purpose of transmitting diagnostics data.</p>\n<p>Diagnostics data do not include any names assigned by the customer.\nInsofar as diagnostics data must be logged and evaluated, we do so in anonymized form, that is, without any reference to the person of the user.\nThis way you can benefit from optimizations implemented in updates or necessary adjustments by AVM.\nExamples of technical diagnostics data are quality and configuration parameters of the DSL, internet and Wi-Fi connections, basic performance parameters, and configurations of the FRITZ!OS operating system, as well as reports about errors or suspected abuse by third parties.</p>\n<p>In a Mesh system, the diagnostics and maintenance settings are automatically transmitted from the Mesh&nbsp;Master (FRITZ!Box hub) to the Mesh&nbsp;Repeaters (connected FRITZ! products).\nPlease make any desired changes to the settings on the Mesh&nbsp;Master.</p>\n<p>If you entered an email address for status information on your FRITZ! product during installation of your FRITZ! product, AVM keeps an account for the email address saved for this purpose.\nFor reasons of security, information on when this account was accessed by which devices, as well as information on the FRITZ! product registered with this account are saved in this account, so that you can view this information or have it sent to you by email (MyFRITZ! report) (see [V]).</p>\n<p>When you use the online help, open the Tips &amp.\nTricks, open the user manual, or register for a FRITZ! product newsletter, your FRITZ! product transmits device-specific data, like, for instance, the FRITZ!Box model and provider name, the FRITZ!OS version number, regional settings and language, as well as information on the context of the user interface in which the help was accessed, in order to enable the context-sensitive display of contents appropriate to the product being used.</p>\n<p>When the \"Sample HD sound\" feature or the \"AVM voice clip (HD)\" entry in the telephone book (or the corresponding quick-dial entry) are used on your FRITZ!Fon, a connection will be established to the HD telephony test server at AVM.\nFor this only the IP address of your FRITZ!Box for regular IP communication is transmitted.\nAVM does not process this information.</p>\n<p>In order to display the TV channel logos on cable connections, the FRITZ!Box periodically accesses list of available channel logos provided by AVM.\nFor this only the IP address of your FRITZ!Box for regular internet communication is transmitted.\nNo further processing takes place.</p>\n<p>If you send us voluntary feedback on DSL, wireless LAN, VoIP or other services or technologies, your FRITZ!Box transmits any data entered voluntarily (for instance feedback, email address, postal code) as well as device-specific data, including DSL settings, FRITZ!Box model and provider name, FRITZ!OS version number, regional setting and language, in order to be able to analyze your feedback.\nThese data are transmitted via email.\nFeedback is saved until it is no longer required for analysis, and evaluated anonymously.</p> V.\nAVM Services and Apps MyFRITZ! (myfritz.net) <p>Users must register and set up a personal account in order to use the MyFRITZ! (myfritz.net) service available online.\nThis account is set up when you enter an email address for status information on your FRITZ!Box during installation, or when you register your FRITZ!Box with MyFRITZ! at a later point in time.\nThen AVM keeps a MyFRITZ! account for the email address saved here.\nIn the context of registration and setting up a user account, we collect and save the following personal data, but do not pass them on to third parties: the user's email address, password, information on the devices that have been used to access this account (device fingerprint, operating system, browser and browser version), IP addresses of the last 10 login attempts (the IP addresses of earlier attempts are deleted), the optional individualized text (shown in the subject line of your email for security), and possible status information on your email inbox if messages bounce back from your email provider.\nIn addition, for every FRITZ!Box assigned to the MyFRITZ! account, AVM saves technical data for identification (for instance, device address [MAC address], FRITZ!Box name and the like) as well as the user name of the local user on the FRITZ!Box so that this information can be pre-allocated when MyFRITZ! internet access is configured.</p>\n<p>Your passwords are saved only in hashed form and can be neither viewed nor recalculated by AVM.\nThe data transmitted during registration are erased if registration is not concluded within 48&nbsp;hours by clicking the confirmation link.\nIn the case of irregularities in your MyFRITZ! account or anomalies or peculiarities with one of the devices registered there, AVM can contact the email address saved with the account.</p>\n<p>Registration of the user serves to restrict and control access to the contents and services that we offer only to registered users on our MyFRITZ! web pages.</p>\n<p>The legal bases for processing data for the purpose of registration and account administration and account use are Article&nbsp;6 (1b) of the GDPR and Article&nbsp;6(1f) of the GDPR, since registration is simultaneously for the purpose of restricting and/or controlling access and for the protection of contents and information we developed.</p>\n<p>The data transmitted during registration are erased if registration is not concluded within 48&nbsp;hours by clicking the confirmation link.</p>\n<p>If you delete your account with MyFRITZ! all of the data associated with the account will be erased.</p>\n<p>As a user you have the option to terminate or delete your registration with MyFRITZ! at any time under \"Account Settings / Delete Account\".\nThe data stored about you in MyFRITZ! can be modified at any time.</p>\n<p>AVM saves the technical data on your product transmitted during the search for updates in order to be able to perform a targeted update (see [VI]).\nIf your device is registered with MyFRITZ! (myfritz.net), these data are also used in order to display the configuration and properties of your device or send them by email.</p>\n<p>MyFRITZ! can send email to the email address assigned to the MyFRITZ! account.\nThese emails contain the individualized text specified for the MyFRITZ! account, if such a text was configured.</p>\n<p>MyFRITZ! regularly sends a MyFRITZ! report about the FRITZ! products registered with the MyFRITZ! account.\nThis function can be enabled and disabled.</p>\n<p>For your security, MyFRITZ! notifies you by email about new devices registering with the MyFRITZ! account.</p>\n<p>AVM reserves the right to contact the user of the MyFRITZ! account by email in the case of anomalies with the MyFRITZ! account or one of the devices registered with it.</p>\n<p>The MyFRITZ! website uses \"Google reCAPTCHA\" (hereinafter \"reCAPTCHA\").\nThis software is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (\u201cGoogle\u201d).</p>\n<p>It serves to protect MyFRITZ! and its users from misuse through automatic spying and from spam.</p>\n<p>For more information on Google reCAPTCHA and on Google's privacy policy, go to the following links: policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en and google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html.</p>\n<p>For statistical evaluation of the usage of the MyFRITZ! web pages we use Matomo web analytics.\nThis service analyzes only navigation to and usage of the MyFRITZ! web pages.\nAny other websites you visited remain unknown to us, and are neither saved nor tracked.</p>\n<p>No cookies are used for this process and the requesting IP address is anonymized for transmission.</p>\n<p>To simplify communication with your FRITZ!Box registered with MyFRITZ!, AVM operates a dynamic DNS (DynDNS) server.\nFor this your FRITZ! product transmits its IP address to the DynDNS server, which saves only the IP address of your FRITZ!Box that is currently valid in the constant subdomain.\nOutdated IP address are deleted immediately.</p>\n<p>If you configure MyFRITZ! access on a device connected to a FRITZ!Box registered with MyFRITZ!, you allow access to this device (via the opened ports) from the internet under a subdomain of the constant subdomain belonging to myfritz.net.\nThe device name of the device is used as the subdomain.\nExample: Fileserver1.drfh40jierq5we2rtz.myfritz.net \u2013 if your device is called Fileserver1.</p>\n<p>When you open the link to the AVM Newsletter from the MyFRITZ! web pages, for your convenience, the email address of your MyFRITZ! account is automatically pre-allocated to receive the AVM Newsletter and thus transmitted to AVM.</p>\n<p>You can change this email address for receiving the AVM Newsletter.\nFor data protection information regarding the AVM Newsletter, see the privacy policy on our web pages at en.avm.de.</p> FRITZ!Apps <p>FRITZ!Apps offer you additional functions for your FRITZ! product, some at home, and some from on the go.\nIn order to use your app, data required in order to register with the FRITZ!Box are stored in the app and transmitted, usually in encrypted form, for communication with the FRITZ!Box.</p>\n<p>In FRITZ!Apps, the personalized data of the contacts available on the device, from your FRITZ!Box telephone books, and from linked telephone books, are used only within the FRITZ!App to fulfill the functions offered there.\nContacts and telephone books can contain, for instance, telephone numbers, names, email addresses, and additional personal data.\nThese data will not be passed on to AVM nor to any third parties.</p>\n<p>After they have been configured on a FRITZ!Box, FRITZ!Apps automatically use this function to be notified by the FRITZ!Box about new events.\nThis communication takes place from the FRITZ!Box via AVM directly to the notification service for Android devices provided by Google, or for iOS devices provided by Apple, via the battery conserving transmission deployed in many apps.\nIn the context of regular internet communication the IP addresses of your FRITZ!Box and of the device are used.\nCommunication takes place in encrypted form.\nOver this route the FRITZ!Box transmits the events of the FRITZ!Box so that they can be processed and displayed in the app.\nFor this, supplementary user data like telephone numbers, email addresses or names are transmitted end-to-end in encrypted form.\nthese can be decrypted only by your FRITZ!Box and the apps registered with it.</p>\n<p>To improve the functionality, user friendliness and security of your FRITZ!Apps, AVM receives certain information about the use of your FRITZ!Apps.\nFor this the FRITZ!Apps use Google Analytics, Google Firebase, and Google Fabric, web analytics services from Google (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.\n\"Google\") and App Analytics von Apple (One Apple Park, CA 95014, USA.\n\"Apple\").</p>\n<p>For this purpose the FRITZ!Apps transfer to these services anonymized information about the use of the FRITZ!App and any errors that occur.\nIn case of errors, precise details about register codes and device information are sent in order to facilitate maintenance of the FRITZ!Apps.\nYou may reject the recording of this anonymized data and their processing by disabling this option at any time.\nThe generated information is sent in anonymized form to a Google or Apple server and saved there.\nOn this basis the usage of the app will be analyzed and listed in aggregated and anonymized reports on app activities for AVM.</p>\n<p>If required by law, or if third parties process the data on Google's or Apple's behalf, Google or Apple can transmit these data to third parties where necessary.</p>\n<p>The Google Analytics Option \"anonymizeIp\" is used in FRITZ!Apps to guarantee the anonymized collection of IP addresses (also known as IP masking).\nIn the course of this IP anonymization your IP address is shortened before transmission within the member states of the EU or to other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\nOnly in exceptional cases is the complete IP address transmitted to a Google server in the US and shortened there.</p>\n<p>For more information, see https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en (general information on Google Analytics and data privacy) and at fabric.io/terms.</p>\n<p>If you use the microphone or the camera of your smartphone for certain FRITZ!Apps, such as for audio transmission, or to record a photograph or video, the contents will be used only in the app.\nfor transmissions over networks (for instance, by telephone) directly into your home network or via the internet, your data will not be transmitted to AVM.\nDepending on the configuration, the data are transmitted in the internet in encrypted or non-encrypted form.\nThe FRITZ!App&nbsp;Fon transmits voice data in the home network without encryption.</p>\n<p>If you send us voluntary feedback from the FRITZ!Apps, your app transfers specific diagnostics data so that we can analyze your feedback.\nTransmission takes place using the app you selected for sending (in encrypted or non-encrypted form).\nFeedback is saved until it is no longer required for analysis.</p> VI.\nData Transfer to Third Parties <p>In accordance with its intended use, the product connects with one or more telecommunications service providers (for services like internet access, TV and telephony).\nThe corresponding interfaces of the providers and/or the services they render are operated through the product, and the data necessary for these services are exchanged with the given provider.\nYour FRITZ!Box may communicate with your service provider for the provisioning, updating and maintenance of your FRITZ!Box.\nThe kind and purpose of such data transmission and data processing are explained in the documentation supplied by your provider.</p>\n<p>If you enable the services of other service providers in your FRITZ!Box through optional (voluntary) configurations, the data required for these interfaces will be exchanged with the service provider.\nSuch services may include push mail (email dispatch via SMTP), DynDNS, online storage (WebDAV), online contacts, online address book, Domain Name Server (DNS), certificate from letsencrypt.org, time server (NTP), messages (RSS feed), podcasts and web radio.\nFor such uses, service-specific addresses and parameters, and in some cases a user name and password, are required by the given service and entered by the user.\nThese are saved in encrypted form in the FRITZ!Box.\nThese data are neither evaluated nor transferred outside of communication with these services.\nCommunication with the services is encrypted whenever possible (depending on the configuration).\nEvery time you connect to the internet for DynDNS service, your FRITZ!Box transmits the current public IP address and the entered login data at regular intervals.\nIf you use the option \"Use certificate from letsencrypt.org (recommended)\" for MyFRITZ! access to your FRITZ!Box from the internet, the FRITZ!Box has an SSL certificate issued by the letsencrypt.org certificate authority for your MyFRITZ! address (subdomain from myfritz.net).\nFor this the transmission of the IP address and the MyFRITZ! address of the FRITZ!Box is required.\nDuring certification, a port on the FRITZ!Box is opened briefly so that letsencrypt.org can check that the MyFRITZ! address is legitimate.\nThe certificate is renewed at regular intervals in the same way.</p>\n<p>Like most certification authorities, letsencrypt.org publishes a list of all of the certificates it issues, and thus also the MyFRITZ! addresses certified there.\nThe privacy policy of letsencrypt.org is presented at letsencrypt.org/privacy.\n<br>This option is effective only for FRITZ!Box products with MyFRITZ! access from the internet configured and can be disabled under \"Internet / MyFRITZ! Account\".</p> VII.\nDefinitions <p>The definitions are in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free
