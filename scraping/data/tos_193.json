Notice<ul>\n<li>A Do Not Track (DNT) standard has not been adopted to this day, and therefore LinkedIn doesn't use DNT signals.</li>\n<li>Except as described in Privacy Policy, LinkedIn doesn't authorize the collection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from our members on LinkedIn for third party use through advertising technologies without separate member consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about DNT and LinkedIn's DNT practices, please read on:</p>\n<p>On September 27, 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law A.B.\n370, amending the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) to require website operators like LinkedIn to disclose how LinkedIn responds to DNT Signals.\nand whether third parties collect personally identifiable information (PII) about users when they visit LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Do Not Track (DNT)</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>What is DNT?</em>\n</p>\n<p>DNT is the concept that has been promoted by regulatory authorities, in particular the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What is a DNT signal?</em>\n</p>\n<p>Currently, various browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari) offer a DNT option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header that sends a signal to websites visited by the browser user about the user's DNT preference.\nYou can usually access your browser's DNT option in your browser's preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Is there a DNT technology standard?</em>\n</p>\n<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard.\nWhile some progress has been made on this issue, it has been slow, and to date no standard has been adopted.\nWithout an industry standard for DNT, users cannot know how any given company abides by a DNT signal they receive from browser headers.\nLinkedIn is committed to remaining apprised of the W3C efforts to develop a DNT standard.</p>\n<p>\n<em>How does LinkedIn respond to the signal?</em>\n</p>\n<p>LinkedIn takes privacy and security very seriously and strives to put our members first in all aspects of our business.\nWith regard to DNT, LinkedIn currently doesn't respond to DNT signals in browsers because no DNT standard has been adopted, as noted above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>What about JavaScript buttons like Share on LinkedIn?</em>\n</p>\n<p>When someone visits websites that contain JavaScript buttons (\"plugins\"), like LinkedIn's Share button, we receive plugin passive impression data that we depersonalize immediately.\nWhen members actively interact with our plugins (for example, sharing articles on LinkedIn), we keep this information to provide respective functionality and improve their, and others' LinkedIn experience.\nLearn more about how we use and protect plugin data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Does LinkedIn share members' personally identifiable information with third parties (like advertisers and ad networks)?</em>\n</p>\n<p>As the world's largest professional network, our hundreds of millions of members come to LinkedIn to connect with other members, find jobs, and be found by other members for any number of professional reasons.\nLinkedIn is, inherently, a public place, and there is a lot of PII on LinkedIn that is viewable by any visitor.\nIn other words, third parties can find out about you from the info you share on our services.</p>\n<p>In the DNT context, however, LinkedIn doesn't authorize the identification of LinkedIn members by third parties through advertising technologies deployed in ads that may appear on LinkedIn without separate consent.</p>\n<p>Please note, that our Privacy Policy uses the definition of \"direct marketing\" provided by the California Civil Code \u00a71798.83, to include marketing directly to individuals by means of mail, phone, or e-mail for personal purposes.</p>\n<p>Last updated: 2 months ago</p>Was this answer

you.\nThis Cookie Policy applies to any LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference.\nWe use cookies and similar technologies such as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as \u201ccookies\u201d) to collect and use data as part of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy (\u201cServices\u201d).</p> What technologies are used? <p>ENTER A SUMMARY</p> Type of technology Description Cookies <p>A cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality.\nAny browser visiting our sites may receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers.\nWe or third parties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies.\nA persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is used for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it\u2019s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our Services without signing in again.\nSince a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to one of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services.\nSession cookies last only as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).</p> Pixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit information) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails.\nWe use pixels to learn more about your interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts.\nPixels can also enable us and third parties to place cookies on your browser.\nLocal storage Local storage enables a website or application to store information locally on your device(s).\nLocal storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling features, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality.\nOther similar technologies We also use other tracking technologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy.\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Our cookie tables list some of the cookies that are used by us and third parties as part of our Services.\nPlease note that these tables may be updated from time to time to provide you with the latest information.</p> What are these technologies used for? <p>Below we describe the ways in which we may use cookies.</p>\n<p>ENTER SUMMARY</p> Purpose Description Authentication <p>We use cookies to recognize you when you visit our Services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re signed into LinkedIn, cookies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line with your settings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Security <p>We use cookies to make your interactions with our Services faster, more secure and to help us detect malicious activity and violations of our User Agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Preferences, features and services <p>We use cookies to enable the functionality of our Services, and provide you with features, insights and customized content.\nWe also use these technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Functional <p>We use cookies to improve your experience on our Services.</p> Plugins on and off LinkedIn <p>We use cookies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our plugins may be found on LinkedIn or third-party sites, such as the sites of our customers and partners.\nIf you interact with a plugin, the plugin will use cookies to identify you and initiate your request.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can learn more about plugins here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Personalized Advertising <p>Cookies help us show you relevant advertising, both on and off our Services and measure the performance of such ads and report on it.\nWe use cookies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone who was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another site.\nSimilarly, our partners or service providers may use cookies to determine whether we\u2019ve shown an ad or a post and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you\u2019ve visited a customer\u2019s or partner\u2019s site or application.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4&nbsp;and&nbsp;2.4&nbsp;of the Privacy Policy.</p> Analytics and research <p>Cookies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.\nWe or our service providers use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including as you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices.\nWe or our service providers, use cookies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn whether you have interacted with our or our customers\u2019 websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also use cookies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with our Services on that browser for up to 30 days in order to generate usage analytics for our Services.\nWe may share these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p> What third parties use these technologies in connection with our Services? <p>Third parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.</p>\n<p>For example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for their own marketing purposes.\nFor an illustration, please visit&nbsp;LinkedIn\u2019s Help Center.</p>\n<p>Third parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services.\nThird parties may use cookies to help us to provide our Services.\nWe may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to analyze and research our Services.</p> Your Choices <p>You have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies.\nPlease note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to use cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be as personalized to you.\nIt may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.</p> Targeted Advertising <p>As described&nbsp;here, you have choices regarding the use of your personal data for targeted advertising.\nSome mobile device operating systems such as Android and iOS provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads personalization.\nYou can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer\u2019s website for both Android and iOS.</p> Browser Controls <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of cookies.\nFurther, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies.\nTo learn more about browser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.</p> Manage Cookie Preferences <p>Where required, we enable you to reject the use of certain cookies for purposes such as advertising and analytics and research, by visiting your cookie settings, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on your consent before its withdrawal.\nFor members, your settings can be found&nbsp;here.\nFor guests, your settings can be found&nbsp;here.&nbsp;You can change your preferences at any time by visiting these settings.&nbsp;Learn more.</p> What is Do Not Track (DNT)? <p>DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S.\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings.\nAs such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals.</p> Other helpful resources <p>To learn more about advertisers\u2019 use of cookies, please
