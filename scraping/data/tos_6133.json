YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\n</strong>\n<i>\n</i> In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather

is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims.\nIf any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.\n<i>\n</i>\n<strong> YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Tenamax Male Enhancement IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
