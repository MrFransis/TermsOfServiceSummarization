between this SLA and the CDNsun Terms of Service, the CDNsun Terms of Service\nwill govern.\n</p>\nService Commitment\n<p>\nCDNsun will use commercially reasonable effort to make the CDN Service\navailable with a 30 Days Uptime Percentage (defined below) of 100%.\nIn the event\nCDNsun does not meet the Service Commitment, Customer may be eligible to receive a Service Credit (defined below) as described below.\n</p> Definitions\n<ul>\n<li>\n\"30 Days Period\" is the last 30 days preceding the moment when the account\nrequested Service Credit (defined below) including the day when

\"Service\nUnavailable\" divided by the total number of requests during that\nfive minute period.\nCDNsun will calculate the Error Rate for each CDNsun\naccount as a percentage for each five minute period in the 30 Days Period.\nThe calculation of the number of internal server errors will not\ninclude errors that arise directly or indirectly as a result of any of\nthe CDNsun SLA Exclusions (defined below).\n</li>\n<li>\n\"30 Days Uptime Percentage\" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the average of the\nError Rates from each five minute period in the 30 Days Period.\n</li>\n<li>\n\"30 Days Expense\" is the Customer's expense within the 30 Days Period for CDN traffic.\nThe 30 Days Expense does not include any other expenses\nsuch as expenses for

CDNsun\naccount by adding it to Customer\u2019s balance for CDN Service.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> A Service Credit shall not entitle Customer to any refund or\nother payment from CDNsun.\n</li>\n<li>\nA Service Credit will be applicable and\nissued only if the Service Credit amount for the applicable 30 Days Period is\ngreater than or equal to fifty US dollars ($50 USD).\n</li>\n<li> A Service Credit can be applied at most once for an incident.\n</li>\n<li>\nA Service Credit may not be\ntransferred or applied to any other CDNsun account.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Customer\u2019s sole and exclusive remedy
