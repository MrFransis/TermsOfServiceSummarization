Account.\nYou may not create an Account or use the Jagex Product if you are under the age of 13 and it is a violation of our Terms to register an Account on behalf of someone under this age.\nWhere an applicable age rating body (e.g PEGI, ESRB, USK) or platform (e.g Apple, Google Play) classifies a particular Jagex Product as suitable to be played only by users of a specified age above 13 years old, then in such circumstances, users (even if Account holders) below this classified age shall not be entitled to play, use or access the particular Jagex Product until they have reached the specified age classification.\nIn all other circumstances, for users between 13 and 18 years of age, subject to the exceptions set out above and the laws of your country of residence (including the applicable age rating classification allocated to the Jagex Product by the relevant age rating authority and/or platform) and you obtaining your parents\u2019/guardians\u2019 prior consent, you will

information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will Stop the Account.</p>\n<p>If you are under 18, by using the Jagex Product you are representing (i.e.\nmaking a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our Terms.\nWe may Stop any Account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.\nYou and your parent(s) or guardian(s) must review these Terms together.\nParents and guardians are responsible for the acts of children under 18 years of age when using the Jagex Products.\nWe recommend that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on devices they provide their child.</p>\n<p>If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has misrepresented their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the Account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian of that child.</p>\n<p>Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the Parents' Guide</p>\n5.\nSafety and abuse\n<p>Before using any Jagex Product you should read the safety information.\nParents of those users under the age of 18 should also review this information.</p>\n<p>You should be aware of the potential risks of using a service which includes extensive User Content.\nUser Content may be inaccurate, out of date or otherwise inappropriate.\nWe cannot guarantee that users will comply with our Terms, rules or otherwise behave appropriately.\nYou should not assume that a person is who he or she claims to be.\nIn your own interests, you should not attempt to contact any user outside a Jagex Product.</p>\n<p>If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should report such inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game \"Report abuse\" button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities.\nIf you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Products.\nAlternatively, please contact our customer support team</p>\n<p>We are under no obligation to actively monitor and/or moderate User Content.\nWe do however undertake very limited monitoring detailed below.\n</p>\n<p>Anti-Cheat Technologies</p>\n<p>We may use anti-cheat technologies in relation to the Jagex Products.\nWhen you connect online to a game server, these technologies may activate and monitor your game play, the files on your computer associated with the Jagex Product or that otherwise access our servers, and your computer's memory, purely for the purposes of detecting and preventing cheating.</p>\n<p>If any of these anti-cheat technologies detect cheating, we may collect relevant information necessary for our investigation and enforcement purposes, including your Account name, details about the unauthorized third party program and the Jagex Product files modification detected, and the time and date it was detected.\nWe also may terminate these Terms, your access to the Jagex Products, and your Jagex Account if we determine you have been cheating.</p>\n<p>Chat Monitors</p>\n<p>We do not actively monitor chat between users.\nWe have systems that monitor chat for certain keywords and provide us with a selection of high-risk User Content to review.\n</p>\n<p>Further we review any chat that contains phrases supplied to us by the Internet Watch Foundation and relate to child protection issues or where a user indicates in chat that they are under 13 years old.</p>\n<p>We also review chat logs if we have a reasonable suspicion that a user may be contemplating suicide or harming other users or third

be given the opportunity to purchase a license (or in our sole discretion, acquire a license as a free promotion) of: (i) Virtual Currencies, and/or (ii) credits that can be redeemed to play micro-games ( <strong>\"Micro-Game Credits\"</strong>).\nVirtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits can be redeemed (i.e.\nused) to acquire certain digital goods/services in the Jagex Product, which we describe below as <strong>\"Items\"</strong>.\nIf you obtain a license to use such Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits from Jagex, you must check that they have been correctly credited to your Account and tell us immediately if not.\nIf you confirm you wish to purchase or acquire a license to such Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits (as applicable), we will only be legally bound to provide you with such a license of the Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits (as applicable) if we (or our third party operators) subsequently notify you of our acceptance in response to your confirmation and only once the Virtual Currencies and Micro-Game Credits are made available as part of the Jagex Product.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that when you obtain your Virtual Currencies and/or Micro-Game Credits from us or our authorized partners, you receive a personal, limited, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable, non-exclusive, revocable license to access and select the rights and entitlements that Jagex expressly makes available to you associated with such Virtual Currencies and/or Micros-Game Credits and only in respect of the applicable Jagex Product.\nThe Virtual Currencies

MICRO-GAME CREDITS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VERY IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS:</p>\n<p>Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits may expire if they have not been redeemed within a certain period after

limit, twelve months from acquisition.</p>\n<p>Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits can only be redeemed within the world of the relevant Jagex Product where you acquired them.\nEach Jagex Product may contain one or more Virtual Currencies or Micro-Game Credits and unless otherwise stated, each Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit is independent and is not exchangeable for any other Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credit in the same Jagex Product.\nWE MAY AT ANY TIME IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION CHANGE OR REMOVE ANY ITEM WHICH CAN BE ACQUIRED USING VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS, AS WELL AS CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS NEEDED TO ACQUIRE A PARTICULAR ITEM.\nYou may only redeem Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits for Items on offer at the time of redemption.</p>\n<p>Virtual Currency and Micro-Game Credits do not have any inherent monetary value and are not your own private property.\nWhen you purchase or acquire the license to use Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits, you do not own the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits.\nInstead they constitute an element of your license in the relevant Jagex Product.\nSimilarly, any Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits balance shown in your Account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored monetary value in any real-world currency.</p>\n<p>We do not provide any cash or refunds for Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits or Items (except as required by law) and Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items do not have any real-world monetary value.\nVirtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits are for your personal use only and as part of your Account with the relevant Jagex Product.\nYou must not sell or transfer, trade, or exchange them (whether by itself or by transferring your Account) or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things.\nVirtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value, and cannot be inherited.\nWe may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of Virtual Currency, Micro-Game Credits and Items.\nFor example, we may cap the amount of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits which can be acquired, held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence.\nCERTAIN ITEMS MAY ALSO ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO SUBSCRIBERS.</p>\n<p>FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, VIRTUAL CURRENCY AND MICRO-GAME CREDITS HAVE NO CASH VALUE, DO NOT ACCRUE INTEREST AND, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR ANY SUM OF MONEY OR MONETARY VALUE FROM JAGEX AT ANY TIME.</p>\n<p>Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits: (1) if you have misused the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits.\n(2) if you have breached or may breach any of these Terms.\n(3) if the Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits were awarded in error.\n(4) if a payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits is charged back or otherwise cancelled or

payment for Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits used to purchase the Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed.\nIn addition, Items that have been acquired by the redemption of Virtual Currency or Micro-Game Credits may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition.\nIn addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of a Jagex Product.</p>\n<p>WE MAY AT ANY TIME DECIDE TO END IN PART OR ITS ENTIRETY THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS PROGRAM FOR ALL OR ANY OF OUR JAGEX PRODUCTS.\nBEFORE WE DELETE THE UNUSED VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR MICRO-GAME CREDITS, WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO CONTACT YOU TO GIVE A REASONABLE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH TO REDEEM THEM.</p>\n<p>Jagex Product Bonds</p>\n<p>Where applicable, within certain Jagex Products, users may be entitled to purchase from us, a bond (\u201c<strong>Jagex Product Bonds</strong>\u201d).\nThese Jagex Product Bonds can be used to redeem or trade against certain other Virtual Currencies, Micro-Game Credits, subscriptions Items, any promotion Items run by Jagex, and any other particular virtual product or service in the relevant Jagex Product (these collectively as \" <strong>Redemption Items</strong>\").\nAll Jagex Product Bonds are redeemable or tradeable in the relevant Jagex Product and cannot be redeemed or traded across different Jagex Products.\nFor example, in relation to the Jagex Product Old School RuneScape, users can purchase an Old School Jagex Product Bond from Jagex.\nOld School Jagex Product

law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).\nIt also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.\nThe GDPR aims primarily to give control to citizens and residents over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.\nThe Data Protection Act 2018 (\u201cDPA 2018\u201d) sets out the framework for data protection law in the UK.\nIt updates and replaces the Data Protection Act 1998 and came into effect on 25 May 2018.\nIt sits alongside the GDPR, and tailors how the GDPR applies in the UK - for example by providing exemptions.\nIt also sets out separate data protection rules for law enforcement authorities, extends data protection to some other areas such as national security and defense, and sets out the Information Commissioner\u2019s functions and powers.</p>\n1.\nImportant information

and obtain your consent to do so.</p>\n<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>\n5.\nDisclosure of your personal data\n<p>We may share your personal data with third parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4

transfers\n<p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside

Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU/US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n7.\nData security\n<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered, disclosed or being unavailable.\nIn addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know on the principle of least privilege (PoLP) .\nThey will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.\nWe periodically review all privacy and security policies and update when necessary in line with changes of the GDPR or when any new technologies are introduced into our business.\nWhere the introduction of new technologies results in a high risk to your data we will perform a data protection impact assessment and will only proceed if meeting the required levels of security standards.\nMethods of collecting personal information are reviewed by management before they are implemented to confirm that personal information is obtained (a) fairly, without intimidation or deception, and (b) lawfully, adhering to all relevant rules of law, whether derived from statute or common law, relating to the collection of personal information</p>\n<p>We have put in place

including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\nA copy of our Data Retention Schedule is available upon request.</p>\n<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>\n<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six tax years plus current tax year as part of our legal obligations to do so.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <em>Request erasure</em> below for further information.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>\n9.\nYour legal rights\n<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.\nWe set out below a brief description of such rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To be informed</strong>: Individuals have the right to be informed about the collection and use of their personal data.\nThis is a key transparency requirement under the GDPR and DPA 2018.\nThis Privacy and our cookie policy meet this requirement.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Request access to your personal data</strong>\n<strong>(commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d)</strong>: This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Request rectification of your personal data</strong>: This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Request erasure of your personal data</strong>: This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Object to processing</strong>\n<strong>of your personal data</strong>: Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Request restriction of processing your personal data</strong>: This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy.\nor (b) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Request the transfer</strong>\n<strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party</strong>: We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong>\n<strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data</strong>: However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please Contact us.</p>\nNO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\nAlternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>\nWHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\nTIME LIMIT TO RESPOND\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, in which case we will inform you of an extension period of up to 2 months as stated in the GDPR and DPA 2018.\nIn this case, we will keep you informed on progress.</p>\n10.\nCalifornia Residents: Your California Privacy Rights\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy
