discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions.\nYou also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.\nThis section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests, to the extent Sangoma acts as a \u201cbusiness\u201d (as opposed to a \u201cservice provider\u201d) for purposes of handling personal information.&nbsp.\n(To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.)</p>\n<p>a.\nRight to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>California residents may opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of their personal information.\nCalifornia law broadly defines what constitutes a \u201csale\u201d \u2013 including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d.\nWe do not, and will not, sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>b.\nRight to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information</p>\n<p>You may also request that we delete any personal information that we have collected directly from you (note that this is different from your right to \u201copt-out\u201d of us selling your personal information, which is described above).\nHowever, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.&nbsp.\nIf you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to apply for employment at Sangoma.</p>\n<p>c.\nRight to Request Access to Your Personal Information</p>\n<p>California residents also have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information we collect, use, or sell.&nbsp.\nAs a California resident, you may request access to the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you.</p>\n<p>California residents may learn more how to exercise these rights of information access by sending an email to legal@sangoma.com or by mail sent to Sangoma US Inc., Attn: Legal, 445 Jan Davis Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806.\nWe will only use the information you submit to respond to your request, and we may need to identify you and your state of residence before we can respond.</p>\n<p>However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information, or where we cannot verify your identity in relation to such personal information.&nbsp;Thus, for security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity \u2013 partly by requesting certain information from you \u2013 when you request to exercise certain of your California privacy rights.</p>\n<p>Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern by doing so.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you with additional information about the reasons why we could not comply with your request.</p>\n<p>d.\nRight to Nondiscrimination.&nbsp;We do not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.</p>\n<p>e.\nInformation About Persons Under 16 Years of Age</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in California unless we have received legal consent to do so.\nIf we learn that personal information from such California residents has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to remove their information from our database (or to obtain legally required consent).</p>\n<p>f.\nAuthorized Agents</p>\n<p>You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above.\nWe will take steps to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf by providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.</p>\n<p>g.\nDisclosure of Personal Information, No Sale</p>\n<p>Over the preceding twelve (12) months, we disclosed certain categories of California residents\u2019 personal information to the categories of third parties as shown in the table above.\nWe do not and will not sell California residents\u2019 personal information.</p>\n<p>13.\nGeneral</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Unsubscribing from and subscribing to email

reside in the state of California, in addition to following the above procedures detailed under \u201cGeneral\u201d above, Sangoma also protects your personal information in accordance with section 1798.100 (b) of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nThe CCPA defines \u201cpersonal information\u201d as, \u201ccategories of information that identifies, relates to, describes or is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly to a particular individual or household.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Your California Rights and Choices</p>\n<p>Without being discriminated against for exercising these rights, California residents have the right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect from you, to delete that information, and to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, subject to certain restrictions.\nYou also have the right to designate an agent to exercise these rights on your behalf.\nThis section describes how to exercise those rights and our process for handling those requests, to the extent Sangoma acts as a \u201cbusiness\u201d (as opposed to a \u201cservice provider\u201d) for purposes of handling personal information.&nbsp.\n(To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a reasonable fee to comply with your request.)</p>\n<p>a.\nRight to Opt-Out of the Sale of Your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>California residents may opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of their personal information.\nCalifornia law broadly defines what constitutes a \u201csale\u201d \u2013 including in the definition making available a wide variety of information in exchange for \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d.\nWe do not, and will not, sell your personal information.</p>\n<p>b.\nRight to Request Deletion of Your Personal Information</p>\n<p>You may also request that we delete any personal information that we have collected directly from you (note that this is different from your right to \u201copt-out\u201d of us selling your personal information, which is described above).\nHowever, we may retain personal information for certain important purposes, such as (a) to protect our business, systems, and users from fraudulent activity, (b) to address technical issues that impair existing functionality (such as de-bugging purposes), (c) as necessary for us, or others, to exercise their free speech or other rights, (d) to comply with law enforcement requests pursuant to lawful process, (e) for scientific or historical research, (f) for our own internal purposes reasonably related to your relationship with us, or to comply with legal obligations.&nbsp.\nIf you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to apply for employment at Sangoma.</p>\n<p>c.\nRight to Request Access to Your Personal Information</p>\n<p>California residents also have the right to request that we disclose what categories of your personal information we collect, use, or sell.&nbsp.\nAs a California resident, you may request access to the specific pieces of personal information that we have collected from you.</p>\n<p>California residents may learn more how to exercise these rights of information access by sending an email to legal@sangoma.com or by mail sent to Sangoma US Inc., Attn: Human Resources, 445 Jan Davis Drive, Huntsville, Alabama 35806.\nWe will only use the information you submit to respond to your request, and we may need to identify you and your state of residence before we can respond.</p>\n<p>However, we may withhold some personal information where the risk to you or our business is too great to disclose the information, or where we cannot verify your identity in relation to such personal information.&nbsp;Thus, for security purposes (and as required under California law), we will verify your identity \u2013 partly by requesting certain information from you \u2013 when you request to exercise certain of your California privacy rights.</p>\n<p>Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Where you have requested the categories of personal information that we have collected about you, we will provide a list of those categories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where you have requested specific pieces of personal information, we will provide the information you have requested, to the extent required under the CCPA and provided we do not believe there is an overriding privacy or security concern by doing so.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we are unable to complete your requests fully for any of the reasons above, we will provide you with additional information about the reasons why we could not comply with your request.</p>\n<p>d.\nRight to Nondiscrimination.&nbsp;We do not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights.</p>\n<p>e.\nInformation About Persons Under 16 Years of Age</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under 16 years of age in California unless we have received legal consent to do so.\nIf we learn that personal information from such California residents has been collected, we will take reasonable steps to remove their information from our database (or to obtain legally required consent).</p>\n<p>f.\nAuthorized Agents</p>\n<p>You may also designate an agent to make requests to exercise your rights under CCPA as described above.\nWe will take steps to verify the identity of the person seeking to exercise their rights as listed above, and to verify that your agent has been authorized to make a request on your behalf by providing us with a signed written authorization or a copy of a power of attorney.</p>\n<p>g.\nDisclosure of Personal Information, No Sale</p>\n<p>Over the preceding twelve (12) months, we disclosed certain categories of California residents\u2019 personal information to the categories of third parties as shown in the table above.\nWe do not and will not sell California residents\u2019 personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>For EU,
