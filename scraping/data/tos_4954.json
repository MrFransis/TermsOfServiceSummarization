arbitrate disputes with City Hive and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to info@CityHive.net within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Services.</p>\n<p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nHOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS AS A COURT WOULD.</p>\n<p>If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to City Hive\u2019s Customer Service Center of your intent to arbitrate (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to City Hive should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to info@CityhHive.net or (ii) U.S.\nPostal Service certified mail to City Hive, Inc., Attn: Customer Service Center, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich, #2968, New York, NY, 10007.\nThe Notice must: (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\n(y) set forth the specific relief sought.\nand (z) set forth your name, address and contact information.\nIf we intend to seek arbitration against you, we will send any notice of dispute to you at the contact information we have for you.\n&nbsp;If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or City Hive may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) under its AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these Terms.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules are available at&nbsp;ADR.org&nbsp;or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms.\nIf you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules.\nWe will reimburse all other AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse City Hive for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nCity Hive will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, based solely on written submissions or in person in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at a mutually agreed location.\n&nbsp;The arbitration will be conducted in the English language.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\n&nbsp;No claim or action arising from or concerning the Services or otherwise hereunder may be brought later than one (1) year from the date the claim or cause of action arose.\n&nbsp;The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.</p>\n<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nFurther, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\n&nbsp;If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and we each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and the exercise of personal jurisdiction of the state or federal court located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the purpose of litigating all claims or disputes, and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.\nWe also both agree that City Hive may bring suit in court for injunctive relief to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>You may contact us regarding the Services or these Terms at: City Hive, Inc., 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich St., New York, NY, 10007, or by email to:
