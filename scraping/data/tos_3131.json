more detail on your choices regarding online advertising.<br>\n<br>Disclosures to protect us or others.\nWe may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external

your, our or others' rights, property, or safety.\nenforce our policies or contracts.\ncollect amounts owed to us.\nor assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.\nIn particular, if we receive a report that you have violated our policies (like our Positive Play Charter at https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/charter), we may disclose that report and other relevant information to the platform on which you play our games, such as Sony (PlayStation\u00ae4 system or PlayStation\u00ae5 console), Microsoft (Xbox), and others.<br>\n<br>Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfer.\nIn the event of a reorganization, divestiture, merger, sale, or bankruptcy, we may transfer all information we

you to connect and play with friends and members of a game's community, regardless of what platform they play on.\nFor example, someone on an Xbox could join a match with a player who is using a PlayStation\u00ae4 system or PlayStation\u00ae5 console.\nWe call this ability to match players across platforms \"Cross-Play.\" When Cross-Play is enabled and you play with someone on another platform, that other platform may receive your platform's ID (such as Xbox Gamertag, or Online ID of your account for PlayStation\u2122Network) along with other information necessary to enable Cross-Play.\nIn addition, we may provide information regarding your use of Cross-Play features to the platform on which you play our games.\nYou can change your Cross-Play preferences by visiting the

these features.\nYour information received by these platforms may be subject to their respective privacy notices.<br>\n<br>With Your Consent.\nWe may share information with other third parties with your express consent, unless otherwise described above.\nFor example, you may agree to us sharing your information with a certain company or organization to hear about their products, services, or promotions, or if you tell us that you want to link your EA Account with another company\u2019s services.\nUse of the information you agree to share will be subject to those third parties' respective privacy notices.<br>\n<br>5.\nWhere We Hold Your Information<br>\n<br>Personal information we collect may be stored and processed for the purposes set out in this Privacy and Cookie Policy in the United States or any other country in which EA, its subsidiaries, or third-party agents operate.\nBy consenting to the transfer of your personal data outside of your country of residence, you acknowledge that your personal information may be transferred to recipients in the United States and other countries that may not offer the same level of privacy protection as the laws in your country of residence or citizenship.<br>\n<br>EA's privacy practices comply with the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System.\nThe APEC CBPR system provides a framework for organizations to ensure protection of personal information transferred among participating APEC economies.\nMore information about the APEC framework is available on this page: https://www.apec.org/Groups/Committee-on-Trade-and-Investment/~/media/Files/Groups/ECSG/CBPR/CBPR-PoliciesRulesGuidelines.ashx.<br>\n<br>Electronic Arts Inc.\nholds certifications under the (former) EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield which are available at www.privacyshield.gov.\nWhen Electronic Arts Inc.\ntransfers information from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and

the legal regime of the countries to which data is being transferred and, as necessary, updates measures to ensure that we provide adequate levels of protection.\nTo learn more visit this page: https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBPRIVACYSHIELD/US/en/PC/.<br>\n<br>6.\nHow We Protect Your Information<br>\n<br>Security of your information is a priority at EA and we take a range of technical and organizational measures to help protect it, including encryption of sensitive information.\nEven so, please be aware that no security measure is 100% perfect.\nThus we cannot guarantee the security of your information at all times.\nYou should always be diligent when it comes to the protection of your personal information.<br>\n<br>7.\nChildren<br>\n<br>Although the majority of EA online and mobile games and Services are intended for adults, EA recognizes the importance of protecting children's privacy online.\nAs applicable, we strive to follow the different minimum age guidelines set by the laws of individual countries or territories when determining the age that children can access certain features of our Services.<br>\n<br>When players identify themselves as being children we will:<br>\n<br>(1) obtain consent from parents for the use of their children's personal information, when required by applicable law.\nFor example, we allow parents to create a child EA Account on certain Services, and with parental consent EA will collect and use certain children\u2019s personal information to manage a child EA Account;<br>\n<br>(2) disable features in certain Services that could allow a child to share information that directly identifies them, unless a parent has provided relevant consent to us or the third-party platform on which their child is playing.\nFor example, we will respect third-party (console) parental controls as they apply to game features that could allow a child to provide personal information (e.g., via free-form chat, audio communications, user generated content) in online or multiplayer games;<br>\n<br>(3) collect and use certain information for limited purposes only.\nFor example, we may send local in-app notifications, which do not rely on collecting personal information.\nAlso, persistent identifiers (e.g., IP address or mobile advertising device identifier) may be collected to support our internal operations, such as:<br>\n<br>- Delivering the Services;<br>- Maintaining or analyzing the functionality of the Service;<br>- Serving contextual ads or frequency capping;<br>- Protecting the security or integrity of the user of Service.\nor<br>- Legal or regulatory compliance.<br>\n<br>(4) not condition a child's participation in an activity (e.g., gaming contests) on the disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.\nWith certain Service-related activities, we may not permit children to participate at all, even if we have consent.<br>\n<br>Parental controls and choices:<br>\n<br>If you are a parent or guardian and wish to revoke your previously provided consent, review information collected from your child or have that information deleted, please contact us via the options in Section 11 below.\nIf we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will delete any personal information we have collected, unless we have a legal obligation to keep it, and terminate the child's account and/or revert them to the underage experience, as applicable.<br>\n<br>If we make material changes to how we collect, use, share or otherwise process your child's personal information, we will notify parents as required by applicable law.<br>\n<br>We encourage you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers and the risks of disclosing personal information online.\nYou and your child should review the privacy settings applicable to their use of our Services, a summary of which is available here (https://www.ea.com/commitments/positive-play/parental-controls), as well as our Online Safety web page (https://tos.ea.com/legalapp/OnlineSafety/US/en/PC/), for additional information about using the Internet safely.<br>\n<br>8.\nYour Choices and Controls<br>\n<br>We give you meaningful choices when it comes to our collection and use of your information.\nFor example, if you no longer wish to

EA games or Services associated with your account.\nNote that EA may retain information needed to resolve disputes, enforce our user agreements, protect our legal rights, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of our Services.\nOtherwise, we will retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to provide

while watching television images or playing certain video games.\nThis may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures.\nIf you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing.</p>\n<p>We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children.\nIf you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, discontinue use IMMEDIATELY and consult your doctor.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Precautions to Take During Use</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not stand too close to the screen.\nSit a good distance away from the screen, as far away as the length of the cable allows.</li>\n<li>Preferably play the game on a small

(for example a PlayStation Camera for PS VR).<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp;To make the most of your VR experience, take care to do the following before you play to limit the risk of injury or other adverse impacts on your health:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read any health and safety warnings in your VR headset manual.</li>\n<li>Make sure you have plenty of space to play, and remove any obstacles - this includes making sure that other people or pets don\u2019t interrupt your play as you may not be able to see or hear everything around you while playing.</li>\n<li>Sound volumes should be kept at a low enough level so that you can be aware of your surroundings while playing, and to avoid any&nbsp;&nbsp.\ndamage to your hearing.</li>\n<li>If you have experienced epileptic symptoms in the past, you should speak to your doctor before playing VR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When playing, please do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is best to stay seated.</li>\n<li>Take breaks from gameplay every 10 to 15 minutes.</li>\n<li>Users may experience motion sickness, repetitive motion injuries and eyestrain as the result of using VR.\nIf you feel disoriented or unwell or experience any other discomfort, stop playing VR immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional important health information from the main headset manufacturers is available below.\nPlease review the information carefully before playing your
