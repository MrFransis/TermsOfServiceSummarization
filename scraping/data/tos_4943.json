the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>\n<p>13.2.First \u2014 Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.\nIf any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, the Content, your User Submissions, or this Agreement (collectively, \u201cDispute\u201d), or to any of GigaOm\u2019s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an \u201cExcluded Dispute\u201d, which includes

proposed resolution of it.\nOur notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.\nBut if you have failed to provide us with this information or if such information is not current or accurate, then we have no obligation under this Section 13.2.\nYour notice to us must be sent to:</p>\n<p>GigaOm<br>\n3905 State Street #7-448<br>\nSanta Barbara, CA 93105-5107</p>\n<p>For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, GigaOm and you will engage in a good faith dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or GigaOm to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and GigaOm, in each party\u2019s sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>\n<p>13.3.Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Arbitration.If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 13.2 above within 60 days of receipt of the notice (or, where no notice address exists for you, after such Dispute arises), then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 13.3.\nIf we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 13.2 above within 60 days of receipt of the notice (or, where no notice address exists for you, after such Excluded Dispute arises), then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and GigaOm consent, in a writing signed by you and GigaOm\u2019s General Counsel, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.\nIn such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a \u201cDispute\u201d for the remainder of this Section 13.3.\n<p>Upon expiration of the applicable 60-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 10 years\u2019 experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.\nIf the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if GigaOm elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.\nThe arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.\nIf you and GigaOm do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 13.3.A, then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 13.3 will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.</p>\n<p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within 60 days of the filing of a \u201cdemand for arbitration,\u201d then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201d) using JAMS\u2019 streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and a legal officer of GigaOm consents to in writing.\nThe substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.</p>\n<p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p> AAA:\n800.778.7879\nJAMS:\n949.224.1810 http://www.adr.org/ http://www.jamsadr.com </li>\n<li>Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.\nIn arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys\u2019 fees).\nHowever, WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.\nAll parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.\nIf an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in Austin, Texas.\nbut if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the \u201cmetropolitan statistical area\u201d (as defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, GigaOm shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location.\nYou

will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.\nJudgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>13.4.Limited Time to File Claims.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE

FEASIBLE) WITHIN 1 YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES \u2014 OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>\n<p>13.5.Injunctive Relief.\nThe foregoing provisions of this Section 13 will not apply to any legal action

in small claims court.</p>\n<p>13.7.No Class Action Matters.\nDisputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 13.3.A above holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 13.3 above to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 13.8 below.</p>\n<p>13.8.Federal and State Courts in Austin.\nExcept to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 13.3 above, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Austin, Texas.\nAccordingly, you and GigaOm consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</p>\n<p>13.9.Applicable Law.\nThis Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>\n14.\nConstruction\n<p>If any portion of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that portion shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and
