under this agreement, that inability will not constitute a breach if (1) that party uses reasonable efforts to perform those obligations, (2) that party\u2019s inability to perform those obligations is not due to its failure to (A) take reasonable measures to protect itself against events or circumstances of the same type as that force majeure event or (B) develop and keep a reasonable contingency plan to respond to events or circumstances of the same type as that force majeure event, and (3) that party complies with its obligations under section

consequences of that event or circumstance.</p>\n<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf a force majeure event occurs, the noncomplying party will promptly notify the other party of occurrence of that force majeure event, its effect on performance, and how long the noncomplying party expects it to last.\nFrom then on, the noncomplying party will update that information as reasonably necessary.\nDuring a force majeure event, the noncomplying party will use reasonable efforts to limit damages to the other party and to

<p>\n<strong>Marketing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising.\nWe have established the following personal data control mechanisms:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Promotional offers from us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you.\nThis is how we decide which products, services, and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>\n<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party marketing</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Opting out</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences, by following the opt-out links on any marketing messages sent to you, or by contacting us at any time.</p>\n<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product or service purchase, product or service experience, or other transactions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.\nIf you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly.\nFor more information about the cookies we use, please see our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Change of purpose</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.\nIf you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us.</p>\n<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>\n<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nDisclosures of your personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes stated in the table (<em>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</em>) above.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.</li>\n<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.\nAlternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them.\nIf a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.\nWe do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nInternational transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are based in Canada but our servers are located in the United States.\nWe may process, store, and transfer the personal data we collect, in and to a country outside your own, with different privacy laws that may or may not be as comprehensive as your own.\nWhere we do so, and where we are required to under local law, we will put in place appropriate mechanisms to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection where it is processed.</p>\n<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>), your personal data may be processed outside of the EEA, including, for example, in Canada and the United States, so processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.\nFor further details, see <em>European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</em>.</li>\n<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.\nFor further details, see <em>European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</em>.</li>\n<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.\nFor further details, see <em>European Commission: EU\u2013US Privacy Shield</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nData security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed.\nIn addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties who have a business need to know.\nThey will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>\n<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nData retention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or reporting requirements.\nWe may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.</p>\n<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements.</p>\n<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial, and Transaction Data) for seven years after they stop being customers for tax purposes.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <em>accessing and correcting your personal data</em> and <em>your EEA legal rights</em> below for further information.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances we will anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nAccessing and correcting your personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can access, review, and change your personal data by logging in the website and visiting your account settings page.</p>\n<p>You may also send us an email at privacy@juicyads.com to request access to, correct, or delete any personal data that you have provided to us.\nWe cannot delete your personal data except by also deleting your user account.\nWe may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or negatively affect the information\u2019s accuracy.</p>\n<p>If you delete your user contributions from the website, copies of your user contributions may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or might have been copied or stored by other website users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nDo Not Track policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Do Not Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser.\nDNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nWe are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt out.\nBut we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.\nFor more information, visit www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nYour California privacy rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal data.\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the \u201cShine The Light\u201d law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the name and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal data in the immediately preceding calendar year.\nIf you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nYour Canadian privacy rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We comply with Canadian Federal and Provincial privacy laws and regulations, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.</p>\n<p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes intended and as detailed in this policy unless we have obtained your consent to use it for other purposes.</p>\n<p>Residents of Canada are notified that the personal data they provide to us is stored in our databases outside of Canada, including in the United States, and may be subject to disclosure to authorized law enforcement or government agencies in response to lawful demand under the laws of that country.</p>\n<p>You may withdraw your consent to our personal data collection, use, or disclosure, subject to legal and contractual restrictions.</p>\n<p>You have the right to complain about our personal data handling practices.</p>\n<p>If you need to contact us about your personal data or believe that we have violated your privacy rights, please contact us using the contact details provided above.\nYou may visit www.priv.gc.ca for more information about your privacy rights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nYour EEA legal rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you reside in the EEA, under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.\nPlease click on the links below to find out more about these rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Request access to your personal data</em>.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Request correction of your personal data</em>.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Request erasure of your personal data</em>.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Object to processing of your personal data</em>.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Request restriction of processing your personal data</em>.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Request transfer of your personal data</em>.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Right to withdraw consent</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No fee usually required</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).\nHowever, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.\nAlternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What we may need from you</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).\nThis is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Time limit to respond</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.\nGlossary</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lawful Basis</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legitimate Interest </strong>means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience.\nWe make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.\nWe do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).\nYou can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Comply with a legal obligation </strong>means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>External Third Parties</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Compliance with Laws.\n</strong>We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so to comply with applicable law, government requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vital Interests and Legal Rights.\n</strong>We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.\n</strong>We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to that information to do that work.\nExamples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing efforts.\nWe may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the website, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the website over time.\nThis information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity.\nFor example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the website (you can read more about how Google uses your personal data here: https://www.google.com/int\u2019l/en/policies/privacy/).\nYou can also optout of Google Analytics here: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\nWe also use AddThis to collect information from visitors of our website.\nYou can easily opt out of interest-based advertising facilitated by AddThis at any time using the AddThis opt out.\nYou can also opt out at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/, and

Rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a \u201cdata subject access request\u201d).\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.\nNote, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.\nYou also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nIn some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you want us to establish the data\u2019s accuracy.</li>\n<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>\n<li>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>\n<li>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party.\nWe will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.\nNote that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data.\nHowever, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.\nIf you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.\nWe will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p> ", "created_at": "2022-01-08 18:25:03.338534", "updated_at": "2022-01-08 17:25:51.560918"}, {"id":
