hereof is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected thereby and the remaining provisions will continue with the\nsame effect as if

thereby been impaired.\nIt is expressly\nunderstood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement\non any other occasion.\nNothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.\nIn the event that either party is prevented\nfrom performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party\u2019s performance will be extended for the period of delay\nor inability to perform due to such occurrence.\nThe headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of this Agreement but are for convenience only.\nYou and

T&amp;Cs.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Sponsor and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an e-mail to our customer support team at support@gopuff.com within thirty (30) days of the earlier of (i) the day\nyou first access or use the Site or the App and (ii) the day you first earn Puff Points under the Program.</p>\n<p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.\nHOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES)\nAND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THESE T&amp;CS AS A COURT WOULD.</p>\n<p>If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Sponsor\u2019s Customer Service Center of your intent to arbitrate (\u201c<u>Notice</u>\u201d).\nThe Notice to Sponsor should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic\nmail to support@gopuff.com or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S.\nPostal Service certified mail to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centreville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808.\nThe Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis\nof the claim or dispute and (y) set forth the specific relief sought.\nIf we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the notice is received, you or Sponsor may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nThe arbitration will\nbe conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<u>AAA</u>\u201d) under its rules, as modified by this Agreement, including the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes.\nThe AAA\u2019s rules are available at www.adr.org\nor by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nThe number of arbitrators shall be one.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these T&amp;Cs.\nPayment of all filing, administration\nand arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules.\nWe will reimburse all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim\nor the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Sponsor\nfor all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nSponsor will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the relief sought is improper or\nnot warranted.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language.\nJudgment\non the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability,\nunconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.\nHowever, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the paragraph\nbelow.</p>\n<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nFurther, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person\u2019s\nclaims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.\nIf for any reason a claim\nproceeds in court rather than in arbitration we EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court for injunctive relief, including to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>LIMITATION
