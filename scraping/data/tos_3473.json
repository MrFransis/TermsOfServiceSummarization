Policyadmin2017-06-23T17:58:40+00:00 Fresh Produce Association of the Americas\n<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their \u2018Personally

links\n<p>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.</p>\nGoogle\n<p>Google\u2019s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google\u2019s Advertising Principles.\nThey are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.\nhttps://support.google.com/adwordspolicy</p>\nWe use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.\n<p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site.\nGoogle\u2019s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites on the

privacy policy.\nThe law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.\n\u2013 See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa</p>\nAccording to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:\n<p>Users can visit our site

when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>\nDoes our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)\n<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, United States\u2019 consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children\u2019s privacy and safety online.</p>\nWe do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.\nFair Information Practices\n<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.\nUnderstanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>\n<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify you via email within 7 business days.</p>\n<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.\nThis principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>\nCAN SPAM Act\n<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>\nWe collect your email address in order to:\n<ul>\n<li>Send information, respond to inquiries,
