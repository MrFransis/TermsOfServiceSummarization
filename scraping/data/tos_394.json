Inc.\n(\u201cJobvite,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) collect, use and share personal data of visitors to our web site&nbsp;</em>\n<em>www.jobvite.com</em>\n<em>&nbsp;(the \u201cSite\u201d) and users of our on-demand recruitment application (the \u201cServices\u201d).\nBy visiting and using the Site and Services, you are deemed to have agreed to the provisions of this Privacy Notice, unless you are in the EEA or Switzerland in which case you are acknowledging that you have been provided this Privacy Notice.\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Your privacy is very important to us and we are committed to protecting it.\nNot only do we abide by applicable laws and regulations and follow industry best practices for data security and privacy, we also never sell or share personal data except as described in this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>For purposes of the Privacy Notice, \u2018personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nan identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>\n<p>Please note that neither this Privacy Notice nor the consent described applies to your interactions with our customers.\nJobvite provides a platform that enables our customers to manage data that they collect and obtain consent subject to their own privacy policies.\nFor information on how our customers handle the personal data you provide via their career web sites or the use of our services in conjunction with theirs, please consult their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>If you are located in the European Union, or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.\nlaw, then please note that you are transferring information and permitting the transfer of information, including personal data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S.\nand the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal data, as described in this Privacy Notice.\nJobvite complies with the Principles of the Privacy Shield Framework (see below).</p>\n<p>In the context of this Privacy Notice and particularly with respect to non-US privacy rules, Jobvite is typically handling a user\u2019s personal data at the direction of the user or one of our customers.\nThat means that we are collecting, storing, and managing each user\u2019s personal data in our role as a service provider and don\u2019t have discretion around the purposes for processing.\nThis applies to the vast majority of the personal data we hold, whether you are an individual who submits an application to a particular job or you are an employee in a recruiting position or an external recruiter.\nAs a result of this, the rules or promises about how that data will be used, shared, and such arise from that customer organization\u2019s privacy notice, or at the user\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p>There are times, though, when we at Jobvite process data as a function of how we evolve our service delivery model.\nThat means that we are collecting and using personal data not under the instruction of a customer, but rather for our own legitimate purposes - one of which is acting under the instruction of the user (i.e.\na data subject).\nThis Privacy Notice applies when we are acting in this capacity, which arises when you are visiting our Site or using our Services in a context other than applying for a singularly specific role.\nFor example, if you have been directed to our Site to apply for a specific opportunity after you submit your application (for which we act as a data processor) we will send you an email to enable you to complete your profile.\nAnother example would be where you are attempting to apply for an opportunity with an employer using data you have already submitted to a different employer.\nIn this context, you are submitting personal data but not in the context of a single specific application.</p>\n<strong>Information We Collect and How We Use It</strong>\n<p>You can generally visit the Site without revealing any directly identifiable personal data about yourself.\nWe do not collect personal data from our Site visitors without the Site visitor providing us with this information as set forth in this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>If you request to receive company or product information or request an online demonstration of the Services, you will be asked to complete the online demo request form on our Site that asks for your name, title, e-mail address, company name, state or province, country and phone number.\nWe request this information so that we can most effectively direct your request to the proper member on our team.\nYou can also voluntarily provide comments to Jobvite when submitting the request form.\nWe use the information from the request form to deliver the requested information and/or provide you with the online demonstration of the Services.</p>\n<p>In order to become a registered user of the Services, Jobvite requires you to create a user account.\nTo register for a user account, you must provide the following personal data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are an employer, you must provide your company\u2019s name and e-mail address of a contact at your company</li>\n<li>If you are an employee of an employer, you must provide your name, e-mail address, country and zip code</li>\n<li>If you are a jobseeker, you must provide your name, e-mail address, country, zip code and password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Providing any additional information beyond what is required at registration is optional.</em>\n</p>\n<strong> How We Secure Your Personal Data </strong>\n<p>We take commercially reasonable efforts to maintain security protections in accordance with industry best practices to protect data we collect from loss, alteration, destruction, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>\n<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of the personal data we collect, we have implemented physical, electronic, and administrative procedures.\nWe utilize hashing, encryption, and de-identification techniques to help ensure your personal data is safeguarded.</p>\n<p>We have policies to help maintain control and physical security of the facilities used to store data and only allow access to authorized personnel, restrict access to data to only those employees, contractors and agents that require it to provide and support our services.\nAll our employees are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to disciplinary or legal action if they fail to meet these responsibilities.</p>\n<p>We process information in a way that is compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was collected.\nTo the extent necessary for those purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in our care is accurate, complete, current, and reliable for its intended use.\nFor example, when you create a profile and submit information about your education, skills, and past positions, we process that personal data in response to your request that we do so.\nLikewise, if you subsequently want to use profile information to apply for a specific opportunity, we will share that information in response to your request.\nThat is how we fulfill our agreement with you.</p>\n<strong>Aggregate Information</strong>\n<p>Jobvite may also automatically collect and analyze information about your general usage of the Site and Services.\nWhen you perform certain actions using the Services, Jobvite may track your usage patterns to see what features of the Site and Services you commonly use, Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser, browser language, IP address and operating system, and statistical information about types of jobs offered and qualifications of jobseekers submitting their resumes.\nJobvite will collect, track and analyze such information in an aggregate manner that does not personally identify you.\nThis aggregate data may be used by Jobvite and third party vendors to assist Jobvite in operating the Site and the Services and provided to other third parties to enable them to better understand the operation of Jobvites\u2019 business, but such information will be in aggregate form only and will not contain personally identifiable data.\nJobvite may also gather information about you (that you voluntarily submit to Jobvite) when you log-in to the Services, provide feedback to Jobvite and/or send or receive communications regarding the Services.</p>\n<p>Jobvite may use your personal data to register you to use the Services and provide you with the Services.\nverify your authority to enter the Site and access the Services.\nnotify you of Services updates.\nimprove the content and general administration of the Site and the Services.\nprovide you with notices regarding the Services and other services that you have purchased or may wish to purchase in the future.\nand to send you targeted advertising.\nJobvite does not provide e-mail addresses to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>When you send messages through the Services, your name and e-mail address will be identified in the message and the addressee may view your name and e-mail address.\nAny messages addressed to you through the Services can be sent to your personal e-mail address or to your Jobvite account inbox by setting your preferences on the \u201cMy settings\u201d page.</p>\n<p>If you elect to use our Site or the Services to contact a jobseeker or potential employer, Jobvite will generate an automatic e-mail that is sent to the jobseeker or potential employer, as applicable, inviting the jobseeker or potential employer to visit the Site.\nIf the targeted recipient does not respond to the e-mail, Jobvite will not send any reminder e-mails or use this contact information for any other purpose.</p>\n<strong>Invitations and Communications to Non-Registered Users</strong>\n<p>Users of the Services and visitors to the career sites of our customers may forward job postings to third parties who are not registered users of the Site or the Services as an invitation to learn more about a job opportunity in accordance with the applicable terms set forth in the Jobvite Terms of Use posted to the Site at&nbsp;www.jobvite.com/terms-of-use.\nJobvite does not store the information that a posting or invitation has gone to a third party unless and until that third party responds to the invitation.\nIf the third party responds to the invitation, the third party is treated like any other job-seeker, and the information Jobvite collects is treated in accordance with this Privacy Notice.\nin addition, Jobvite will note at that time who invited the referral so that Jobvite customers are aware of the source of the referral and may use that information to reward the referring person.</p>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<p>This Site is not intended for children under the age of 16 and we endeavor not to collect any personal data from children under the age of 16.\nJobvite targets its Services and this Site to adults and not to children under 16.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected personal on the Site from a child under age 16, we will delete that information promptly.\nIf you believe that we might have any information from a child under 16, please contact us at privacy@jobvite.com*protected email*.</p>\n<strong>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</strong>\n<p>We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Notice.&nbsp.\nWe do not sell your personal data to third parties.</p>\n<strong>Service Provider, Sub-Processors/Onward Transfer</strong>\n<p>Jobvite may transfer Personal data to companies that help us provide our service.\nTransfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Notice regarding notice, choice, and the subscription agreements with our subscribers.</p>\n<strong>Information Related to Data Collected through Jobvite Services</strong>\n<p>Jobvite engages vendors and service agencies to assist us in providing the Services to you, and Jobvite will need to share your personal data (and data generated by cookies and beacons) with these vendors and service agencies.&nbsp;We may transfer personal data to these vendors and service agencies that help us provide our service.\nAlthough transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers, Jobvite is potentially liable for onward transfers to third parties of personal data of EU individuals received pursuant to Privacy Shield.\u201d&nbsp;<em>These vendors and service agencies do not receive any right to use your personal data beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you.</em>&nbsp;Except as provided in this Privacy Notice, Jobvite will not disclose personal data to third parties, including, but not limited to, companies affiliated with Jobvite, without your consent.\n</p>\n<strong>Information Disclosure for Legal and Other Exceptional Reasons</strong>\n<p>We may also disclose your personal data: (a) if we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an investigation of a governmental authority and in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, (b) to enforce the Jobvite Terms of Use or Master Subscription Agreement or (c) to protect our rights and the safety of users of our Site and our Services.\nIn addition, we may transfer your personal data to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which Jobvite participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Jobvite\u2019s assets to which this Site relates.\nYou will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal data.</p>\n<strong>Data Retention</strong>\n<p>Jobvite retains personal data as a data controller and the personal data we process on

comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements with customers, and/or the period required by laws in applicable jurisdictions.</p>\n<strong>Updating, Correcting and Deleting Data Controlled by Our Customers</strong>\n<p>Jobvite has no direct relationship with the individual employees and job-seekers whose personal data it processes on our behalf of our customers.\nIndividuals applying for jobs with employers that are Jobvite customers have an account set up under their email address that associates all applications for that individual with that email address.\nThe individual can access their account at the Site and transmit requests to the employers to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data in an application.\nThe employer is responsible for complying with the individual\u2019s request.\n<strong>If you are an employee or job-seeker and would no longer like to be contacted by a particular employer or employers, please contact them

Jobvite newsletters and other information in response to your request.</p>\n<p>When we collect information about you through a job opportunity, the legal basis on which we process your personal data is the performance of our agreement with you and our recruiting customer.\nWhen we use your personal data outside of what is strictly necessary for an application or maintaining your profile on
