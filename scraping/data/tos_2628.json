<ul>\n<li>Companies within the group of companies owned directly or indirectly by Ocado Group Plc (as data processors), which provide services which support the Ocado Retail business including general merchandise operation services, fulfilment operations, customer operations, finance and audit, customer service, IT, human resources, legal and similar business support services.\nPlease note that Ocado Group Plc and the companies it owns are different companies to Ocado Retail companies (which are defined in the 'Who we are' section above).</li>\n<li>Companies that analyse Customer information to help us better understand how you use our services, or to tailor products, services and offers that may be relevant for you.\n</li>\n<li>Companies that provide Marketing assistance (including management of email Marketing operations, mobile messaging services such as SMS, and services that deploy Marketing on the internet or social media platforms, such as Facebook and Google), as well as analysis of the effectiveness of our Marketing campaigns.</li>\n<li>Payment card processors that process credit and debit card payments.</li>\n<li>External companies that provide post, courier or other delivery services.</li>\n<li>General service companies such as printers and mailing houses that distribute direct mail Marketing.</li>\n<li>Companies that help us track and record the way you

run surveys and get your feedback on our products and services.\n</li>\n<li>Companies that help us provide our websites and apps and improve their functionality so that we can provide you with a high-quality experience whenever you shop with us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Specially selected partners who provide promotional communications -</strong> Sometimes we send communications (including offers) on behalf of, or in partnership with, specially selected partners when we have identified offers that we believe will be of interest to you.\nThese specially selected partners will generally be other retailers (such as online clothing companies) but could include additional types of third party providers of consumer products and services from time to time.\n<u>We will only do this if you have previously agreed to receive these Marketing communications.</u> We will not permit other businesses to contact you separately, and all such promotional communications will come via us.\nWe do not share any personal information with these partners for their independent Marketing purposes, but we may share aggregate statistics, such as the number of people that opened an email containing a promotion.\nIf you wish to withdraw your consent from receiving these communications you can do so at any time by logging in to your relevant online account and amending your Marketing Preferences page.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>New business owners -</strong> If any Ocado Retail company is ever sold or its assets are purchased by another company it would typically be part of such a transaction for customer information to form part of the business assets being transferred.\nHowever, the information will remain subject to the obligations as outlined in this Privacy &amp.\nCookie Policy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Research companies -</strong> We may share personal information in a secure way to allow research companies and feedback providers to contact you directly on our behalf, in order to capture your opinions on our products and services, our websites and apps.\n<u>The choice to partake in our market research or surveys will always be yours.</u> We may ask these research companies to analyse the results so that we can better understand your online experience, which will help us to improve our services.\nWe provide them with only the information they need to perform their function.\nThis may take the form of a survey, where you may be asked to review a product or service you've bought.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Public agencies -</strong> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, to enforce our Terms &amp.\nConditions and other agreements for each Ocado Retail company, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Ocado Retail, our employees or Customers, our business partners, or others.\nIn these instances, we provide them with only the information they need to perform their function.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fraud prevention bodies -</strong> Where we have good reason to suspect fraud or any other criminal offence, we are legally obliged to share your data (such as your name, household information, details of failed payments and your orders placed with us) with crime prevention agencies and certain third parties for the purpose of detecting and preventing crime.\nSuch third parties may include business partners, law enforcement bodies, providers of fraud prevention and detection services, and recipients of fraud prevention and detection services.\nIf we think there is a risk of fraud, we may suspend activity on your account, refuse access to your account, and/or cancel an order.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third parties with which we link Customer accounts -</strong> we may allow you to use your Ocado Retail login credentials on certain third party websites in order to access their services, including Dobbies Garden Centres and Fabled.\nThese companies are other retailers who, along with us, use technology provided by the group of companies owned by Ocado Group Plc to power their online accounts and (where applicable) provide fulfilment services.\nPlease note that because these accounts are linked, if you wish to close one account, this will result in all of your linked accounts being closed.\nAlternatively, your accounts can remain active and you can request to be removed from any relevant third party marketing communications.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facebook -</strong> Ocado Retail may share customers' personal data (mobile numbers and email addresses) with Facebook Ireland for the purposes of: <ul>\n<li>Identifying customers who use Facebook so we can advertise products we think would be of interest to them based on their Facebook profile.</li>\n<li>Serving non Ocado Retail customers targeted marketing about our products and services on Facebook.\nThis is done if we think that they are likely to be interested in our goods and services based on whether their profile matches those of our Customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ocado Retail and Facebook Ireland are Joint Data Controllers for this processing and both parties have entered into a written agreement that sets out their respective responsibilities for carrying out the processing in a GDPR compliant manner.\nThis includes a requirement for Ocado Retail to provide our customers with details of the processing we carry out (as detailed above) and an acknowledgment that Facebook Ireland will be responsible for enabling Data Subjects' GDR rights for any Personal Data it stores after the Joint Processing.</p>\n<p>For further information about how Facebook Ireland processes your personal data, including the legal basis they rely on and the ways you can exercise your rights over the data they hold about you please visit https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> Security, data retention and international data transfers <p>We know how important it is to protect and manage your personal information.\nThis section sets out some of the measures we have in place.\nWe take the security of your personal information seriously and employ technical and organisational measures to protect the integrity and privacy of your personal information.\nWe only retain your personal information for clearly established periods.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our security measures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our websites use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect the transfer of your information to and from our website.\nOur web page URLs will start with https and a padlock will be displayed in front of the URL bar to show that we always encrypt the information that you send us.\n</p>\n<p>We maintain and enforce physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information.\nHowever, whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of all personal information that you transfer over the internet to us in every circumstance, for example, if we suffer a sophisticated cyber-attack.\n</p>\n<p>Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you, including in relation to a request by you for the data we hold on you (a subject access request).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Keeping your payment details secure</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are committed to ensuring the protection of your payment card details and are compliant with the Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).\nPayments made via our sites are processed and managed by specialist payment card companies which are not part of Ocado Retail.\nWe only store and display the first six and last four digits of your payment card number, the card type and the card expiry date.\nThe full payment card number is never stored on any of our systems and is only stored and processed by a payment card processing company approved by us.</p>\n<p>We keep an encrypted authentication token to represent your card and this token is transmitted to the relevant payment card processing company during the order processing.\n</p>\n<p>We use 3D Secure to provide additional fraud protection and to protect your payment card from unauthorised use.\nDuring the checkout process, you may be asked by 3D Secure to provide your Verified by Visa or Mastercard Secure Code password.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Protecting your password </strong>\n</p>\n<p>It is important to keep your password secure to prevent fraudulent use of your account.\nNever disclose your password to anyone else, and especially to anyone who requests it from you by telephone or email.\nwe'll never do this (more information below).\nYou should avoid using the same password for other websites, because if their systems are hacked, the hackers will also be able to access your account.\n</p>\n<p>Avoid using common terms for your password such as \"password\" or \"123456\".\nhackers know the most popular passwords and will try to access accounts using these.\nInstead, try to use a combination of letters and numbers that means something to you so it's easy to remember but difficult to guess.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal security and identity fraud </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Using public WiFi networks can be risky, and hackers may try to capture your online transactions and personal information.\nYou should only connect to networks that you trust.\nIf you use a shared computer, make sure that you log out once you have finished using the website.\n</p>\n<p>Criminals and fraudsters may attempt to steal your personal information using a technique known as 'phishing'.\nThis is where criminals send bogus emails that appear to be from Ocado Retail but are actually fake.\nThese emails often deceive people into giving away their personal information(such as usernames and passwords) under the guise of updating security details, and contain a link to false websites asking you to input your account details.</p>\n<p>We will never ask you to provide your personal information via email.\nIf you receive an email like this that claims to be from us and contains a link to an external website, or a request for you to enter any personal information, treat it as suspicious and do not enter any personal information, even if the page appears legitimate.\nIf you suspect that your account details are subject to such fraudulent activities, please let us know by calling our Contact Centre.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retaining your personal information </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>General principles</u>\n</p>\n<p>In general, we retain your personal information for no longer than necessary in order to fulfil the purposes described above.</p>\n<p>In addition, after you have ceased to be a Customer, we may take steps to delete your personal information or hold it in a form which no longer identifies you (for example, we may still use your data in an anonymised format for research and other business purposes).</p>\n<p>\n<u>Specific retention periods</u>\n</p>\n<p>We keep your personal information for as long as you are a Customer of Ocado Retail (which includes ocado.com, ocadozoom.com and fetch.co.uk) and for a period of time afterwards if you stop doing so.\nBelow are the time periods for which we retain Customer information: </p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customers that have registered but never shopped -</strong> We keep your personal information for eight years after the date of first registration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customers that have not shopped for an extended period of time -</strong> We keep your personal information for seven years after the date of your last shop.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customers who have asked for their accounts to be closed -</strong> We keep your personal information for seven years after the date your account was closed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Call recordings -</strong> We delete call recordings after three months unless we need the data to investigate fraud, to respond to questions or complaints or for legal reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Customer account notes -</strong> We delete notes made on your account by our Contact Centre advisors after two years, unless we need the data to investigate fraud, to respond to questions and complaints, or for legal reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Closing your Ocado Retail account(s)</u>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that all of your Ocado Retail accounts are linked, so if you wish to close one account, this will result in all of your Ocado Retail accounts being closed.\nAlternatively, your accounts can remain active and we can ensure that you are removed from all relevant third party marketing communications from any given account.\nFor further information, please contact our Contact Centre.\n</p>\n<p>Sending information outside the European Economic Area</p>\n<p>Our operations are based in the UK and the personal information that we collect from you is mainly processed, stored, and used within the UK and other countries in the European Economic Area (EEA).\nOccasionally, we also work with service providers from other parts of the world in order to offer you the best service we can provide.\nThis means that the data we collect sometimes needs to be transferred, stored, and used by companies operating outside the EEA who work for us or one of our service providers.\nWe have taken steps to ensure there is an appropriate level of security for the processing carried out in these countries, such that data is protected in the same way as if it was being used within the EEA.\n</p>\n<p>This includes using one of the following safeguards: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses in contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries.</li>\n<li>Transfers to organisations that are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield.\nThis is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries.\nIt makes sure those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA.</li>\n<li>Transfers to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find out more about the above data protection safeguards on the European Commission Justice website.\n</p>\n<p>For more information on how we safeguard transfers of your personal information, please contact us at privacy@ocadoretail.com.\n</p> Your choices and rights <p>This section explains how you can exercise your individual rights in relation to your personal information, including the choices you have when it comes to receiving Marketing communications.\n</p>\n<p>You have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you, including the right to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to your personal information.</li>\n<li> Request the deletion of your personal information.\n</li>\n<li> Request that we restrict our use of your personal information.\n</li>\n<li> Receive personal information which you have provided to use in a structured, commonly-used and machine-readable format (e.g.\na CSV file).\n</li>\n<li> Object to our use of your personal information.\n</li>\n<li> Withdraw your consent to our processing of your personal information.\n</li>\n<li> Complain to a supervisory authority.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain rights may be limited in some circumstances.\nFor further information about your rights, please see the ICO's website.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Requesting access to your personal information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to access a copy of the personal information we hold about you.\nYou have the right to request that this information is provided in a machine readable format in the event that you wish it to be transferred to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What if you want us to stop using your personal information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can object to certain processing activities which use your personal information, in particular where the processing is based on our legitimate interests, as outlined in the section entitled 'How we use your personal information'.\nYou can ask us to delete, remove, or stop using your personal information if there is no need for us to keep it.\nYou can also ask us to restrict the use of your personal information in certain circumstances.\nThese rights are known as the 'right to erasure' and the 'right to restrict processing' under data protection law.\nWe'll keep a note of your name if you ask for your personal information to be erased.\nYou'll also need to use a different email address if you decide to re-register as a Customer with us as your old email address will no longer be valid.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>There may be reasons why the above rights may be limited in some circumstances.\nFor example, we can refuse to provide information if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required to retain by law, have compelling legitimate interests to keep, or need to access in order to fulfil our legal obligations.\nIn such situations, we would only use your information for these purposes and not use or share your information in other ways.\nWe will always protect your privacy and retain any personal information in accordance with the 'Data retention' section of this Privacy &amp.\nCookie Policy.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may be unable to continue using our services if you require us to stop using your personal information, since this information is necessary for us to accurately fulfil and provide our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to withdraw your consent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may withdraw consent at any time where we have asked for it, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.\nIf you would like to see what consent preferences we hold for you, we suggest that you first visit your Marketing Preferences page on the relevant Ocado Retail website (ocado.com, ocadozoom.com or fetch.co.uk).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Unsubscribing from our Marketing communications</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can ask us to stop sending you Marketing communications by contacting us at any time.\nYou may limit the types of Marketing you receive, or you can opt out of receiving our Marketing communications.\nYou can opt out of Marketing when you first open your account and also at any time after that simply by doing any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the Marketing Preferences page on the relevant Ocado Retail website (ocado.com, ocadozoom.com or

any postal or other form of Marketing we may send you (such as electronic Marketing).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you decide to opt out or unsubscribe from Marketing communications it could take up to 72 hours to process the update through our systems.\nWhatever you choose, you will still receive non-Marketing related messages and other important service information.\nYou can always unsubscribe from these

PURCHASE CONTRACT <p> 1.1 This website is operated by Ocado Retail Limited (\"we\", \"us\" or \"our\").\nBy using the Ocado.com website you are bound by these Terms &amp.\nConditions.\nAll use and purchases made on this website are governed by these Terms &amp.\nConditions at any time although the Terms &amp.\nConditions governing any given use or purchase will be those in effect at the date of your order or specific use.\nIf you use or order goods after we have published any changes you will be bound by those changes.\nAccordingly, you should check prior to each use or order to ensure that you understand the precise Terms &amp.\nConditions applicable to your site visit or purchase.\nTo assist you in determining whether the Terms &amp.\nConditions have changed since your most recent order we will display the date when these Terms &amp.\nConditions were most recently updated.\n</p>\n<p> 1.2 We sell goods only to end-users.\n</p>\n<p> 1.3 We will confirm your order whether placed directly by using the ocado.com website or as a result of you registering for Ocado Reserved (our automated order subscription service) and an automated order being generated.\nThis will occur either by message on the website immediately after you have confirmed your order, or by us sending an e-mail to the e-mail address you have provided to us (the latter of which will apply if you have registered for Ocado Reserved).\nExcept if you have registered with Ocado Reserved we may do both.\n</p>\n<p> 1.4 Please note that the order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of your order.\nSubject to our cancellation rights in clause 11, acceptance of your order and completion of the contract will take place when we despatch the goods to you.\n</p>\n<p> 1.5 If you have registered for the Ocado Reserved service (our automated order subscription service) or have placed an order for delivery two or more days in advance then we will endeavour also to send you an email a few hours before the final cut-off time for amending the order, alerting you to this cut-off time and reminding you of the scheduled delivery time of your order.\nThe purpose of the reminder is to reduce the likelihood of delivery times being forgotten and/or orders being left incomplete, and is part of our order confirmation process.\nUnless you have requested not to be contacted by text message, we may also send the reminder by text message to the mobile phone number you have given us when setting up your account.\n</p>\n<p> 1.6 After confirmation of the order, any items added via the \"One-Click Additions\" system before the cut-off time will automatically form part of that order.\n</p>\n<p> 1.7 Any orders placed through the Ocado Reserved service may be amended or cancelled by the customer at no charge, provided that this is done before the cut-off time stated on the order confirmation email or if none, as set out in clause 6 below.\nAny orders that have not been cancelled by this cut-off time are binding, and will be delivered by Ocado as set out in clause 1.3.\n</p>\n<p> 1.8 Ocado Reserved is a free service, and may be cancelled at any time by following the process set out in the detailed Terms &amp.\nConditions for Ocado Reserved.\n</p>\n<p> 1.9 You must be 18 years old or over and must have completed the registration process in order to participate in our service.\n</p>\n<p> 1.10 The law places certain restrictions on transactions involving alcohol, and accordingly alcohol must be either ordered by you or delivered by us during normal licensing hours.\nIf you have ordered alcohol from us and cannot be at home at your selected delivery time, it is your responsibility to ensure that a suitable person is there to receive the order.\nWe operate a Challenge 25 policy, which means that if the person receiving delivery of alcohol looks under 25, we will request identification.\nWe may also request identification in relation to other age restricted products such as knives and DVDs.\nWe may retain the products if proof of age or an alternative adult is not available.\n</p>\n<p> Back to top </p> 2 PRICE AND DELIVERY AND PLASTIC BAG CHARGES <p> 2.1a With the exception of goods referred to in clauses 2.1(b) and 2.1(c), but including goods from our butcher and fishmonger that are sold and priced by each (i.e.\na fixed price per item) and packaged by us (as further identified on the website), the price of such goods will be as quoted on the website at the time you confirm your order (usually by clicking the \"checkout\" button) subject only to any inadvertent technical error for which we will not be liable.\nIf you subsequently amend your order to add items, the prices charged for new products which were not in your original order will be the prices quoted at the time you confirm your amended order.\nHowever, if you add more of the same items which were in your original order, then the prices charged for these items will be the prices quoted at the time you confirmed your original order.\nWhere a substitute item is offered in place of an item ordered, the price charged for that substitute item (if accepted) will be the price applicable at the time the item is substituted.\nPlease note that as promotions are offered for a limited period of time subsequent amendments to your order may mean that certain promotions are no longer being offered.\n</p>\n<p> 2.1b Where items are ordered and sold individually by weight (such as certain fresh meat, poultry, fish, cheese or fruit and vegetables, but excluding goods from our Butcher and Fishmonger (see below) the price of these items (expressed per kilogram or other appropriate unit of measurement) will be the price on the date that they are weighed by our supplier.\nAlthough we have an indicative price/kg guide and an indicative product weight guide on the website, this is merely to assist your planning and the price you will be charged is the price prevailing on the date of weighing for the actual weight you receive.\nIn the event that there is a discrepancy between the price/kg on our website at time your order is made and the price/kg at the time the item is weighed by our supplier, the price you will be charged will be the price at the time the item is weighed by our supplier.\nAs used in this paragraph, goods from our Butcher and Fishmonger are goods that are individually packaged by us rather than by our suppliers, and either sold and priced individually by weight or sold and priced by item (as further identified on the website).\n</p>\n<p> 2.1c For goods from our Butcher and Fishmonger (as further identified on the website), the price of these items (expressed per kilogram or other appropriate unit of measurement) will be the price as quoted on the website at the time you confirm your order (usually by clicking the \"checkout\" button) subject only to any inadvertent technical error for which we will not be liable.\nIf you subsequently amend your order to add items, the prices charged will be those applicable to the new item(s) at the time that the amended order is confirmed.\nAlthough we have an indicative weight guide on the website, this is merely to assist your planning and the price you will be charged is the price for the actual weight you receive.\nIn the event that there is a change in the price/kg between the time you confirmed your order and the time the item is weighed and priced by us, the price you will be charged will be the price at the time you confirmed your order.\nFor full details, please see Butcher and Fishmonger Terms &amp.\nConditions , including terms relating to substituted items from our butcher and fishmonger..\n</p>\n<p> 2.2 The prices stated

date and time of your delivery and your delivery address and charges may vary from week to week.\n</p>\n<p> 2.4 There is a minimum order requirement of \u00a340 (excluding delivery charges) for every order placed.\nIf the customer is using a money off voucher, the puchase of cigarettes, cigars, tobacco, postage stamps and infant formula will not contribute to the minimum spend.\nThe \u00a340 minimum spend does not apply during the Christmas period, whereby the minimum order requirement will be \u00a390 (excluding delivery charges).\nThe Christmas delivery period is from 20 December to 24 December inclusive.\nThe Christmas delivery charges will be the charges applicable at the time (as determined by Ocado in its sole discretion).\n</p>\n<p> 2.5 The government introduced a charge for plastic bags in 2015, which means that by law we have to charge you.\nWe will automatically charge you 5p for each plastic bag used for your delivery, but if you give your used plastic bags back to our driver for us to recycle, we will reimburse you 5p for each plastic bag returned.\n</p>\n<p> Back to top </p> 3 METHODS OF PAYMENT <p> 3.1 Payment may be made by debit, credit or charge card and
