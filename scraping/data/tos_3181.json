we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will permanently and irrevocably anonymize your personal information, unless an exception applies.</p>\n<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship

verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must:</p>\n<p>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.\nDescribe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.\nWe will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor\u2019s identity or authority to make the request.\nWe also provide an easy-to-view snapshot of your personal information that we have processed via the \u201cMy Data\u201d tab in the Products.</p>\nResponse Timing and Format\n<p>Upon receiving a request for access,

you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n5.\nCookie-Based Marketing Opt-Out\n<p>Like most companies, we partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our marketing of Headspace on other platforms, where such advertising is based on your past visits to our Products.\nThese third party partners may use technologies, such as cookies, to gather information about your activities on the Products to deliver such advertising to you when you visit their platforms.\nFor instance, if you visit www.headspace.com, a cookie may be attached to your browser in the form of the Facebook Pixel that allows Headspace to deliver advertising to you on the Facebook platform.</p>\n<p>You can opt-out of the above-referenced cookie-based retargeting by visiting the

CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information\u2019s value and contain written terms that describe the program\u2019s material aspects.\nParticipation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>\n7.\nChanges to our CCPA Addendum\n<p>We reserve the right to amend this CCPA Addendum at our

ARBITRATION\n<p>\n<strong>DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH HEADSPACE, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM HEADSPACE INCLUDING A LIMITATION ON THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Headspace are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(b) Arbitration Rules.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute-resolution provision.\nArbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nIf the AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nThe rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.</p>\n<p>If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator.\n(2) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing.\nor (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your billing address.\nIn the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration institution.</p>\n<p>Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth in the AAA Rules with the remainder paid by Headspace.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Headspace for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(c) Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, including any unconscionability challenge or other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable, or otherwise invalid.\nThe arbitrator shall also have the exclusive authority to determine the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Headspace.\nThe dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute.\nThe arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Headspace.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(d) Jury Trial Waiver.</strong> Except where not permitted by law, you and Headspace waive any constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury.\nRather, you and Headspace elect to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration.\nIn any litigation between you and Headspace over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, you and Headspace waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(e) Class Action Waiver.</strong> WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND HEADSPACE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.\nIf, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Headspace are entitled to arbitration.\ninstead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in section 13.13 below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(f) Opt-out.</strong> YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.\nIf you do so, neither you nor Headspace can force the other to arbitrate.\nTo opt-out, you must notify Headspace in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement.\nYour notice must include your name and address, and the email address you used to set up your Headspace account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.\nYou must send your opt-out notice to one of the following physical or email addresses: Headspace, Inc., ATTN: Arbitration Opt-out, 2415 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90404.\nADR@headspace.com</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(g) Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Headspace may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(h) Public Injunction Exclusion.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may pursue a claim for public injunctive relief either in court or through arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(i) Arbitration Agreement Survival.</strong> This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Headspace.</p>\n13.13 EXCLUSIVE VENUE\n<p>To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you and Headspace agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\nIf, however, that court would lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles.\nYou and Headspace consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.</p>\n13.14 CHOICE OF LAW\n<p>Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S.\nfederal law, the laws of California, other than its conflict-of-laws principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their subject matter, including tort claims.</p>\n13.15 SEVERABILITY\n<p>If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these Terms and not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>These Terms are effective and were last updated on May 13, 2020.</p>\n<p>Headspace, Inc.\nis located at 2415 Michigan Avenue, Santa Monica, CA 90404.</p>\nGET SOME HEADSPACESUBSCRIBEREDEEM A CODESEND A
