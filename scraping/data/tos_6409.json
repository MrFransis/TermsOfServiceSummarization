to third parties.\nWe only share personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Greater Goods in the following limited circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have your consent.\nWe require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.</li>\n<li>We provide such information to our affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf.\nWe require that these parties agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>\n<li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Greater Goods, its users or the public as required or permitted by

information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, provide search results and links (including paid links), processing credit card payment, and providing customer service.\nThey have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purpose.</li>\n<li>We release account and other personal information when we believe that release is appropriate to comply with the law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Greater Goods, our users or others.\nThis includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\nObviously, however, this does not mean we sell, rent, share or disclose personal identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of commitments set forth in this Policy.</li>\n<li>If Greater Goods becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>4.\nHow secure is my information?<p>\n</p>\n<p>Your information is stored on our servers and we treat data as an asset that must be protected.\nWe use professional tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.\nThese include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.</p>\n<p>However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site.\nTherefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>\n<p>We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.\nOf course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</p>\n<p>Contractors and agents who need to know information in order to process it on our behalf are restricted in their access to personal information.\nThese individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>\n<p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer.\nBe sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>\n<p>Generally, you are automatically asked to log into your Greater Goods account when you need to access account or order information to review or change something.\nIf you have trouble logging in, here are some things to check:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorrect email address: Make sure your email address is in the following format: username@domain.com(or .net, .org, etc.).\nIf you have more than one email address, be sure that you're using the correct email address and password combination for the account you are trying to access.\nAlso, if your computer is set to auto-complete the email, make sure it's the correct email address listed.</li>\n<li>Incorrect password: If you're sure you're using the correct email address, try to reset your password.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are using a public terminal, do not forget to log off, or sign out before you leave the computer.\nYou can click the \"Log Out\" link at any time to exit your Greater Goods account to protect the security of your information.\nAfter you sign out, your name will be removed from the home page, and your ordering settings will be inaccessible to anyone using the same computer after you.\nWe recommend that you sign out only when you feel that you must.\nIf we can't identify you, it will be difficult for us to identify items that might be of interest to you.\nYou\u2019ll need to sign in again if you want to regain access to the items saved in your Shopping Cart, to place orders, or to view your recommendations.</p>\n<p>\n</p>5.\nWhat about links to other websites?<p>\n</p>\n<p>Since our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites, we promise not to disclose any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.</p>\n<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or \"serve\") the advertisements that appear on Greater Goods directly to your browser.\nThey automatically receive your IP address when this happens.\nThey may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content.\nWe do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy.\nPlease contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.</p>\n<p>\n</p>6.\nAmazon Affiliate Disclosure<p>\n</p>\n<p>Greater Goods is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</p>\n<p>\n</p>7.\nWhat choices do I have?<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can always choose to control the information stored in your Greater Goods account or choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of Greater Goods functions.</p>\n<p>You can also always add or update certain information on pages.\nIn addition, if you do not want to receive email from us, please contact us at info@greatergoods.com at any time.\n(If you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as changes of Privacy Policy, those notices will still govern your use of Greater Goods, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.)</p>\n<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.\nAdditionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.\nHowever, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of essential features of Greater Goods, we recommend that you leave them turned on.\nFor instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, etc.</p>\n<p>\n</p>8.\nHow does Greater Goods handle Do Not Track signals?<p>\n</p>\n<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>\n<p>\n</p>9.\nWhat about the California Privacy Rights?<p>\n</p>\n<p>(For California residents) As section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code required, businesses have to disclose policies relating to the sharing of certain categories of your Personal Information with third parties.\nIf you reside in California and have provided your personal information to Greater Goods, you may request information about our disclosures of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.\nSuch kind of requests can be submitted by email at info@greatergoods.com.</p>\n<p>After receiving such a request, we will provide the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of those third parties.\nThis request may be made no more than once per calendar year.\nWe reserve our right not to

circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we have gotten your written approval;</li>\n<li>To avoid urgent danger to your life, body or personal property;</li>\n<li>To avoid great harm on others\u2019 rights and benefits;</li>\n<li>To promote public benefits without harming yours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also disclose your personal information in response to the requests from government or for the purpose of public safety, and we are exempt from responsibility for the aforementioned disclosures.</p>\n<p>\n</p>10.\nCOPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<p>\n</p>\n<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>\n<p>\n</p>11.\nCAN-SPAM act<p>\n</p>\n<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>\n<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>\n<li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>\n<li> Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>\n<li> Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>\n<li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>\n<li> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.</li>\n<li> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is
