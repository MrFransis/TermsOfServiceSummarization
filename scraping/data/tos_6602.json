information<p>Select one of the options below to read more about how Samaritans and its branches uses your personal information.</p> How we use personal information If you use Samaritans\u2019 service <p>Samaritans supports people in distress through its support service.\nOur service is available by telephone, email, letter and face to face.</p>\n<p>Our telephone helpline is designed so that Samaritans volunteers can\u2019t see your phone number when you contact us.\nHowever, some information that could be used to identify you is available on our central systems and can be accessed by Samaritans Central Office staff, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If we need to investigate a call or series of calls (e.g.\nif you make a complaint), we can use an encrypted telephone number shown on our central system to identify the specific calls.</li>\n<li>If you contact jo@samaritans.org, we do our best to mask your email address by replacing it with a caller ID and message ID before it reaches a volunteer.\nIf you reply to the email we send you, your actual email address may be visible in the addressee line.\nThis depends on how your computer is set up.\nIf you would like to avoid this, you should review the whole of your email message (including any historic messages, usually shown below your current reply) and delete any mention of your email address before you press send.</li>\n<li>If you contact us by letter, the volunteer will be able to see your postal address</li>\n<li>Unlike the telephone helpline, your telephone number will be visible if you contact Samaritans Central Office</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, we try to keep as little information about you as possible.\nVolunteers may take notes when they talk to you to assist in the conversation.\nThese notes are shredded at the end of the call.\nWe don\u2019t record your phone calls to the helpline but volunteers and staff may from time to time listen in to calls for training, quality, support, or research purposes.</p>\n<p>We record some statistical information on each contact we receive, to report on and improve our service.\nThis includes non-identifiable information, such as gender and how distressed the individual was at the time of contact.\nThis information is never used to report on specific people.\nWhere we provide emotional support in locations outside of the branches, our volunteers will take steps to ensure that any notes taken for statistical purposes are kept secure and securely disposed of once the data has been entered into our central contact log.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional support</b>\n</p>\n<p>If we are concerned about you and want to offer you extra support, we may agree to call you back or for you to call us at an agreed time.\nIn these cases, we will record information you\u2019ve given us so that we know it\u2019s you when you call again.\nWe may need to share this information within Samaritans, because we work as a team to provide you with the best possible support and we want to ensure that whoever you speak to is up to date with your situation.\nThis can be helpful if you find it difficult to go over previous conversations or if you are going through a particularity difficult time.</p>\n<p>We may contact you to offer our support if you are referred to us by another organisation or individual.\nOnce we have contacted you we will destroy your contact details, unless you agree to further contact \u2013 in which case we will, with your consent, keep your contact details.\nOur additional support is not meant to be long term, it is a temporary form of extra support and is only put in place with your input and agreement.</p>\n<p>Samaritans will never pass any of your information on to any other organisation, except in the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We receive a call about acts of terrorism or bomb warnings</li>\n<li>We receive a court order requiring us to share information</li>\n<li>We are working in partnership with another organisation and you have given consent for your information to be shared</li>\n<li>You directly ask us to pass on information about you to someone else</li>\n<li>We are

on donations, it is important that Samaritans keeps the public updated on our vital work and campaigns.\nWe also need to understand how we can best attract and communicate with new and existing supporters, in order to target our resources effectively.\nThese are examples of Samaritans\u2019 \u2018legitimate interests\u2019 and are our lawful basis for using the personal information that you provide to us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>contact you by post to update you on our vital work and campaigns (from time to time these updates may include requests for financial support.\nyou can let us know that you no don\u2019t want to hear from us anymore at any time \u2013 see the \u2018Keeping in Touch\u2019 section of this Privacy Statement);</li>\n<li>invite you to participate in surveys or

Samaritans.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Profiling</b>\n</p>\n<p>Occasionally, Samaritans works with external companies who analyse our donor information to determine geographical and demographic trends.\nThis helps us to send the most effective communications to potential and existing supporters.\nWe only work with suppliers who we trust to keep the personal details of our donors safe.\nWe require our partners to comply with data protection laws and to put appropriate safeguards in place.</p>\n<p>If our research identifies that you may be willing and able to support us, we may gather additional information about you, such as professional history, affiliation with other charities and companies, trusteeships or club and livery membership, using publicly available sources.\nThese sources could include Companies House, company websites, Who\u2019s Who, Debretts, LinkedIn, Charity Commission website and recent press coverage.\nWe will use this information to determine which areas of Samaritans work might be of greatest interest to you, in order to contact you with the most relevant information to see whether you are willing to support us.</p>\n<p>We may use information from the same publicly available sources to identify who is responsible for a company\u2019s or trust\u2019s CSR, charitable giving and grant making policies and to identify an appropriate means of contact to enquire whether the organisation may consider supporting Samaritans.</p>\n<p>We may also aggregate and anonymise personal data that we collect, for research purposes.\nThis anonymous data can no longer be linked to any particular person and may be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying trends and patterns within our existing supporter base.</p> Research at Samaritans <p>Samaritans carries out research into suicide and self-harm, effective ways of providing support to people in distress and the needs and experiences of people using our services.\nWe use this to help us develop our services and to inform our work in influencing government policy.\nThis research may be carried out by Samaritans staff or volunteers, or external research teams that are supported or commissioned by Samaritans.</p>\n<p>As well as the steps that we take to ensure your personal data is protected, Samaritans has a Research Ethics Policy which applies to all research that involves contacting and collecting information from current or past callers, volunteers and members of the general public.</p>\n<p>The Research Ethics Policy requires informed consent from all individuals for all activities that involve contact between researchers (whether these are Samaritans staff, volunteers or staff from an external institution) and research participants.\nThis means that participants must be fully informed about the project, including how any personal data provided will be used and the degree of anonymity and confidentiality provided, before agreeing to take part.\nParticipants must provide positive consent (which may be written or verbal) that they are happy with the basis of the project and how their data will be used before proceeding.</p>\n<p>All electronic and hard copy data collected during research is stored securely and is accessible only by the designated researchers and for the purposes of the research project.\nData is stored for a duration of time specific to each research project but will not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of that project.\nOnce the data is no longer needed, it is destroyed.</p>\n<p>From time to time Samaritans researchers use externally hosted websites to conduct surveys.\nThese websites may be hosted in countries or jurisdictions which do not provide the same level of data protection as the countries within the European Economic Area.\nYou will be told if a website is hosted outside of the European Economic Area before you begin the survey, as well as other information about the purpose of research and how your data will be used.\nYou will also be provided with a link to the survey host\u2019s privacy statement.\nAll survey participants are required to indicate that they consent to take part before they proceed to complete the survey, so by agreeing to take part, you will be providing consent to the use of your personal details and sensitive personal data (such as information about your emotional wellbeing) and the transfer of your data outside of the European Economic Area (where applicable).</p> Making a complaint <p>Samaritans aims to provide support to the highest possible standard at all times.\nTo help achieve this, we encourage anyone who is not completely happy with the service they have received to let us know immediately, by contacting the branch involved or Samaritans Central Office Quality Team on 02083948313 or you can use the Complaints questionnaire here.</p>\n<p>All complaints will be investigated fully.\nIt is important that you give as much information as possible to enable us to investigate your complaint.\nYour information will not be passed on to anyone outside of Samaritans but in most cases we will need to involve the Director of the relevant branch.\nWith your prior consent, the Director will contact you directly to try to resolve your complaint.</p>\n<p>It is our aim to resolve a complaint within 14 days of receiving it.\nIn some cases, this isn\u2019t possible but we will do our best to resolve it as soon as we can.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or wish to add information concerning your complaint, please contact a member of our Samaritans Central Office Quality Team on 02083948313 or email feedback@samaritans.org.\nPlease be aware that if you call our central office number, your telephone number will be visible

else without your permission.</p>\n<p>We keep an ongoing record of any visits or activities that we undertake as part of the service.</p>\n<p>\n</p> Sharing your story <p>Some of our service users and supporters choose to tell us about their experiences to help further our work.\nThis may include sharing sensitive personal information relating to their health and emotional wellbeing.</p>\n<p>If we have the explicit consent of the individual, or their parent or guardian if they are under 18, we may use this information in materials promoting our campaigning and fundraising work, or in documents such as our annual report.</p> Storing your information <p>\n<b>Where we store your information</b>\n</p>\n<p>Samaritans operates across the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and stores our data within the European Economic Area (EEA).\nThree branches within Samaritans\u2019 branch network are not within the EEA: Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.\nThese jurisdictions are, however, on the European Commission\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d list of countries for transferring personal data and are subject to the same policies and procedures as Samaritans branches in the UK and Republic of Ireland.</p>\n<p>We do use \u2018cloud-based\u2019 applications provided by external suppliers to collect, store and handle some types of personal information.\nThese suppliers (e.g.\nMicrosoft) may be based outside of the EEA.\nWhere this is the case, we ask suppliers to provide evidence that they have the appropriate measures in place to ensure that your personal information is kept safe.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Security safeguards</b>\n</p>\n<p>Samaritans uses various technical and organisational measures to keep your data safe.\nElectronic data and databases are stored on secure computer systems and we control who has access to information, using both physical and electronic means.\nOur staff and volunteers receive data protection training and are provided with guidance that they are required to follow when handling personal information.</p>\n<p>Although we do our best to keep your information safe, the transmission of information over the internet is never completely secure, so please bear this in mind when you share information with us via our website.</p>\n<p>How long we keep your personal information for</p>\n<p>We only keep your personal information for as long as required, depending on what it was collected for, and in accordance with legal requirements and tax and accounting rules.</p>\n<p>If

that you provide to us to send you our updates by post.\nSo, if you volunteer, fundraise or donate to us and you have given us your postal address, we will keep you up to date with Samaritans\u2019 activities and work by post.\nWe will also ask you whether you would like to stay in touch by telephone, email or text message.\nYou can also sign up to receive news about Samaritans by email through
