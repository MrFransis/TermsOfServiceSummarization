oral or written forward-looking statements.\nStatements of this type are included in this document, and may be included in other filings with Canadian securities regulators or the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or in other communications.\nAll such statements are made pursuant to the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the U.S.\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation.\nForward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis in the Bank\u2019s 2017 Annual Report under the headings \u201cOutlook\u201d and in other statements regarding the Bank\u2019s objectives, strategies to achieve those objectives, the regulatory environment in which the Bank operates, anticipated financial results (including those in the area of risk management), and the outlook for the Bank\u2019s businesses and for the Canadian, U.S.\nand global economies.\nSuch statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintent,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d

\u201cwould\u201d and \u201ccould.\u201d</p>\n<p>By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and the risk that predictions and other forward-looking statements will not prove to be accurate.\nDo not unduly rely on forward-looking statements, as a number of important factors, many of which are beyond the Bank\u2019s control and the effects of which can be difficult to predict, could cause actual results to differ materially from the estimates and intentions expressed in such forward-looking
