by our net income, property tax, or payroll taxes.\nIf you are exempt from any such Taxes for any reason, we will exempt you from such Taxes on a going-forward basis once you deliver a duly executed and dated valid exemption certificate to our tax department and our tax department has approved such exemption certificate.\nSuch exemptions should be sent directly to taxforms@twilio.com.\nFor avoidance of doubt, the Customer will not be exempt from the Federal Universal Service Fund fees unless the Customer itself is a direct contributor to the Federal Universal Service Fund and has a contributor number that can be verified through the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website.\nIf you are exempt from VAT or GST, then it is your responsibility to provide your VAT or GST registration number to us.\nIf you provide us an exemption certificate or your VAT or GST number after you have paid Taxes, then we will provide, upon your written request, a credit to your customer account for Taxes previously paid for up to a period of three (3) months from the date of receipt of your written request.\nIf for any reason a taxing jurisdiction determines that you are not exempt from any such exempted Taxes and then assesses us such Taxes, you agree to promptly pay to us such Taxes, plus any applicable interest or penalties assessed.</p>\n<p>Should you be required by applicable law to withhold any tax from any payment owed to us, then you may provide us with an exemption certificate or similar document to reduce or eliminate any such withholding.\nUpon receipt of such certificate or document, you shall thereafter reduce or eliminate, as the case may be, such withholding.\nYou shall provide us with documents evidencing your payment of any such withheld Tax to applicable tax authorities.</p>\n<p>10.3 Payment Terms.\nYou will make all of the payments due hereunder in accordance with the following applicable payment method:</p>\n<p>10.3.1 Credit Card Payment Terms.\nIf you elect to pay via credit card, then you are responsible for either (a) enabling auto-recharge on your customer account(s) or (b) ensuring that your customer account(s) has a sufficient positive balance to cover all fees due.\nIf, for any reason, you have a negative balance on your customer account(s), then we reserve the right to suspend the Services.</p>\n<p>10.3.2 Invoicing Payment Terms.\nIf you elect to receive invoices and pay in arrears and we approve you for the same, then invoices will be sent to you via email as a PDF on a monthly basis.\nYou will make all of the undisputed fees hereunder within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice.\nUnless you and Twilio agree otherwise in writing, all undisputed fees due pursuant to these Terms are payable in United States dollars, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties in writing.\nPayment obligations can\u2019t be canceled, and fees paid are non-refundable.\nIf you are overdue on any payment of undisputed fees and fail to pay within ten (10) business days of a written notice of your overdue payment, then we may assess, and you must pay a late fee.\nThe late fee will be either 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by applicable law, whichever is less.\nFollowing the notice of non-payment, we may also suspend the Services until you pay the undisputed fees due plus any late fees.</p>\n<p>10.3.3 Suspension for Non-Payment.\nIf we suspend the Services pursuant to this Section 10.3, then we will have no liability for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits) or any other consequences that you may incur in connection with any such suspension.</p>\n<p>10.4 Fee Disputes.\nIf you are disputing any fees or Taxes, you must act reasonably and in good faith and you must cooperate diligently with Twilio to resolve the dispute.\nYou must notify us in writing if you dispute any portion of any fees paid or payable by you pursuant to these Terms.\nYou must provide that written notice to us within sixty (60) days of the date we bill you for the charge you want to dispute, and we will work together with you to resolve the dispute promptly.</p> 11.\nOwnership and Confidentiality <p>\n<em>What\u2019s ours is ours, and what\u2019s yours is yours.&nbsp.\nPlease let us know what you think about Twilio and our services.\nBy the way,

extent that the Indemnifying Party was actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.\n(b) the Indemnifying Party will have the sole and exclusive authority to defend or settle any such Claim (provided that, the Indemnifying Party will obtain the Indemnified Party's consent in connection with any act or forbearance required by the Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld).\nand (c) the Indemnified Party will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection with the Indemnifying Party\u2019s activities hereunder, at the Indemnifying Party\u2019s

our services.</em>\n</p>\n<p>17.8 Government Terms.\nWe provide the Services, including related software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with these

Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data, software, and manuals, is restricted by these Terms.\nAll other use is prohibited and no rights other than those provided in these Terms are conferred.\nThe Services were developed fully at private expense.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Other than arbitration (see the next section), if we can\u2019t agree on something and we end up having a legal dispute, then California laws will apply.\nWe definitely don\u2019t want to, but, if we have to go to court, then it will be in San Francisco, California.\nCourt isn\u2019t a great

will be determined by the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions).\nApart from Section 18, these Terms will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws and principles that would cause laws of another jurisdiction to apply.\nThese Terms will not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.\nExcept as provided in Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitration), any legal suit, action or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services shall be instituted in either the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California, and we each consent to the personal jurisdiction of these courts.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This is the only set of terms that

or addenda or other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms, these Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous proposals, statements, sales materials or presentations and agreements, oral and written.\nNo oral or written information or advice given by Twilio, its agents or employees will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the warranties or obligations under these Terms.\nAny purchase order document or similar document provided by you shall be construed solely as evidence of your internal business processes, and the terms and conditions contained thereon shall be void and have no effect with regard to these Terms between you and Twilio and be non-binding against Twilio even if signed by Twilio after the date you accept these Terms.</p> 18.\nAgreement to Arbitrate <p>\n<em>Please, please, please reach out to our Customer Support Team (they\u2019re amazing!) before bringing a legal case.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If our Customer Support Team can\u2019t help you with a dispute, then we both agree to go to binding arbitration, again, in San Francisco, California.\nArbitration means a professional arbitrator will decide how to resolve our dispute instead of a judge or a jury deciding the case.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Despite what we said above, there are some disputes that won\u2019t go to arbitration, but to court, like IP disputes and disputes about your violation of our Acceptable Use Policy.\nWe also don\u2019t have to arbitrate small claims court cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>If we arbitrate, then we\u2019ll do it through the American Arbitration Association (AAA).\nBefore we even arbitrate, though, we\u2019ll try mediation with an AAA mediator.\nIf mediation doesn\u2019t work, then we\u2019ll go to arbitration through AAA with only one arbitrator (one is so much easier).\nAnd remember, the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final and binding.</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agreement to Arbitrate</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Customer Support.\nMost disputes can be resolved that way.</p>\n<p>18.1 We Both Agree to Arbitrate.\nIf a dispute cannot be resolved through our Customer Support Team, you or any of your affiliates on one hand and Twilio and any of Twilio\u2019s affiliates on the other hand, all agree to resolve any dispute relating to these Terms or in relation to the Services by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California.</p>\n<p>This applies to all claims under any legal theory, unless the claim fits in one of the exceptions below in Section 18.2 (Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate).\nIt also applies even after you have stopped using your customer account(s) or closed it.\nIf we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that, too.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to this Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate), you understand that you and your affiliates and Twilio and its affiliates are giving up the right to have a judge and/or jury resolve any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services.</p>\n<p>18.2 Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate.\nYou and your affiliates on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that we will go to court to resolve disputes relating to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<blockquote>Your, your affiliates\u2019, Twilio\u2019s or Twilio\u2019s affiliates\u2019 intellectual property (e.g., trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents).\nor</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote>Your violation of our Acceptable Use Policy .</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in San Francisco, California, or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if it qualifies to be brought in that court.\nIn addition, if any of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated or any of us refuses to arbitrate a claim that should be arbitrated, the other of us can ask a court to force us to go to arbitration to resolve the claim (i.e., compel arbitration).\nAny of us may also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.</p>\n<p>18.3 Details of Arbitration Procedure.\nPrior to filing any arbitration, both parties jointly agree to seek to resolve any dispute between us by mediation conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA), with all mediator fees and expenses paid equally by the parties.\nIf mediation is not successful, either party may initiate an arbitration proceeding with AAA.\nYou can look at AAA\u2019s rules and procedures on their website http://www.adr.org or you can call them at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the then-current version of AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the <em>\"Rules\"</em>) and will be held with a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Rules.\nTo the extent anything described in this Section 18 conflicts with the Rules, the language of this Section 18 applies.\nEach of us will be entitled to get a copy of non-privileged relevant documents in the possession or control of the other party and to take a reasonable number of depositions.\nAll such discovery will be in accordance with procedures approved by the arbitrator.\nThis Section 18 does not alter in any way the statute of limitations that would apply to any claims or counterclaims asserted by either party.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award will be based on the evidence admitted and the substantive law of the State of California and the United States, as applicable, and will contain an award for each issue and counterclaim.\nThe award will provide in writing the factual findings and legal reasoning for such award.\nThe arbitrator will not be entitled to modify these Terms.\nExcept as provided in the Federal Arbitration Act, the arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties.\nJudgment may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<em>We both agree not to bring a class action suit against the other.\nIf for some reason a court decides that this term isn\u2019t enforceable, then this entire Section 18 will go away.</em>\n</p>\n<p>18.4 Class Action Waiver.\nBoth you and your affiliates, on one hand, and Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand, agree that any claims or controversies between us must be brought against each other on an individual basis only.\nThat means neither you and your affiliates on one hand nor Twilio and its affiliates on the other hand can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action.\nThe arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise).\nAnd, the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s or entity\u2019s case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Twilio customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.\nIf a court decides that this Section 18.4 (Class Action Waiver) is not enforceable or valid, then the entire Section 18 (Agreement to Arbitrate) will be null and void (i.e., go away).\nBut, the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p> 19.\nFun <p>\n<em>Let your imagination run wild with Twilio!</em>\n</p>\n<p>You understand and acknowledge that developing applications should be fun and easy, and by using the Services, you agree to let your imagination run wild.</p> 20.\nAdditional

policies here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Standard Contractual Clauses.</strong> Where Twilio\u2019s BCRs do not apply, including to cross-border data transfers of the SendGrid services, we rely instead on other safeguards to transfer personal information outside the EEA and Switzerland, such as European Union Model Clauses, also known as Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Twilio's Data Protection Addendum.</strong> For more information about our cross-border data transfer mechanisms, please see the Data Protection Addendum which is part of your agreement with us.\nWe provide this DPA by default, as an additional layer of protection for all our customers.</p>SendGrid Services<p>The SendGrid services work a little differently from the rest of Twilio\u2019s services, and we\u2019d like to make sure you\u2019re aware of those differences.\nMost importantly, SendGrid services are not currently covered by Twilio\u2019s Binding Corporate Rules, which means that we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (which you can find in our Data Protection Addendum) for any cross-border data transfers relating to the SendGrid services.\nHowever, even where SendGrid services are not covered by our Binding Corporate Rules, we are committed to providing a high level of data protection for our SendGrid customers.\nThere are a few other elements that are specific to the SendGrid services, and you should read on for more information.</p>Learn MoreData Collection and Email <p>For the most part, the SendGrid services collect the same data the Twilio services collect, and for the same reasons.\nThe SendGrid services also collect some additional data in the form of web beacons placed in the body of emails delivered using the SendGrid platform.\nThis allows us to keep track of whether or not an email has been delivered, opened, clicked on, whether it bounced or was treated as spam.\nYou may learn more about these web beacons on our Website Navigational Information page.</p>Customer Content and Email Recipients\u2019 Personal Information<p>Like Twilio, SendGrid is a data processor for Customer Content, like email communications contents and the contents of marketing campaigns.\nSendGrid is also a data processor for email recipients\u2019 email addresses and other recipients\u2019 personal information.</p>Data Subject Rights and Opt Outs<p>SendGrid takes reasonable steps to ensure that the data we collect is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete and up to date.\nYou can manage, access, or delete many of your account and profile settings within the dashboard provided through the SendGrid platform, including, in some instances, your end users\u2019 personal information.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can opt out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link at the bottom of our marketing messages.\nPlease note that it may take up to three days to remove your contact information from our marketing communications lists, so you may receive correspondence from us for a short time after you make your request.\nYou will not be able to opt out of service emails from us, such as billing emails, unless you deactivate your account.</p>Automated Decision Making <p>Twilio may use automated decision making using a variety of signals derived from account activity to help identify and suspend accounts sending spam or engaged in other abusive or fraudulent activity.\nHolders of accounts suspended under these circumstances are notified of the suspension and given an opportunity to request human review of the suspension decision.</p>Handling disputes relating to our data protection practices<p>We hope we can resolve any disputes relating to our data protection practices between
