<p>Since our Privacy Policy is just a few hundred words shy of 3k, we thought you might appreciate a short &amp.\neasy breakdown.\nThese highlighted bits will do precisely that!.\nNote: the framed explanations aren\u2019t legally binding and are meant to help you understand the legal language.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy will remain in effect until a new policy supersedes it.\nWe may choose to update this policy at our discretion, so you should check this page periodically as the terms may change from time to time.\nThe most recent version of the policy will be reflected by the \u201clast updated\u201d date noted at the bottom of the page.\nYour continued use of the Website and our Services will constitute your acknowledgment of the policy in its current version and your understanding of the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p>If you have a specific question, feel free to click to the appropriate section below:</p> 1.\nWhat information is collected? 2.\nHow does our Website interact with third party services and content? 3.\nWhat information do we share with third parties? 4.\nWhat choices do you have over how your information is used? 5.\nHow can you edit or delete your information? 6.\nDoes our Website respond to do-not-track signals? 7.\nWhat if I access the Website or your Services from my mobile phone, tablet or laptop? 8.\nHow do we secure your information? 9.\nWhat age do I have to be to use the Services? 10.\nWhat governing law applies? 11.\nWhat if I am in the European Economic Area? 12.\nWho should I contact with questions or concerns? 13.\nWhen was this policy last updated? 1.\nWhat information is collected?\n<p>We\u2019re based in the British Virgin Islands, which allows us to keep our VPN logs-free.\nWe don\u2019t collect any information that could lead us to know who you are or what you\u2019re up to online.</p>\n<p>Surfshark respects your privacy, therefore we are committed to not process any data related to the online activity of our users.\nSurfshark is based in the British Virgin Islands, which does not require data storage or reporting.\nWe <u>do not</u> collect IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic and other similar data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do need to keep the information you provide when you\u2019re creating your account, though.\nUsually we ask for your email address and basic billing information.\nIt\u2019s the only way we can make sure your account works.</p>\n<p>To fully use Surfshark Services, you will need to create a user account.\nWe collect the following information provided upon signup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>User\u2019s e-mail address and encrypted password.</strong> We need your email address to create and manage your account, to provide customer service, whether it\u2019s responding to a request or following up on an order, and to market products and Services that may be of interest to you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Basic billing information and order history.</strong> We collect only the basic billing information (e.\ng.\npayment amount, currency, date of the payment) and order history to process your orders and to comply with applicable legal requirements.\nWe also support anonymous payment methods (you can purchase the Services with cryptocurrency).\nIf you make payments using our third-party payment service providers, all payment data you provide will rest with them.\nTo understand what personal information the payment service providers collect and store, please refer to the respective provider\u2019s terms and privacy policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Diagnostics</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If our apps misbehave, we\u2019d appreciate a diagnostics report (it shows us what went wrong without giving away anything about you or what you do online).\nYou can opt out, but it helps us fix any issues much more efficiently.\n</p>\n<p>To maintain a perfect quality of our Services and provide you with efficient support we collect diagnostics information and monitor crash reports on our apps.\nThe information we collect contain aggregated performance data, the frequency of use of our Services, unsuccessful connection attempts and other similar information.\nAs you probably already understood, the data collected for diagnostic purposes does not contain uniquely identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information we collect on our Website and apps</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use tools like Google Analytics to keep our website working and to do marketing.\nYou can opt out of this, too - but on Google\u2019s terms.\nWe also use advertising IDs in our apps (you can opt out on your device).\nSimply said, these also don\u2019t give away anything about you personally or about what you do online.\nIt merely allows us to, for example, show ads to people who have visited our website before or to see that something on our site doesn\u2019t work quite as it should.\n</p>\n<p>The information we collect on our Website may include anonymous \u201ctraffic data\u201d provided by the host or similar provider of such information (e.\ng.\nGoogle Analytics) that does not personally identify you but may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the Services we offer.\nAnalytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting aggregate data.\nThis information may include which pages visitors visit and how long visitors may stay on a particular page.\nIt may also provide information about what browser, network, or device is used to visit our Website.\nTo learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit <strong>www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition, when you visit our Website, we may also retain your IP address, a unique identifier for your computer or other access device.\nThis helps us diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Website, or to display the content according to your preferences.</p>\n<p>When you use our app, we may collect advertising identifiers \u2013 unique, user-resettable IDs for advertising, provided by third parties (e.\ng.\nGoogle Play).\nAdvertising IDs are used for marketing purposes and user analytics and are not connected to user\u2019s personal information.\nYou can reset your identifier or opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings.</p>\n<p>When you permit us through a pop-up within our app, we collect your location data, in particular only WiFi name (Service Set Identifier), for the purpose of enabling \u201cAuto-connect\u201d feature, which extends to \u201cTrusted WiFi\u201d networks.\nThis feature allows our app to automatically connect to a server without your worry about it.\nHowever, please rest assured that we do not share this location data to any third party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and web beacons</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most of the sites on the internet use cookies, as they\u2019re pretty convenient.\nIf you want to, you can reject those, but some things may not work completely or as well as they should.\nWe also use web beacons, but if you reject cookies, they won\u2019t work either.\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a small string of information that transfers to your computer for identification purposes.\nCookies can be used to follow your activity on the Website and that information helps websites to understand your preferences and improve your website experience.\nYou can turn off all cookies in the event you prefer not to receive them.\nYou can also have your computer warn you whenever cookies are being used.\nThere are also software products available that can manage cookies for you.\nPlease be aware, however, that when you choose to reject cookies, this choice may limit the functionality of the Website and you may lose access to some of its features.</p>\n<p>A web beacon is an invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a web page, web-based document or e-mail message.\nIt helps us do things like view the URL of the page on which the beacon appears and the time the Website, document or email in question is viewed.\nThey can be used to confirm the receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to friends and family.\nand they help deliver a more personalized online experience.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Privacy beyond VPN products</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We also have other products in addition to Surfshark.\nYou can read more about their specific terms by clicking the links down below.\n</p>\n<p>Detailed privacy related information regarding additional Surfshark products can be accessed here and here.</p>\n2.\nHow does our Website interact with third party services and content?\n<p>It takes a village to keep a VPN up and running.\nWe need third-party tools and services for things like marketing, payments, live chat, and so forth.\nSince these don\u2019t belong to us, we urge you to read their terms &amp.\npolicies on their sites.\n</p>\n<p>We use third-party service providers to help handle parts of our business.\nThese parties will only use the minimum amount of your data as specified above in Clause 1 for the purpose of carrying out the work as agreed with us.\nSuch service providers are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Marketing service providers \u2013 we use them to manage our contacts and automate our marketing.</li>\n<li>Third-party payment providers \u2013 they help us to process payments together with our own authorized payment processing companies.</li>\n<li>Storage ad infrastructure providers and Ads service providers \u2013 they help us to deliver targeted advertising to the Website visitors.</li>\n<li>Live chat and support service providers \u2013 we use them to provide live chat technology and provide support to our users.</li>\n<li>Security service providers \u2013 we work with them to provide improved security and performance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some links may take you outside of our Website and are beyond our control.\nPlease note that these other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.\n<u>We urge you to review the equivalent data protection, privacy, and cookie policies available on their websites.\nWe do not accept any responsibility or liability for the data protection of privacy practices of third parties in relation to such websites and your use of third party websites is entirely at your own responsibility.</u>\n</p>\n3.\nWhat information do we share with third parties?\n<p>Can\u2019t share much when you don\u2019t really collect anything beyond what\u2019s strictly necessary.\nWe strictly do not disclose what little we do have, unless a court may order us to (our Warrant Canary page will display if we\u2019re ever asked to do so).\n</p>\n<p>As you probably already understood we do not have much information to share.\nEven so, we do not disclose your information to others, unless we are ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so.\nWe do not sell or trade your data with anyone.</p>\n4.\nWhat choices do you have over how your information is used?\n<p>You can opt out of marketing emails (but we do need to keep your address so that we can send you, for example, a reset link for your password in case you ever forget it).\nFeel free to opt out of cookies - a Google search will help you out with specific instructions for your device or browser.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Email \u2013 Those who wish to opt-out from receiving emails will have their address removed within 1-10 days of receipt of their request to opt-out or to unsubscribe at support@surfshark.com or by clicking \u201cunsubscribe\u201d at the bottom of any correspondence.\nIf you have multiple email addresses, you will need to opt-out for each address in order to be removed from our active database.</li>\n<li>Cookies and web beacons \u2013 Your browser may offer the ability to block or delete cookies from your device.\nPlease follow your individual browser\u2019s instructions on how to block and clear cookies.</li>\n</ol>\n5.\nHow can you edit or delete your information?\n<p>If you want your information edited or your account permanently deleted, email us at support@surfshark.com.\nThe only reason why we may not be able to do that is if there\u2019s still something unresolved going on or if we are legally required to keep some info.</p>\n<p>If you would like to edit your information or permanently delete your account, you can email us at <strong>support@surfshark.com</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you request, we will delete your information specified in Clause 1, unless, we are legally required to maintain certain personal data, including situations such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If there is an unresolved issue relating to your account, such as an outstanding credit on your account or an unresolved claim or dispute we will retain the necessary information about you until the issue is resolved;</li>\n<li>Where we are required to retain the information about you for our legal, tax, audit, and accounting obligations, we will retain only the necessary information for the period required by applicable law.\nand/or,</li>\n<li>Where necessary for our legitimate business interests such as fraud prevention or to maintain the security of our users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please keep in mind, that one of our most important principals is No-logs Policy (see more in our Terms of Service), therefore we collect only the minimum amount of information about you, which is required to provide you with our Services.</p>\n6.\nDoes our Website respond to do-not-track signals?\n<p>Currently, it doesn\u2019t.\nYou can tweak your specific browser settings to achieve very similar things.</p>\n<p>At this time Surfshark does not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include \u2018do-not-track\u2019 instructions.\nHowever, you can change your privacy preferences regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies through your browser.\nYou may set your browser to accept all cookies, block certain cookies, require your consent before a cookie is placed in your browser, or block all cookies.\nPlease note, blocking all cookies will affect your online experience and may prevent you from enjoying the full features offered by our Website.</p>\n7.\nWhat if I access the Website or your Services from my mobile phone, tablet or laptop?\n<p>The same things stand that we talked about in section \u201cWhat information is collected\u201d at the very top of this Privacy Policy.\nBasically, we don\u2019t collect much, and you can opt out of most of it.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a visitor of our Website, but not a user of our Services, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes as specified above in Clause 1 notwithstanding the device or application you use.\nIf you are a user of our Services and access our website using one or more of our applications notwithstanding the device, application, or browser extensions, we collect and use information in the same way and for the same purposes as specified above in Clause 1.</p>\n8.\nHow do we secure your information?\n<p>We really care about your security &amp.\nprivacy and do a lot to protect it.\nHowever, anyone who tells you that 100% anything-proof security is possible either doesn\u2019t know much about it or is trying to mislead you.\nPlease keep that in mind.\n</p>\n<p>We have implemented various security measures, including SSL/TLS encryption for data transfers, hashed passwords, firewalls, and regular audits.\nWe take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely.</p>\n<p>While we implement security measures on our Website and through our Services, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.\nWhenever you give out your information online there is a risk that a third party may intercept and use that information.\nWhile we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.\nBy using the Services, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through the Services and that any general information, other data or information received from you through the Website or our Services is provided at your own responsibility.</p>\n9.\nWhat age do I have to be to use the Services?\n<p>18 or older.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Surfshark is not intended for users under the age of 18.</u> Such users are expressly prohibited from submitting any of their information to us, and from using portions of the Website for which registration is required.\nIf any information is submitted by such users, it will not be collected or retained.</p>\n10.\nWhat governing law applies?\n<p>We\u2019re based in the British Virgin Islands, so we play by their rules (which are pretty great when it comes to user privacy).\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and our privacy practices will be subject exclusively to the laws of the British Virgin Islands.\nBy using our Website or our Services, you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of British Virgin Islands any claim or matter arising under or in connection with the Website or our Services.</p>\n11.\nWhat if I am in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d)?\n<p>Basically, we respect GDPR, and you can ask us to delete stuff or implement any other of your rights by emailing us at support@surfshark.com.\n</p>\n<p>You may be aware that a new European Union law called the General Data Protection Regulation or \u201cGDPR\u201d gives certain rights to individuals in relation to their personal data.\nAccordingly, we have implemented additional transparency to help users take advantage of those rights.\nAs available and except as limited under applicable law, individuals have the rights described below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are based in the EEA, you can access your personal information or receive a copy of it by contacting us.</li>\n<li>If you are based in the EEA, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information where it is technically possible.</li>\n<li>Similarly, if you are based in the EEA, if we have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time.\nWithdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>\n<li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> of your habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement and file a complaint regarding our collection and use of your personal information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wish to implement any of the above-mentioned rights, please contact us at <strong>support@surfshark.com</strong>.\nWe respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Retention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We keep some data (from Clause 1) to do things like process your order or analytics for as long as you use Surfshark and no more than 2 years after you stop.</p>\n<p>We keep information about you as specified in Clause 1 only as required by law or as long as necessary for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as fulfilling an order, making data-driven business decisions about new features and offerings, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.\nSurfshark stores the information specified in Clause 1 for the whole period when the Surfshark Services are used and for no longer than 2 years after that.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your data from Clause 1 may travel around the world a bit, but we always take extra care to keep it safe and sound.\n</p>\n<p>Your information as specified in Clause 1 may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers.\nWhen you use our Services, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located outside of the country where you reside.\nIf you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, please note that we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to transfer your personal information from the EEA or Switzerland to other countries.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Basis for Processing Your Personal Information (EEA Visitors Only)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We treat your data in accordance with GDPR.\nIf you have any specific questions, we\u2019ll be happy to answer them - email us at support@surfshark.com.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a user located in the EEA, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.\nWe will normally collect personal information from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate business interests.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use information specified in Clause 1, please contact us using the contact details provided below.</p>\n12.\nWho should I contact with questions or concerns?\n<p>Our 24/7 Customer Success Team will help you out as soon as they can.\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or comments relating to Surfshark Services or this Privacy Policy, send an email to <strong>support@surfshark.com</strong> or chat with us on the Website.</p>\n13.\nWhen was this policy last updated?\n<p>Keep in mind that we can update this Policy in the future &amp.\ncheck it regularly.\n</p>\n<p>May 4, 2020.</p> Surfshark <ul>\n<li>Features</li>\n<li>Use cases</li>\n<li>What is a VPN</li>\n<li>VPN free

(\u201cServices\u201d).\nServices include, but are not limited to VPN and other software, extensions, applications, information and content made available to you by Surfshark.\nA VPN is a secure way

services.\nWith Surfshark you can connect to different VPN servers worldwide to ensure the privacy of your location.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t collect logs or any other information that\u2019d let us identify you.\nThe only things we do collect are strictly necessary to provide you with our services.\nYou can find more details about that in the Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>No-logs Policy</b> is one of the most important features of our Services.\nIt means your activities are not in any way logged, retained, or transferred to third parties when you connect to our Services.\nWe do not collect IP addresses, browsing history, session information, used bandwidth, connection time stamps, network traffic and other similar data.\nWe can ensure such policy as we are based in the British Virgin Islands, which does not require data storage or reporting, and processes related to provision of our Services are automated.\nMoreover, only very limited user data collected from or provided by you is processed in order to provide Services to you.\nMore information on what information is collected about you and how it is used can be found in our Privacy Policy at <b>https://surfshark.com/privacy-policy</b>.\nOur Privacy Policy is incorporated herein by reference.</p>\n<p>No shady stuff, please.</p>\n<p>We do not approve any unlawful, illicit, criminal or

will not be liable in any way or form for illegal actions done by you arising through or from the use of our Services.</p>\n2.\nDo I have to create an account?\n<p>Yup.\nAnd you\u2019re responsible for it.\n</p>\n<p>In order to use some of the Surfshark Services, you will be asked to set up an account.\nYou are solely responsible for all usage or activity on your account including, but not limited to, use of the account by any person who uses your account, with or without authorization, or who has access to any computer on which your account resides or is accessible.</p>\n3.\nWhat

password, either with or without your knowledge.\nWe reserve the right to terminate your account at any time.</p>\n4.\nWhat is Surfshark payment and refund policy?\n<p>We can refund you on the basis of our 30-day money-back guarantee.\nExcept if you signed up via iTunes/App Store/Amazon or with a prepaid card/gift card.\nThese are out of our hands.\n</p>\n<p>You can subscribe to Surfshark Services on a service period basis.\nAfter signing up for Surfshark Services you may choose a payment method.\nOnly some of our Services are free of charge.</p>\n<p>Paid Surfshark Services renew automatically at the end of each service period and your chosen payment method is charged again, unless you decide to cancel your automatic payments before the automatic renewal.\nSurfshark may change the price for the subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, or other subscription terms from time to time and will communicate any price or other changes to you in advance.\nSubject to

granted a refund once, you can get the second refund if the period between both cancellations for which you claim refund is not less than 6 months.\nIf you purchase our Services again after the second refund, you will not be granted a refund for any further cancellation.</p>\n<p>As a rule, you have no right to claim a refund after the period of 30 days from the purchase has passed.\nNevertheless, in the exceptional cases, we will consider refund beyond such 30-days period, at our sole discretion, if you can demonstrate that the Services which you purchased were not available or usable and that you made reasonable attempts to contact us regarding this issue.\nIn such a case, we may provide you with a pro-rata refund of Services\u2019 fees paid during the subscription period when the Services were not available or usable.\n</p>\n<p>If you purchase our subscription through iTunes/App Store/Amazon \u2013 we are not able to grant you a refund, as subscriptions purchased via the iTunes/App

resellers.\nIn this case, refunds are handled according to the terms and conditions of the reseller from which the product was purchased.</p>\n<p>Payments made using prepaid cards or gift cards are not refunded.\nFor payments made in cryptocurrency, the equivalent amount in US Dollars is refunded in the same cryptocurrency (based on the rate of exchange at the moment of refund).</p>\n<p>You have a right to cancel your account at any time, however, canceled accounts will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing service period.\nNo refunds will be considered for accounts terminated for violation of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Any fees charged by Surfshark are exclusive of taxes.\nNethertheless, we may calculate and add taxes or duties, including, but not limited to VAT, GST and other
