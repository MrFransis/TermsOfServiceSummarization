Services.\nTo provide you with a consistent user experience and to recognize you as a user across our Services, we may collect and combine data as described below.\nfor example, data collected when

password.\n</li>\n<li>Product, ownership, and service information about your kitchen appliances and accessories, including those that are manufactured by Yummly as well as any that are capable of working with the Yummly app (for example, if you use the App to remotely control a kitchen appliance, we will collect information from the appliance manufacturer that we need to make the App work);</li>\n<li>Information you voluntarily provide about yourself, such as allergies, dietary restrictions, food preferences, and groceries that you want to purchase;</li>\n<li>Your preferences,

necessary Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain services or features.\nIf you choose not to share your Personal Data, features that require personalization will not work for you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Data From Others.</em> Other parties may provide us with Personal Data.\nFor example, if you create a Yummly account using your login from an other party\u2019s service (including a social media network such as Facebook), we will access and collect the information about you that your privacy settings on that service permit so that we can create an account for you.\nAlso, we may collect information that you make available to Whirlpool or other manufacturers of kitchen appliances and accessories (like information about your appliance to allow us to send cooking times and temperatures to the appliance) if this is related to providing the Services to you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Use of Personal Data.</em> We use your Personal Data to provide our Services and administer your inquiries.\nFor example, when you create an account through the Services and become a Registered User or when you choose to create your own profile, we may ask you for Personal Data so we can create your account or populate your profile (see \"<strong>Registered Users</strong>\" below).\nWe may also use your Personal Data to update our Services or features, troubleshoot, protect our Sites, Apps,

certain Personal Data.\nThe profile page may be viewable by other Yummly users and will display your profile name as well as your profile picture, if you choose to upload one or agree to allow a Third-party service (like Facebook) to provide one for you.\nYou can choose what other Personal Data you provide as part of your profile.\nProviding such information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with Yummly and its users.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Other Information.</em> Other Information will be considered Personal Data if it is combined with other data in such a way that enables you to be identified.\nHowever, where Other Information is taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information, it will not be treated as Personal Data.\nWe may use Other Information for any purpose, unless prohibited by law.\n</p>\n<p>We may combine your Personal Data with Other Information and aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Services are used.\nWe may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically \u2013 for instance, to deliver information to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Usage Information.</em> When you visit or use the Services or use a Yummly website or mobile application that has Yummly features (like the Yum button), our servers automatically record information that your browser or mobile device sends or transmits (\"<strong>Usage Information</strong>\").\nThis Usage Information may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type or the webpage you were

access times and dates, the model and device ID number of your mobile device, user settings, location (if you enable this feature), and statistics and information about your use of the Site and App.\nWe use this information to provide and improve the Services, develop new products, and offer products and services that may be of interest to you.\nWe also use Usage Information to monitor and analyze use of the Services, for technical administration, to secure the Site and App and protect those who visit the Site or App, to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Services to our visitors' needs.\nFor example, some of this information is collected so that when you revisit the Services, we will recognize you and can serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.\nSome of the Usage Information (like your IP address) is treated as Personal Data.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Cookies.</em> Like many websites, we use cookies, pixels, web beacons, APIs and similar technologies to collect Usage Information.\nPixels and web beacons are small pieces of code placed on web pages and content that communicate when the page or content has been viewed.\nA cookie is a small data file that your browser places on your computer that helps us understand how you interact with the Site and use our Services.\nWe use two types of cookies.\nWe use persistent cookies to save information like your search preferences, your account settings and login information, so that we can remember you and your settings when you return to the Site or App, and personalize your experience.\nWe use session cookies to enable certain features of our Services, but unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you leave or log off and/or when you close your browser.\nThird-party advertisers on the Site or in the App may also place or read cookies on your browser.\nMost Internet browsers automatically accept cookies but you can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.\nIf you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of or all functionality of our Services.</p>\n<p>We also use other parties (including Google Analytics and Mixpanel) to provide usage analytics for our Services.\nThese other parties will place their own cookies to collect traffic and activity data in order to deliver us relevant metrics and information.\nThe collection of this data by these other parties is subject to their own privacy notices.\n</p>\n2.\nLegal Basis for Processing\n<p>Below is an explanation of the different legal grounds we have for processing your Personal Data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>To satisfy our

troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce our agreements, and take other actions permitted by law.</p>\n4.\nInformation Shared with Others\n<p>We only share your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Notice.\nThrough the Services, you are able to share your Personal Data when you share something through our Service (like when you use the Yum button), when you give us your

our Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by another party or hosted directly on our Website.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statements of the companies and social media networks providing them.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Service Providers.</em> We may share any of your data with companies and individuals we engage to facilitate our Services, to provide services to us or on our behalf, to perform related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database

the event of bankruptcy.</p>\n5.\nInternational Transfers\n<p>The Services are offered globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally.\nIn particular, your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where Yummly and our servers are located.\nThe data protection and other laws of other countries, such as the United States, may not be as comprehensive as those in your country.\nThe processing activities performed by Yummly may be regulated by data protection laws in your own country, in addition to U.S.\nprivacy laws.\nWe rely on

to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>be informed on the purposes and methods of the processing of your Personal Data;</li>\n<li>ask for access to your Personal Data (commonly known as making a \"<strong>data subject access request</strong>\").\nThis enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Data we hold about you;</li>\n<li>ask for updating or rectification of the Personal Data we hold about you.\nThis enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;</li>\n<li>request erasure of your Personal Data.\nThis enables you to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.\nYou can also ask us to delete or remove your Personal

your request of erasure for reasons which will be communicated to you, if applicable, at the time of your request;</li>\n<li>restrict the processing of your Personal Data.\nThis enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy.\n(b) where you allege that our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.\n(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.\nor (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;</li>\n<li>object to the processing, wholly or partly, of your Personal Data where we are relying on legitimate
