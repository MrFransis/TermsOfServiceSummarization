or more parties are joint controllers in regard to processing of Personal Data, as in the case of Personal Data processed within the scope of Capture Projects or the Mapillary Marketplace, the joint controllers are to determine their respective responsibilities according to the GDPR.\nThis determination is made through an internal arrangement between the joint controllers.\nThe internal arrangement in force between Mapillary and the Organization/Requester that you collect images for can be found in Mapillary\u2019s Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>Mapillary processes Personal Data under this joint controllership for the purposes and on such legal basis as set out in section C above, and as otherwise stipulated in this Policy.\nYou can always contact Mapillary at support@mapillary.com if you have any questions regarding your Personal Data processed under joint controllership, or if you wish to exercise any of your rights under this Policy or the GDPR.\nFor the purposes and legal basis of the Requester/Organization, we refer you to their respective privacy policy.</p>\n<p>If the Requester/Organization is a private individual acting in their private capacity, Mapillary is instead the sole data controller of Personal Data processed within the scope of the Mapillary Marketplace or Capture Projects, and this Policy (except for this section D) applies to that processing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>E.\nSharing Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not disclose, sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior consent.\nIf you do consent but later change your mind, you may contact us and we will cease any such activity.\nWe only share your Personal Data as follows:</p>\n<p>(i) at your direction and control via your normal and intended operation of the Service, or with your consent, for example, when you agree to our sharing your Personal Data with other selected third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies;</p>\n<p>(ii) with service providers, consultants or similar contractors, Requesters/Organizations (within the scope of Capture Projects or the Mapillary Marketplace), or third parties who provide services or content in connection with our Service in order to support or enhance our or such parties\u2019 products and services or our or such parties\u2019 business operations, or to make available and consummate initiated transactions;</p>\n<p>(iii) to comply with laws or respond to lawful requests and legal process or to enforce or apply our terms of use/service, license terms, or other agreements between us, and to protect the rights, safety and property of Mapillary, our agents, employees, customers, members, and others;and</p>\n<p>(iv) under written obligations of confidentiality, in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, or dissolution, transaction, or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.</p>\n<p>We may also share and disclose Nonpersonal Data for the same purposes as described above.</p>\n<p>When other companies, e.g.\nour service providers, process your Personal Data on our behalf, we always enter into binding data processing agreements that ensure that your Personal Data always enjoys the same level of protection as under this Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>F.\nNo Guarantee of Security</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We apply appropriate technical and organizational safeguards and take all reasonable steps to help protect your Personal Data in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.\nHowever, no one can create a completely secure website, app or service and third parties may unlawfully intercept, steal or access transmissions or private communications.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee that your Information or private communications that you transfer over the internet to us will always be secure or remain confidential.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>G.\nPassword</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your password deserves careful thought and protection.\nUse unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone.\nYou shall not share your password or your personal sign-in credentials with others, and please remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account.\nIf you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Data and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf.\nIf your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access your profile to change your password and notify us immediately at support@mapillary.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>H.\nInternational Transfers</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may process Information on servers located in a number of countries.\nAccordingly, we may share Information with our service providers and affiliated companies for such companies to carry out any of the activities specified in this Policy.\nWe may also subcontract processing to or share Information with third parties located in countries other than your home country.\nInformation collected within the European Economic Area, for example, be transferred to, and processed by our affiliates or other third parties identified above that are located in, a country outside of the EEA.\nHowever, regardless of country, we will always process Information in accordance with this Policy.\nIn respect to our service providers, we will always enter into a data processing agreement that ensure that their processing gives the same level of protection to your Personal Data as this Policy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the above, any transfer of Personal Data from the EEA to a third country outside the EEA, will only be made if permitted by the applicable EU Personal Data protection regulation.\nThis means that we will only initiate such transfer of Personal Data if the receiving country outside the EEA has been deemed by the EU Commission to ensure an appropriate level of protection, if we have entered into the Commission\u2019s standard data protection clauses with the receiving company, or if there are other safeguards in place that permits such a transfer.\nYou can receive a copy of such safeguards by e-mailing support@mapillary.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I.\nChildren</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Services are not directed at or intended for children under sixteen (16) years of age, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from such children.\nIf you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, please contact us at support@mapillary.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>J.\nPolicy Changes</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may amend this Policy from time to time.\nIf we make any changes to this Policy, we will post the amended terms on Mapillary.com, change the \"Last Updated\" date above, and where appropriate, notify you by email or via our other notification mechanisms.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>K.\nYour Information, Rights and Choices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing or promotional purposes.\nWe will usually inform you (before collecting your Personal Data) if we intend to use your Personal Data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes.\nYou may also opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in the emails themselves or by emailing support@mapillary.com.\nIf you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations.</p>\n<p>You can see, review and change your Personal Data by logging into the Service or by contacting us at support@mapillary.com.\nYou should promptly update your Personal Data if it changes or is inaccurate.</p>\n<p>You have the right to receive confirmation on whether or not we process Personal Data concerning you, and in such cases get access to such Personal Data and also information regarding the Personal Data and how we process it.</p>\n<p>You have the right to have inaccurate Personal Data concerning you rectified without undue delay.\nTaking into account the purposes of the processing, you also have the right to have incomplete Personal Data about you completed.</p>\n<p>You have, under certain circumstances, the right to have Personal

that you had given your consent to.</p>\n<p>In some circumstances you have the right to obtain restriction of the processing of your Personal Data.\nFor example if you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data, you can also require that we restrict the processing of your Personal Data for such a period that enables us to verify the accuracy of the Personal Data.</p>\n<p>You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Data that is based on our legitimate interests.\nIf this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your Personal Data.</p>\n<p>You have the right to receive the Personal Data relating to you and that you have provided to us, in a commonly used electronic format.\nYou have the right to transmit that data to another controller (data portability).</p>\n<p>You may always contact Mapillary at support@mapillary.com if you have any questions or comments regarding our processing of your Personal Data.\nYou also have the right to complain about the processing of your Personal Data by lodging a complaint to the relevant data protection authority.</p>\n<p>You may delete your account any time by emailing support@mapillary.com.\nDeletion is your sole means of terminating your account.\nWe will in our own discretion keep

information about you.</p>\n<p>A.&nbsp;\u201cDo Not Track\u201d under the California Online Privacy Protection Act.\nWe support \u201cdo not track\u201d (a preference you may be able to set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked).\nWe are not aware of any processes for others collecting information about your activities on our websites over time and across

\"Shine the Light\" law (Civil Code Section \u00a7 1798.83).\nThis law permits users of our website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information, as defined by the Shine the Light law, to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nTo make such a request, please send an email to us at privacy@mapillary.com.</p>\n<p>C.&nbsp;California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nThis part (C) serves as a privacy notice for California residents and applies solely to residents of California.\nAny terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this part (C).\nNote that provision of this CCPA notice is not an admission on our part that we are a \u201cbusiness\u201d within the meaning of the CCPA, and nothing in this policy may be construed as such an admission.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Personal Information we collect</em>\n</p>\n<p>We collect certain \u201cPersonal Information,\u201d as defined by the CCPA and as listed in section B of the main body of the Privacy Policy and have done so within the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>Personal Information does not include: (a) publicly available information from government records.\n(b) deidentified information or aggregate consumer information.</p>\n<p>We obtain the categories of Personal Information listed in section B of the main body of the Privacy Policy listed above from the following categories of sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>directly from you or publicly available sources.</li>\n<li>indirectly when you use our services (eg

Information we collect for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to fulfill or meet the reason you provided the Personal Information.\nFor example, if you share your name and contact information to request a price quote or ask a question about our offerings, we will use that Personal Information to respond to your inquiry.\nIf you provide your Personal Information to purchase a access to our service, we will use that information to process your payment and facilitate delivery.</li>\n<li>to provide, support, personalize, and develop our website, products, and services.</li>\n<li>to create,

functionality.</li>\n<li>to evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us is among the assets transferred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not collect additional categories of Personal Information or use the Personal Information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes as those set out above, or in section C in the main body of the Privacy Policy above, without providing you notice.</p>\n<p>We do not sell Personal Information as the term \u201csell\u201d is defined in the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Sharing Personal Information</em>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose any or all of the categories above of your Personal Information to third parties for a business purpose, as set forth in this policy, and we have done so in the last 12 months.</p>\n<p>We disclose your Personal Information for a business purpose to the categories of third parties set out in section E in the main body of the Privacy Policy above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Your rights and choices</em>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months.\nOnce we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you (unless an exception applies):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the categories of Personal Information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>the categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you.</li>\n<li>our business or commercial purpose for collecting that Personal Information.</li>\n<li>the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information.</li>\n<li>the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a Personal Data portability request).</li>\n<li>if we disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, a list of disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not provide these Personal Data access and portability rights for B2B Personal Information to the extent such an exception remains in effect under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Deletion request rights</em>\n</p>\n<p>California residents have the right under the CCPA to request that we delete any of their Personal Information that we have collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions.\nOnce we receive and confirm a verifiable consumer request (see below), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) relevant Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies (such as the B2B exception referenced above).</p>\n<p>We may deny California residents\u2019 deletion request if doing so is permitted or required by applicable law, or if retaining the Personal Information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>complete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with the requesting individual, or otherwise perform our contract with a requesting individual.</li>\n<li>detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>\n<li>debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>\n<li>exercise free speech, ensure the right of another to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>\n<li>engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the Personal Information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>\n<li>enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations.</li>\n<li>comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n<li>make other internal and lawful uses of that Personal Information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Verifiable consumer request</em>\n</p>\n<p>To exercise the access, Personal Data portability, and deletion rights under the CCPA described above, please submit to us a verifiable consumer request as set forth above.</p>\n<p>Only a California resident may make a verifiable consumer request related to their Personal Information.\nA California resident may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of their minor child.</p>\n<p>A verifiable consumer request for Personal Data access or portability can only be made twice within a 12-month period.\nThe verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify the California resident about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative, and contain sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.\nWe cannot respond to your request or provide Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.</p>\n<p>Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account on our website.\nHowever, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account.\nWe will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>\n<p>We will endeavour to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.\nIf we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.\nIf you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.\nIf you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically.</p>\n<p>Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request\u2019s receipt.\nThe response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\nFor Personal Data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the Personal Information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>\n<p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Non-discrimination</em>\n</p>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.\nExcept as permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>deny you goods or services.</li>\n<li>charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>\n<li>provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n<li>suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>\n</ul>", "created_at": "2021-02-01 20:40:56.461882", "updated_at": "2021-02-01 20:40:59.650347"}, {"id": 3913, "name": "Commercial Terms", "url":
