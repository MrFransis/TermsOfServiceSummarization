achieve the purposes described below.\nSuch technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with this Application.\n</p>\n<p> For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br> For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker.\nFor this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\n</p>\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent.\nWhenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>This Application uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers).\nUnless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br>\nThe validity and expiration periods of Cookies and other similar Trackers may vary depending on the lifetime set by the Owner or the relevant provider.\nSome of them expire upon termination of the User\u2019s browsing session.<br>\nIn addition to what\u2019s specified in the descriptions within each of the categories below, Users may find more precise and updated information regarding lifetime specification as well as any other relevant information \u2013

related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>\n<p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>\n<p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User\u2019s initial consent.</p>\n<p>Other Trackers in the browser\u2019s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>\n<p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p> Locating Tracker Settings\n<p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings, such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings, view and look for the relevant setting).</p> Advertising industry specific opt-outs\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.\nSuch initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.\nThe Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.\n</p> Owner and Data Controller <p>\n<b>Truestamp Inc.</b>\n<br>548 Market St Ste 82200\n<br>San Francisco, CA 94104</p>\n<p>\n<b>Owner contact email:</b>

contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification.\nUsers can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.</p>\nWho the right of withdrawal applies to\n<p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>\n<p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>\nExercising the right of withdrawal\n<p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>\n<p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of this document.\nUsers are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way.\nIn order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.</p>\n<p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Regarding the purchase of a service</strong>, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.</li>\n</ul> Effects of withdrawal\n<p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>\n<p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User\u2019s decision to withdraw from the contract.\nUnless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction.\nIn any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>\n\u2026on the purchase of services\n<p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>\n<p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p> Legal guarantee of conformity for goods\n<p>Under EU law, for a minimum period of 2 years after delivery, traders guarantee the conformity of the goods they sell.\nThis means that traders must ensure that the goods purchased have the promised quality, or the quality that can be reasonably expected, functionality or characteristics for at least two years after they\u2019ve been delivered to the purchaser.</p>\n<p>Where Users qualify as European Consumers, the legal guarantee of conformity for goods applies to the items available on this Application in accordance with the laws of the country of their habitual residence.</p>\n<p>National laws of such country may grant such Users broader rights.</p>\n<p>Consumers who do not qualify as European may benefit from legal guarantee of conformity rights in accordance with the legislation of the country of their habitual residence.</p> Liability and indemnificationEU UsersIndemnification\n<p>The User agrees to indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders,
