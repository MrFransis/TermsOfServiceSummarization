your age, you may not be eligible to participate in certain Sweepstakes.\nSponsors and Trufan.io both reserve the right to set age restrictions and ban or disqualify any person from any Sweepstakes if either the Sponsor or Trufan.io believe, in either of their sole and arbitrary discretion, that such person has not met the age threshold restriction for such Sweepstakes.\nViolation of age restrictions may result in suspension or deletion of your Account.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3.5 Restricted Territories.&nbsp;If you are a Sponsor, you agree that you will not make available or promote your Sweepstakes in the Canadian Province of Quebec or Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S.\nVirgin Islands or other U.S.\nterritories.\nYou further agree that you will not make available or promote your Sweepstakes in the U.S.\nState of Florida unless your Sweepstakes complies with Florida Statutes Section 849.094, or in the U.S.\nState of New York unless your Sweepstakes complies with New York State General Business Law Section 369-e, both of which in certain circumstances require registration of the Sweepstakes in advance, a form of financial security for offered prizes, and certification of winners to the state.</p>\n<p>3.6 Legal Restrictions and Minimum Age.&nbsp;Sponsors may set age restrictions and other restrictions on entry for their Sweepstakes.\nIf you are a Sponsor, you agree to ensure, and are solely responsible for ensuring, that your Sweepstakes have appropriate age restrictions on entry and other restrictions as required by law.\nFor example, if a prize is alcohol, the Sweepstakes must restrict entry from persons under the drinking age in such persons\u2019 jurisdiction and must also restrict entry from persons where it is unlawful to distribute alcohol without legal authorization.\nThe foregoing is not a complete list of legal obligations with respect to alcohol and is provided for illustrative purposes only.\n</p>\n<p>Additionally, Sponsors must flag any mature content or prizes relating to a Sweepstakes (for example, mature video games or prizes involving alcohol) and ensure such content or prizes are not marketed or made available to persons unless they are of lawful age to view or receive such content or prize, in accordance with the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Sweepstakes is offered.\nSponsors are solely responsible for apprising themselves of the laws of the jurisdictions in which they offer their Sweepstakes.\nIn no event will any information made available from Trufan.io be deemed legal advice.</p>\n<p>3.7 Prize.&nbsp;When creating a Sweepstakes, the Sponsor must disclose to Trufan.io a description (\u201c<strong>Prize Description</strong>\u201d) of the Sweepstakes\u2019 prize (\u201c<strong>Prize</strong>\u201d) and its approximate retail value (\u201c<strong>Value</strong>\u201d).\nSponsor\u2019s must not offer a Prize with a Value greater than $5,000 USD.\n&nbsp;By creating a Sweepstakes, Sponsors represent and warrant to Trufan.io and all participants in the Sweepstakes that the Prize Description and Value are accurate.\nPrizes must be lawful in all jurisdictions where they are offered.\nIn no event may a Prize be a weapon or a controlled substance.</p>\n<p>3.8 Sponsorship of Sweepstakes.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that the Sponsor is the sponsor of the Sweepstakes created by that Sponsor.\nAmong other things, this means that the Sponsor is solely responsible and liable for: (a) except as provided in Section 3.2, administration of the Sweepstakes.\n(b) delivery of the Prize to the Winner.\nand (c) any shipping and handling expenses related to the delivery of the Prize.</p>\n<p>3.9 Delivery of Prize.&nbsp;If you are a Sponsor, you must promptly deliver the Prize to the winner of your

with the Sweepstakes Rules for such Sweepstakes.\nYour participation in a Sweepstakes is subject to the applicable Sweepstakes Rules.</p>\n<p>3.11 Forfeiture of Prize.&nbsp;If you are a Winner and you are not available upon the awarding of the Prize, the Prize may be forfeited in accordance with the Sweepstakes Rules.</p>\n<p>3.12 Conflicts.&nbsp;If these Terms are inconsistent with or conflict with the Sweepstakes Rules, the Sweepstakes Rules prevail.</p>\n<p>3.13 Sponsor Responsibility for Legal Compliance.&nbsp;You agree that the Sponsor is solely responsible for ensuring that their Sweepstakes is compliant with all applicable laws, regulations, by-laws, rules, and orders in the jurisdictions in which the Sweepstakes is being made available.\nFor example, certain US states require that sweepstakes sponsors register sweepstakes in advance, post a form of financial security for offered prizes, and certify winners to the state.\nYou agree that Trufan.io, Twitch Interactive, Inc., YouTube LLC, Microsoft Corporation, Facebook, Inc., and Twitter, Inc.\nare not responsible or liable for any legal non-compliance by Sponsors, except where such entity is the Sponsor.</p>\n<p>3.14 Your Responsibility for Compliance.&nbsp;You agree that it is your responsibility to comply with all applicable terms of services, terms of use, rules, guidelines, or other contractual obligations when promoting a Sweepstakes on any third party website, social network, or other platform (\u201c<strong>Third Party Rules</strong>\u201d).\nFor example, when promoting a Sweepstakes on Twitch.tv, you must comply with section 8(d) of Twitch.tv\u2019s Terms of Service, which, among other things, requires that you display or read out loud the following statement when a Sweepstakes is on your Twitch.tv channel:</p>\n<p>\n<em>\u201cThis is a promotion by [Sponsor\u2019s name].\nTwitch does not sponsor or endorse [Sponsor\u2019s name\u2019s] promotion and is not responsible for this promotion.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>\n</p>\n<p>You agree that Trufan.io is not liable for any loss you suffer resulting from non-compliance with
