SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE MEANS OF RESOLVING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN US.\nYOU ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO BRING A CLAIM IN COURT OR IN FRONT OF A JURY (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AND THAT YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nWHILE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN COURT PROCEDURES, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD YOU INDIVIDUALLY THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED AND ENFORCED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF.\nTHE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS MANDATORY PROVISION, THEY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nTHEY FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COSTS OF LITIGATION AND THE RIGHT TO DISCOVERY MAY BE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN COURT.\nWe also both agree that:</b>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>Notice of Dispute.</b>&nbsp;If either you or we intend to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration.\nNotice to us should be sent either by mail to Verizon Media, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089.\nor disputes@verizonmedia.com.\nNotice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that we have in our records at the time the notice is sent.\nThe notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought.\nIf we are unable to resolve the Dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Arbitration Procedure.</b>&nbsp;The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms.\nExcept for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nThe AAA will apply the&nbsp;Commercial Arbitration Rules&nbsp;to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's&nbsp;Consumer Arbitration Rules&nbsp;will apply (excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions).\nYou can get procedures (including the process for beginning an arbitration), rules and fee information from the AAA&nbsp;(www.adr.org).\nThese Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Small Claims Court Option.</b>&nbsp;As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Arbitration Location.</b>Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Arbitration Fees and Expenses.</b>&nbsp;We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute.\nIf you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.\nIf the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Settlement Offers.</b>We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration.\nThe amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim.\nIf you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute.\nIf the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Severability.</b>&nbsp;If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s).\nHowever, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof.\nAny Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable.\nTo avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S.\nUSERS.</u>THESE TERMS DO NOT ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS, EVEN IF THE AAA PROCEDURES OR RULES WOULD.\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD MONEY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.\nARBITRATION OR COURT PROCEEDINGS HELD UNDER THESE TERMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT, MAINTAINED OR RESOLVED ON BEHALF OF OR BY A CLASS, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nIN ADDITION, INDIVIDUAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE COMBINED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL OF THE PARTIES.\nANY QUESTION REGARDING THE ENFORCEABILITY OR INTERPRETATION OF THIS PARAGRAPH WILL BE DECIDED BY A COURT AND NOT THE ARBITRATOR.</li>\n<li>\n<u>JURY TRIAL WAIVER FOR U.S.\nUSERS.</u>&nbsp;IF FOR ANY REASON A DISPUTE PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER

Privacy Notice</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice describes Verizon Media EMEA Limited's data processing practices regarding the collection and use of your personal data when using our OneSearch Services.\nThe notice also sets out your privacy rights and how to exercise those rights.\nIt applies to our consumer customers that use OneSearch, but doesn\u2019t apply to the information we hold about companies or organisations.\nThis Privacy Notice applies to individuals using the OneSearch Service who are located in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>\n<p>Please read this Privacy Notice carefully as it applies to the OneSearch Services we provide to you from the EMEA region.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Date of last update</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice was last updated on March 24, 2021.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes since the last version</strong>\n</p>\n<p>There has been no changes to the EMEA privacy policy since the launch of the Services.</p>\n<p>We may amend this Privacy Notice from time to time (see Section 10) and where these changes are material we will endeavour to give you reasonable notice of these changes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to read this Privacy Notice</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Technology is a fast changing area and can be complicated.\nTo help you understand our policy, we have included a glossary which explains the meaning of any technical terms we use.\nThroughout this policy we have highlighted in bold font key technical terms which we have included a definition for in the glossary.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Links to previous version of this privacy notice</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>February 22, 2020 version 1.0 - original version</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Who we are</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The OneSearch Services are operated by Verizon Media EMEA Limited (\u201cVerizon Media\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cour\u201d, or \u201cus\u201d), a registered company established under the laws of Ireland and located in 5-7 Point Square, North Wall Quay, Dublin 1, Ireland.\nVerizon Media EMEA Limited provides the OneSearch Service to you and is the <strong>Controller</strong> of the <strong>Personal Data</strong> processed when you use the OneSearch Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Which services are covered?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice applies only to the following OneSearch Services:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OneSearch search engine;</li>\n<li>OneSearch\u2019s website;</li>\n<li>OneSearch iOS and Android mobile applications.\nand</li>\n<li>OneSearch browser extension.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Privacy Notice describes to you, the user, our data processing practices for this Service (also referred to as the \u201cOneSearch Service\u201d, \u201cOneSearch Services\u201d or \u201cServices\u201d).\nIt informs you about the limited collection, transfer, <strong>Encryption</strong>, storage, and disclosure of your information for the purposes of providing this Service.</p>\n<p>Verizon Media is headquartered in Ireland and as such, the processing will be subject to European and Irish laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is not covered/under our control</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Notice only covers OneSearch Services that we control.\nThis Privacy Notice does not cover any collection and further processing of <strong>Personal Data</strong> by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any party (including Verizon Media) when you click on any link provided as a result of a search made with the OneSearch Services (e.g., when you access a URL provided in the search results <strong>Cookies</strong> may be dropped).</li>\n<li>Any third party who may access <strong>Personal Data </strong>that you make available when using the OneSearch Services (e.g., your internet service provider, the provider of your web browser or the provider of any browser extension you may be using to access the Services).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nGlossary</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This section explains the terms used within this Privacy Notice whose meaning may not be immediately obvious.\nWherever we have used these terms in the Privacy Notice we have <strong>Bolded</strong> and Capitalized them to indicate that a definition for them is provided in this section.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A<strong> Cookie</strong> is a packet of information sent by a server to a Web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses that server.\nFor example, they can be used to identify users and cache user preferences (such as but not limited to user selected graphics).</li>\n<li>The <strong>Controller</strong> is the entity who determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data is to be collected and processed.\nFor the One Search services, Verizon Media EMEA Limited is the <strong>Controller</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Encryption</strong> is the process of changing electronic information or signals into a secret code (known as a cipher) so that it cannot be read or deciphered by anyone who does not have the key used to create the cipher.\nThe method(s) of <strong>Encryption</strong> that OneSearch Services use are described through this link.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IP Address</strong> is a unique electronic address made up of a series of numbers which identifies the device or internet access point that you are using.\nIt is necessary in order to identify where information should be sent when a request over the Internet is made.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Location Data</strong> is information derived from your <strong>IP Address</strong> to determine your general location.\nWe only use <strong>Location Data</strong> to provide you with useful location specific search results.\nAlthough different levels of specificity of location can sometimes be inferred from <strong>IP Address</strong>es (e.g., country, state, city, zip code, house/office), we only infer <strong>Location Data</strong> at the city level of specificity unless you have specifically selected that we provide you with results to a zip code or similar, but still imprecise, level of specificity through the <strong>Set Location</strong>\n<strong>Functionality</strong>.\nWe do not collect <strong>Location Data</strong> that is more specific than within a 500 meter radius.\nIt is also worth noting that your search results may also be tailored towards a specific location if you have confirmed a <strong>Search Query </strong>which indicates a location within it (e.g., if you search \"Pizza Restaurants London\").</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong> is a general term to describe actions that we and our <strong>Search Provider</strong> take in order to protect users, our systems and the <strong>Search Provider's</strong> systems from harm and/or misuse.\nExamples of the types of harm and misuse that the <strong>Search Provider </strong>and we are looking to protect against are hacking attacks and fraudulent clicks.\nIt is necessary to use a non-encrypted version of a user's <strong>IP Address</strong> to complete this purpose.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Obfuscation</strong>, in relation to this Service, is a process of rendering an <strong>IP Address</strong> as no longer specific to a single device.\nFor example, if your IPv4 <strong>IP Address</strong> was 102.3.3.201, this could be obfuscated by dropping the last octet or byte of the address, making the <strong>IP Address</strong> 102.3.3.### (for example, 102.3.3.000).\nAfter <strong>Obfuscation</strong>, your <strong>Search Query</strong> is no longer connected to you through your <strong>IP Address.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Data</strong> means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cuser\u201d or \u201cdata subject\u201d).\nan identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Search Optimisation </strong>is a process whereby we work with our <strong>Search Partners</strong> to provide you with contextual advertisements and/or search results.\nAs part of the process of selecting what advertising to provide you <u>we do not</u> consider any of your previous search history or any other <strong>Personal Data</strong> that identifies you.\nRather, we only provide these contextual advertisements and/or search results based on <u>each individual search</u> that you perform.\nFor example, if you search for \u201cflower shops\u201d we may display an advertisement/search result for one or more flower shops.\nWe will sometimes provide your <strong>Search Query</strong> and/or your general location to certain <strong>Search Partners</strong> in order to provide you with advertisements/search results but the information they receive is never identifiable to you as we do not provide your <strong>IP Address</strong> to any <strong>Search Partners</strong> (unless you identify yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong>, for example by inputting your name or entering your home address).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Search Provider</strong> is our third party that provides results in response to your <strong>Search Query</strong>.\nThey are not provided with your <strong>Personal Data </strong>unless you identify yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or click on a sponsored search result through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> (e.g., by inputting your name or entering your home address).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Search Partners</strong> are our third-parties that provide advertising, content, and additional search results.\nThey are not provided with your <strong>Personal Data</strong> unless you identify yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or click on sponsored content through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> (e.g., by inputting your name or entering your home address).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Search Query</strong> are the characters that you input into OneSearch (e.g., by entering text into the search field or selecting a suggested term of interest).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Search Stack</strong> is a general term we use to describe the internal systems used to provide the OneSearch Service.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> is the optional ability you have to select a more specific or different location for which you would like your search results to automatically be tailored.\nYou may choose a city location or you may choose a zip code or similar, but still imprecise, level of specificity.\nWe do not collect <strong>Location Data</strong> that is more specific than within a 500 meter radius.\nThe location you selected does not have to relate to your actual location (e.g., you may wish to search for restaurants in an area you will be travelling to soon).\nThis functionality resets each time you close a OneSearch browser session (i.e., your location selection will not be remembered the next time you use OneSearch).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>User Agent</strong> is the term we use for data about the software and hardware that is being used when a user makes a search.\nFor example, this can include data about the browser, operating system, type of computer and/or app that is being used to make a search.\nThe collection of this data is necessary to properly provide the service to different types of software and hardware being used (e.g., so that search results are provided on a mobile phone friendly interface when a search comes from a mobile phone) and for <strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong> purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nWhat Data Do We Collect, How We Use It and Why We Do This</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In this section we describe what <strong>Personal Data</strong> we collect, why we collect it and how we process it.\nWhen you make a search no <strong>Personal Data</strong> will be transferred to our <strong>Search Provider</strong> or any <strong>Search Partner</strong> unless you identify yourself or anyone else in the <strong>Search Query</strong>.</p>\n<p>When you input a <strong>Search Query</strong> into the OneSearch Service your <strong>IP Address</strong>, the <strong>Search Query</strong> and <strong>User Agent</strong> will be securely transferred from your browser to our <strong>Search Stack</strong>.</p>\n<p>We need to process your <strong>IP Address</strong>, <strong>User Agent</strong> and <strong>Search Query</strong> together to fulfil your search.\nWe derive your imprecise <strong>Location Data</strong> from your <strong>IP Address </strong>so that we can tailor the search results to you and your location.\nThe provision of this limited data is necessary to provide the OneSearch Service to you and if it is not provided we will not be able to perform the OneSearch Service.</p>\n<p>We will also process your location when you choose to give it to us using the<strong> Set Location Functionality</strong>.\nWe do this so that we can provide location specific search results (e.g., if you search \"flower shops\" then flower shops in your city or area may be provided in the results).</p>\n<p>When we fulfil a search request we will transfer your <strong>Obfuscated IP Address</strong>, <strong>Search Query</strong> and<strong> User Agent</strong> to our <strong>Search Provider</strong> to process.\nOur <strong>Search Provider</strong> is not able to link a <strong>Search Query </strong>back to you, as your <strong>IP Address</strong> is <strong>Obfuscated </strong>before we send it to them.</p>\n<p>We may also carry out <strong>Search Optimization</strong>, by including information from <strong>Search Partners </strong>who receive your <strong>Search Query</strong> and general geolocation.\nWe then provide search results to your browser so that you can see them.</p>\n<p>Very shortly (i.e., within seconds) after a <strong>Search Query</strong> has been completed, we will store your <strong>IP Address</strong>, <strong>Search Query</strong> and <strong>User Agent</strong> in different servers in such a way that they should not be capable of being connected.\nFrom that point we are not able to tell what <strong>IP Address</strong> any <strong>Search Query</strong> has come from.\nThe only <strong>Personal Data</strong> which we then hold about you is your <strong>IP Address, </strong>unless you have identified yourself in the <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> (e.g., by inputting your name or home address).</p>\n<p>When you make a search we also process your <strong>IP Address</strong> for the purpose of <strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong>.\nWe continue to store and process your <strong>IP Address</strong> for this purpose for four days.\nAfter this we permanently delete your <strong>IP Address</strong>.\nAny <strong>Personal Data</strong> provided through a <strong>Search Query</strong> or through the <strong>Set Location Functionality</strong> may be stored for a longer period, in accordance with general retention criteria for those functions.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Search Provider</strong> stores the <strong>User Agent</strong>, <strong>Search Query</strong>, and <strong>Obfuscated</strong>\n<strong>IP Address</strong> information we send to them for a period of time.\nIf you click on a sponsored search result (identified as an ad), the <strong>Search Provider</strong> will collect your <strong>IP Address</strong>.\nSimilarly, if you click on sponsored content from a <strong>Search Partner</strong>, the <strong>Search Partner</strong> may collect your <strong>IP Address</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nLegal basis for processing your Personal Data </strong>\n</p>\n<p>To provide the OneSearch Service, VME processes your <strong>Personal Data</strong> (i.e., the limited <strong>Personal Data</strong> points mentioned above) to conduct the following processing operations, for the following purposes and associated legal bases.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Purposes and Sets of Processing Operations</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Legal Bases</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide you with the OneSearch Services we:<br>\n<br> - Process your <strong>Search Queries</strong> to provide you with matching or relevant search results.\nand<br>\n<br> -&nbsp.\nCheck your <strong>IP Address </strong>and related location signals to understand where you are located to identify and provide you with relevant search results.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Necessary to perform the contract with the user.</li>\n<li>Verizon Media\u2019s and the User\u2019s legitimate interests, in delivering/receiving high quality search results when receiving / providing the service.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>For security purposes, including to detect and defend against fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity we:<br>\n<br> -&nbsp.\nCheck your <strong>IP Address</strong> and related location signals to look for anomalous events which might undermine or threaten our Services (e.g., <strong>Network Traffic Protection</strong>).\nand<br>\n<br> -&nbsp.\nAccess, preserve, and share data with government agencies and third parties to protect you and the general public, prevent infringement of our&nbsp;Terms&nbsp;or violations of third parties\u2019 rights and to assist in the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, or other unlawful activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verizon Media\u2019s and User\u2019s legitimate interests in carrying out these activities to keep the services safe and secure.</li>\n<li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nEncryption and short term storage of browser history</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you click the search button, the URL of the webpage that comes up on your browser with your search results will be encrypted so the term(s) you have searched for will not be found in, or identifiable from, the URL.\nCertain of the information contained in the URL relates to a Where on Earth ID which is a numerical value that can be associated with a generalised geolocation relating to the target location of your search.\nThis URL expires after an hour, eliminating your search history.\nFurther information about this part of the Service, and the <strong>Encryption</strong> used, can be found here<u>.\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>The retention periods of the limited types of data which we collect stemming from your use of the OneSearch Service are set out below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Type of Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>OneSearch Retention Period</strong>\n</p>\n<p>IP Address</p>\n<p>4 days</p>\n<p>Search Query</p>\n<p>180 days</p>\n<p>User Agent</p>\n<p>180 days</p>\n<p>Location Data</p>\n<p>180 days</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nWith whom we share your Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except as necessary to provide the Services, we never share <strong>Personal Data</strong> we receive from you unless: (a) we have your separate and explicit permission to share that information.\nor (b) we have given you prior notice that the information will be shared, and with whom (such as in this Privacy Notice).</p>\n<p>Legal Obligations and Terms of Service Enforcement: We reserve the right to access, preserve and disclose any <strong>Personal Data</strong> to investigate, prevent, or take action in connection with legal process and legal requests, and for enforcement of the Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>We share data with our service providers (sometimes referred to as \u201cprocessors\u201d) that work on our behalf and process your data solely at our direction.\nThe following service providers help us provide the OneSearch Service:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our US affiliates including Oath Inc., Oath Holdings Inc., and Oath (Americas) Inc., who provide infrastructural, security and technical support to enable us to provide the OneSearch Service;</li>\n<li>Our <strong>Search Provider</strong>, Microsoft, who provides relevant search results, advertising, and content in response to a user\u2019s Search Query, which is required to operate the OneSearch Service.\nand</li>\n<li>Our <strong>Search Partners</strong> who provide <strong>Search Optimisation </strong>services which provides you with contextual advertisements and/or search results.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you enter <strong>Personal Data </strong>or location information like your address in the <strong>Search Query</strong> it will be shared with these service providers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nHow do we protect your data?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We have implemented the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security in relation to your <strong>Personal Data</strong> that is appropriate to any risk associated with it.</p>\n<p>Your <strong>Personal Data</strong> is processed and stored in servers that are located in Ireland and the USA, (see Section 9 below).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nHow to exercise your rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), you have certain privacy rights.\nIn particular, if you are a resident in the European Union, you have the right to information, access, restriction or correction of your <strong>Personal Data</strong>.\nIn addition, you may request data portability, or in certain circumstances, object to the processing of your data or request deletion of your data.\nIf you wish to exercise any of these rights, you can do so at any time by contacting us through the methods described in Section 11 (\u201cContact us\u201d) below.</p>\n<p>Given how OneSearch stores and retains data, users can exercise their rights under GDPR, but because VME do not keep any <strong>Personal Data</strong> (i.e., <strong>IP Address</strong>es) for longer than four days, there may be nothing to return to users and no <strong>Personal Data </strong>for users to request,
