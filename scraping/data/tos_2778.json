\"our\") uses cookies and similar technologies (like web beacons) when you visit any of our websites that link to this Cookie Policy (such as www.webflow.com) (\"Websites\").\n</p>\n<p>It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we may use cookies and similar technologies to collect Personal Information or information that becomes Personal Information if we combine it with other information.\nIn such cases, the Webflow Global Privacy Policy will also apply, as will the EU &amp.\nSwiss Privacy Policy, if applicable.</p>\n<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Policy have the meaning given them in our Webflow Global Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p> Hi there <p>Welcome to Webflow's Cookie Policy! <br>\n<br>If it was purely up to us, we'd made this policy all about giving out fresh-baked cookies every time you design something awesome in Webflow \u2013 but alas, we'll need to talk more about browsers than snickerdoodles in this particular policy.</p> What cookies are <p>A cookie is a small software file stored temporarily or placed on your computer\u2019s hard drive.\nThe main purpose of a cookie is to allow a web server to identify a user\u2019s computer and web browser and tailor web pages and/or login information to a user\u2019s preferences.\nCookies help us promptly display the information needed to use the capabilities on the Service and other information which we consider to be of interest to visitors to the Sites and users of the Service.\nBy gathering and remembering information about website preferences through cookies, we can provide a better web and marketing experience.\nCookies do not give us access to your computer.</p> Cookie (n) <p>\n<strong>1:</strong> a small flat or slightly raised cake</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2:</strong> a person of a specified kind<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2022 <em>a tough </em>\n<strong>\n<em>cookie</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3:</strong> a small file or part of a file stored on a World Wide Web user's computer, created and subsequently read by a website server, and containing personal information (such as a user identification code, customized preferences, or a record of pages visited)</p> The types of cookies Webflow uses <p>There are two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.\nWe use both session and persistent cookies.\nSession cookies allow us to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to process your online transactions.\nSession cookies disappear from your computer when the web browser is closed or computer is turned off.\nWe also utilize persistent cookies to make it easier to log into and use the Service.\nPersistent cookies remain on computers after the web browser is closed or the computer is turned off.</p> Basically...\n<p>We use session cookies, persistent cookies, and pecan sandies.\nThe names of two out of three of those are surprisingly clear.\n</p> Cookies on customer sites <p>We do not add any cookies to customer sites.\nThe cookies described in this Policy only apply to Webflow\u2019s own marketing and product pages, not websites that are created with Webflow or published via Webflow Hosting.\nCustomers may make changes to their websites at their own discretion that may cause cookies to be added (for example, enabling Google Analytics, using a Facebook Like button, or adding custom code), but these changes are optional and not made by Webflow.\n</p> Basically...\n<p>We'd love to give you all the tasty kind of cookies, but we don't put the tracking kind on the sites you create or host with Webflow.</p> Third-party cookies <p>Cookies set by us are called \"first-party cookies,\" while cookies set by others are called \"third-party cookies.\" A third-party cookie can recognize your device both when it visits our Services and when it visits certain other websites or mobile apps.\nWebflow does not control how third-party cookies are used, so you should check the website of a third-party cookie provider for more information about how they are used.\n</p>\n<p>Both first-party and third-party cookies can serve many functions, including analytics, marketing, and advertising.\nFor more information about how you can control advertising or analytics cookies, please see the relevant section below.\n</p>\n<p>We do not track or respond to browser \u201cDo Not Track\u201d requests.</p> Basically...\n<p>Third-party cookies are other people's cookies.\n</p> Cookies and your Personal Information <p>Some cookies are associated with your account and Personal Information, while others are not.\nWe generally treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non\u2011Personal information.\nHowever, to the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as Personal Information.\nIf we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, then the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p> Basically...\n<p>Some cookies are completely anonymous, while some may contain your personal information.\n</p> Why Webflow uses cookies and similar tracking technologies <p>Webflow uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enable functionality on its Services, and to assist with marketing its products and services to interested individuals.\nCookies help us improve by telling us our Services are being used, letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and overall ensuring you enjoy your browsing experience on our Services.\nThe chart below explains how we generally use cookies.\n</p> Category of use Description Authentication <p>These cookies help us show you the right information by personalizing the Services to your account.</p> Security <p>These cookies help us detect suspicious or malicious activity on our Services, and support other security features.</p> Preferences and functionality <p>These cookies allow our Services to recognize you and your preferences.\nFor example, they can auto-fill a form for you, provide you with customized content, remember your application settings, and more.</p> Advertising <p>These cookies allow us to show you advertising about Webflow on and off the Services.\nThey tell us whether you took an action after seeing one of our ads, such as signing up for a webinar or other event by Webflow.\nThey also let our advertising partners know how well our ads are doing by measuring the ad\u2019s success and the types of interactions people have with our ads.</p> Research, performance, and analytics <p>These cookies help us understand how well our Services are doing by measuring your interactions with our Services.\nWe use insights from these cookies to improve on current Services, and to research and develop new Services, features, or products.\nThey also help us use plugins on our Services that allow you to enjoy certain functions, such as sharing our pages on your social media accounts.</p> Managing first-party cookies with your browser settings <p>If you would like to control the first-party cookies on our Services, you can use your browser to enable, disable, or delete cookies.\nTo do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the \u201cHelp,\u201d \u201cTools,\u201d or \u201cEdit\u201d settings).\nHowever, please be aware that if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of the Services and other parts of the Services may also not work properly.</p>\n<p>Many browser manufacturers provide helpful information about cookie management, including, but not limited to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Safari (Desktop) or Safari (Mobile)</li>\n<li>Android Browser</li>\n<li>Opera </li>\n<li>Internet Explorer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use a different browser, please refer to your browser\u2019s documentation.\nYou can also find out more about how to change your browser cookie settings at www.allaboutcookies.org.</p> Basically...\n<p>Browsers give you a lot of control over cookies, and you can tweak your settings to disable cookies.\nHowever, disabling some cookies will make it impossible to log into Webflow and use it properly.</p> Advertising and/or analytics cookies Webflow uses and how to control them <p>We use third-party advertising and analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to share offers with individuals who may be interested in our Services.\nThe Services primarily use the following advertising and/or analytical tools, for which we include relevant privacy information and opt-out options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Google Analytics and Google Adwords\u200d<br>\u200d</strong>Google\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics is restricted by the&nbsp;Google Analytics Terms of Service&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Google Privacy Policy.\nYou may also&nbsp;learn more about how Google collects and processes data&nbsp;specifically in connection with Google Analytics.\nYou may prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics by downloading and installing the&nbsp;Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Amplitude<br>\u200d</strong>Amplitude\u2019s use of information collected is set forth in its Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Attribution<br>\n</strong>Attribution's use of information collected is set forth in its Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Iterable<br>\u200d</strong>Iterable's use of information collected is set forth in its Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Facebook Pixel and Remarketing Service<br>\u200d</strong>Facebook\u2019s use of information collected is set forth in its&nbsp;Privacy Policy.\nYou may&nbsp;opt out of Facebook\u2019s interest-based ads.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Segment<br>\u200d</strong>Segment\u2019s use of information collected is set forth in its&nbsp;Privacy Policy, which includes instructions for opt-out.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Disqus<br>\n</strong>Disqus outlines its use of information collected in its Privacy Policy.\nYou may also opt out of Disqus personalization features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you would like more information about cookies and targeted advertisements, please visit https://www.allaboutcookies.org.&nbsp;In addition, if you would like to opt out of interest-based targeting provided by participating ad servers, you may do so through the Digital Advertising Alliance (http://optout.aboutads.info/), the Network Advertising Initiative (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1), or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.youronlinechoices.eu).\nIn addition, on your iPhone, iPad or Android mobile device, you can change your device settings to control whether you see online interest-based ads.</p>\n<p>As described in our Privacy Policy, California consumers may use the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s tool to send requests under the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) for a web browser to opt out of the sale of personal information by some or all of that framework\u2019s participating companies by accessing the DAA\u2019s tool here: https://www.privacyrights.info/, or by downloading the DAA\u2019s AppChoices mobile application opt-out here:&nbsp.\nhttps://www.privacyrights.info/appchoices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The AppChoices app is not limited to opt-outs for CCPA purposes and may be used by anyone to limit the collection of cross-app data for interest-based advertising purposes by participating DAA member companies.</p>\n<p>If you are a California resident and would like us to no longer share your personal iin relation to cookies and related technologies, you can opt-out by visiting the following web page: <strong>Do Not Sell My Info</strong>\n<strong>.</strong>\n</p> Or...\n<p>How to Live Cookieless and Ensure All Ads You See Are Completely Irrelevant</p> Webflow's use of log files <p>Webflow gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files.\nThis information includes an anonymized internet protocol address as well as browser, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, search terms, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.\nOtherwise, we generally use this information as we would any Usage Data, to analyze trends, administer and maintain the Service, or track usage of various features within the Service.</p> Anyway...\n<p>Log as in record.\nNot Yule log.\n</p> Webflow's use of clear GIFs/web beacons <p>When you use the Service, we may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users.\nIn addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients.\nThe information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p> Anyway...\n<p>That's web b<em>e</em>acon, not bacon.\nMuch as we'd all prefer the latter.</p> Changes to Webflow's Cookie Policy <p>We may, in our sole discretion, modify or update this Policy from time to time.\nIf we make any material changes to this Policy, we will endeavor to notify you by email or by posting a prominent notice on the Sites prior to the change becoming effective, but will not be liable for any failure to do so.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.\nYour continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance to be bound by such changes to this Policy.\nYour only remedy, if you do not accept the terms of this Policy, is to discontinue use of the Service.</p> Basically...\n<p>If we change this policy, we'll let you know by cookiegram.</p> Contact us <p>If you have questions regarding this Policy or about the privacy practices of Webflow,

the Service in accordance with data-protection laws in the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland (collectively the \u201cData Protection Laws\u201d).\nAny discussion of your use of the Service in this Policy is meant to include your visits and other interactions with the Sites and Services, whether or not you are a user of Webflow\u2019s SaaS product.\n</p>\n<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in

do not agree with or you are not comfortable with any aspect of this Policy, our Global Policy or the Terms of Service, you should immediately discontinue access or use of our Services.\nIn the event

In these boxes, you\u2019ll find our plain-English version of the policy.\nIt isn\u2019t legally binding, so please use this it only as an aid.</p>\n<p>This version of our Privacy Policy covers how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the data of those in the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.\nIt takes precedence over the Global Privacy

shouldn\u2019t use our service.</p> 1.\nOur relationship to you <p>In order for you to understand Webflow\u2019s data protection obligations and your rights to your Personal Information under this Policy, it is important that you identify which relationship(s) you have with Webflow.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A \u201cUser\u201d is an individual providing personal data to us via our website or other services, products or platforms, such as by signing up for our newsletter or making an account and posting on the Forums.\nWebflow is in a \u201cdata controller\u201d relationship with Users.</li>\n<li>A \u201cCustomer\u201d is a specific type of User that has engaged us to act as an agent (or, as a \u201cData Processor\u201d) by obtaining our Services.\nWebflow is in a \u201cdata processor\u201d relationship with Customers.\n</li>\n<li>Webflow does not have a direct relationship with Customers\u2019 End Users.\nA \u201cCustomer End User\u201d is an individual that provides their Personal Information to our Customers.\nWe do not control the purposes nor the means by which this Personal Information is collected, and we are not in a direct relationship with Customer End Users.\nFor details about how Personal Information about Customer End Users is handled, please review our Customers\u2019 privacy policies instead of this one, and contact them for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hereinafter we may refer to Customers and Users collectively as \u201cyou.\u201d </p> Basically...\n<p>This is the bit where we define our relationship to you.\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve given us some personal information, such as by subscribing to our newsletter or joining our forum, then you\u2019re a \u201cUser\u201d of Webflow and we\u2019re a \u201cData Controller\u201d of your account information, such as your name and email address.\n</p>\n<p>If you use Webflow, then you\u2019re a \u201cCustomer\u201d and Webflow is a \u201cData Processor\u201d for you.\n</p>\n<p>A \u201cCustomer End User\u201d is someone who provides their personal information to our Customers.\nWe have no direct relationship with them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note that these categories are not mutually exclusive \u2014 you might be all three!</p> 2.\nNotice <p>Webflow provides notice to you through posted privacy policies and may provide additional \"just-in-time\" disclosures about the data collection, use, and sharing practices of specific Services.\nThe Global Privacy Policy generally describes our privacy practices, while this Policy is specific to Users and Customers located in the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland while using our Services.\nThis Policy describes how we process Personal Information from the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland in accordance with Privacy Shield and applicable data protection law.\n</p>\n<p>As a data processor, Webflow is not able to provide notice to or obtain consent from Customer End Users.\nTo the extent required by law, Webflow supports Customers\u2019 data-protection compliance efforts, but it is up to the Customer to ensure the appropriate data protection safeguards are in place before processing Personal Information from Customer End Users.\n</p> Basically...\n<p>We use our privacy policies and other \u201cjust-in-time\u201d methods (like cookie notifications and popups) to let you know about how we gather, use, and share data.\n</p>\n<p>Obviously, we can\u2019t do that for the visitors of any websites you create and host on Webflow, so it\u2019s up to you/your clients to make sure you\u2019re informing your website visitors about how you\u2019re handling their data.</p> 3.\nCollection of Personal Information <p>As described in the Global Privacy Policy, Webflow collects various types of Personal Information about you while you are using the Services.\nInformation that is anonymized or aggregated is not \u201cPersonal Information.\u201d </p>\n<p>In general, we collect the

Google account).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Profile data: </strong>biographical information, avatar, portfolio of work, skills, and/or freelance availability.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Financial data:</strong>

authentication data, security questions, public social networking posts, user ID, click-stream data, and other data collected via cookies and similar technologies.\nPlease read our&nbsp;Cookie Policy&nbsp;for more information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any information that is disclosed in the forums or our blog becomes public information.\nThis means that your posts are available to the public and may appear in search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be \u201ccrawled\u201d or searched by third parties.\nYour public posts can also be read, collected, or used by others to send you unsolicited messages.\nBe careful when posting on public parts of our Services and do not post any information that you are not comfortable sharing publicly.\n</p> Basically...\n<p>We collect various kinds of personal information while you\u2019re using Webflow, and all of that data is protected by the policies outlined here.\nAnonymized info is, naturally, not considered personal.\n</p>\n<p>Any info you post or share on our blog or forum becomes public and crawlable by search engines and other bots, because that\u2019s how the internet works.</p> 4.\nPurposes of

authorization.\nHowever, if you limit the way we use your Personal Information, certain features or Services may not be available to you.</p> Basically...\n<p>We have to let you know why we\u2019re processing your personal info, and the legal basis for doing so.\nWe may process your info: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>With your consent</li>\n<li>To satisfy legal obligations</li>\n<li>If we need to, to fulfill a contract with you, or to enter into a contract with you</li>\n<li>In the public interest</li>\n<li>In your vital interests</li>\n<li>Based on our legitimate interests</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we want to share your info with third parties not listed here or in our Global Privacy Policy, we\u2019ll ask your permission when required by law.\nYou may opt out of such sharing, but it\u2019s possible that will limit your use of Webflow.</p> 5.\nThird party sources of information <p>We only collect Personal Information about you from third parties that you voluntarily choose to connect with our Services.\nFor example, you can share Personal Information with us when you access our Site or Service through a third-party connection, or when you log in or connect an application to Webflow.\nWe process this information for the purposes of performance of our contracts with you.\nFor more information, please see Section 2(c) of the Global Privacy Policy.\n</p> Basically...\n<p>We only collect your personal information from third parties that you choose to connect with Webflow, such as Google, if you choose to sign in with Google.</p> 6.\nThird party recipients <p>Webflow conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide you with the Services.\nHowever, we do engage third-party service providers to assist with supporting our Services, including vendors in the following areas: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credit card or payment processors</li>\n<li>Cloud storage providers</li>\n<li>Customer support tools</li>\n<li>Product development tools</li>\n<li>IT and security service providers, and</li>\n<li>Marketing or analytics tools </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each service provider is vetted and bound by contractual obligations that are equivalent to the provision of this Policy or more stringent.\nSee the \u201cAccountability for Onward Transfers\u201d section below for more information about our agreements with third parties.</p> Basically...\n<p>We handle most of the data processing required for you to use Webflow ourselves, but we do use a few third-party services to handle things like payments, file storage, and analytics.\nAll those services abide by policies like ours.\nMore on that in the \u201cAccountability for onward transfers\u201d section below.</p> 7.\nRetention <p>We are committed to keeping your Personal Information secure on our Services.\nWe limit our storage of your Personal Information to the amount of time necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected the Personal Information, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations, or to resolve disputes.\nAlthough retention laws and requirements vary by jurisdiction, we have some standard retention periods for parts of your Personal Information which are described below: &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact information collected for marketing purposes, such as your name and email address, is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe from our marketing communications.\nThereafter we will add your contact information to our suppression list indefinitely to respect your unsubscribe request.</li>\n<li>Browser interaction data, such as cookies and trackers, is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie or date of collection.</li>\n<li>Product analytics data is kept for up to 5 years, and automatically deleted on an ongoing basis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have questions about retention periods that apply to any other data, please contact us at&nbsp;privacy@webflow.com.</p> Basically...\n<p>We\u2019re dedicated to keeping your personal info safe.\nThat\u2019s why we only store your data as long as it\u2019s necessary to fulfill the purpose it was collected for.\nThis varies by data type and jurisdiction, but two of the most important are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Your marketing contact info</strong>: which we keep for as long as you use the platform, or until you ask us to remove it</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your interaction data</strong>: which we keep no longer than a year from the date of collection, or from the cookie\u2019s expiration date</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product usage data:&nbsp;</strong>which we keep for up to 5 years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u2018Cause nobody likes a stale cookie.</p> 8.\nInternational transfers <p>Webflow uses approved data transfer mechanisms to transfer your Personal Information in and out of the United States and other jurisdictions.\nWe rely on European Commission\u2013approved Standard Contractual Clauses as a legal mechanism where required for any data transfers from the U.S.\nto a country outside the UK, EU, EEA, or Switzerland to the extent that any such transfers occur.\n</p>\n<p>In relation to transfers of Personal Information to the U.S., Webflow receives Personal Information pursuant to Standard Contractual Clauses and other data transfer mechanisms.\nWebflow also has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework (hereinafter, the \u201cFramework\u201d or \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d) as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of Personal Information transferred from the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland to the United States.\nWe recognize that the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that a certification under the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework no longer can serve as the basis by which entities subject to the GDPR export Personal Information to countries whose laws have not been recognized by the European Commission as providing a high level of protection for the information.\n&nbsp;As affected customers who relied only on our Privacy Shield certification transition to the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and other methods for transferring Personal Information to Webflow under the GDPR, Webflow will continue to honor our obligation to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such information.</p>\n<p>This EU &amp.\nSwiss Privacy Policy and the Webflow Global Privacy Policy describe Webflow\u2019s privacy practices.\nIn the event there is a conflict between the terms in the Global Privacy Policy and this Policy, this Policy shall govern for any conflicts related to UK, EU, EEA, or Swiss data subjects.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p> Basically...\n<p>We welcome the use of Standard Contractual Clauses and other approved data transfer mechanisms to transfer your personal data between jurisdictions.</p> 9.\nAccountability for onward transfer <p>Webflow complies with the Privacy Shield Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the UK, EU, EEA, and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.\nWebflow contractually obligates third-party agents or service providers to provide the same level of protection as required by the Privacy Shield Framework and under the Data Protection Laws.\nIn addition, we limit and specify the purpose(s) for processing your Personal Information consistent with any notice provided to you and your consent.\n</p>\n<p>Upon request by the United States Department of Commerce, Webflow will provide a summary or representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of its agreement with a third-party agent.</p>\n<p>In certain situations, Webflow may be required to disclose your Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, to comply with a judicial proceeding or court order, or as otherwise required by law.</p> Basically...\n<p>We use contractual protections and other safeguards when it comes to transferring your personal information to the United States, and require that third parties we work with do so as well.</p> 10.\nSecurity <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information by using reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards.\nPlease refer to Section 6 of the Global Privacy Policy for more detailed information about our security safeguards.</p> Basically...\n<p>We care about the security of your personal info.\nYou can read more about our safeguards in section 6 of our Global Privacy Policy.</p> 11.\nDirect marketing <p>Direct marketing includes any communications to you that are only based on advertising or promoting products and services.\nTransactional communications about your account or our Services are not considered \u201cdirect marketing\u201d communications.\n</p>\n<p>We will only contact Customers by electronic means (including email) based on our legitimate interests or the Customer\u2019s consent.\nWhen we rely on legitimate interest, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.\n</p>\n<p>If you do not want us to use your Personal Information in this way, or to pass your Personal Information on to third parties for marketing purposes, please go to the email settings for your account to opt out, click an unsubscribe link in your emails, or contact us at privacy@webflow.com.\nYou can object to direct marketing at any time and free of charge.</p> Basically...\n<p>Any communications that promote our product and/or services are considered \u201cdirect marketing.\u201d If you\u2019re a customer of ours, we\u2019ll only send you direct marketing that\u2019s related to your use of Webflow, unless you consent to receive other types of communications.\nIf you\u2019re not a customer, we will only send you marketing communications you consent to.\nYou can always unsubscribe from your account email settings or by clicking the unsubscribe link in our emails.</p> 12.\nYour rights <p>You have the rights to your Personal Information that are described below.\nYou can exercise your

activities to which you object, and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for our processing.\nYour right to erasure is subject to limitations by relevant Data Protection Laws.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to data portability.</strong> If we process your Personal Information based on a contract with you or based on your consent, or the processing is carried out by automated means, you may request to receive your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your Personal Information directly to another data controller, where technically feasible, unless exercise of this right adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to restriction of processing.</strong> You have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Information where one of the following applies:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>You contest the accuracy of your Personal Information that we

the erasure of your Personal Information and request the restriction of its use instead.\n</li>\n<li>We no longer need your Personal Information for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by you to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>\n<li>You have objected to processing, pending the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of Webflow\u2019s processing override your rights.\n<br>\n<br>Restricted Personal Information shall only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.\nWe will inform you if the restriction is lifted.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Notification of erasure, rectification, and restriction.\n</strong>We will communicate any rectification or erasure of your Personal Information or restriction of processing to each recipient to whom your Personal Information has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.\nWe will inform you about those recipients if you request this information.\nIf we have made your Personal Information public and we are required to erase the Personal Information, we will, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other parties that are processing your Personal Information that you have requested the erasure of any links to, or copy or replication of your Personal Information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Right to object to processing</strong>.\nWhere the processing of your Personal Information is based on consent, contract, or legitimate interests, you may restrict or object, at any time, to the processing of your Personal Information as permitted by applicable law.\nWe can continue to process your Personal Information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling.</strong> You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated

negative impact on other's privacy</li>\n<li>Doing so protects our rights and properties, or</li>\n<li>Where the request is frivolous or vexatious</li>\n</ul> Basically...\n<p>Your rights to your personal information aren\u2019t unlimited, and may be denied under the listed conditions.</p> 14.\nRecourse, enforcement, &amp;&nbsp;liability <p>We will investigate and work expeditiously to resolve

modified\u201d date at the top of this page.\nYour continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.\nIf you do not agree to any of these

notifications we send to the email address you provide us.</p>\n<p>Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms

hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Webflow in our sole discretion.\nWebflow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing

Agreement (\u201cDispute\u201d), you and Webflow agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.\nSuch informal negotiations will commence upon written notice.\nYour address for such notices is your billing address, with an email copy to the email address you have provided to Webflow.\nWebflow\u2019s address for such notices is Webflow, Inc., 398 11th St., Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103.</p>\n<p>BINDING ARBITRATION.\nIf you and Webflow are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, all claims arising from use of the Service (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.\nAny election to arbitrate by one party will be final and binding on the other.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO ARBITRATE, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL.\nThe arbitration will be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) and, where appropriate, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (\u201cAAA Consumer Rules\u201d), both of which are available at the AAA website&nbsp;www.adr.org.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be governed by the AAA Rules (and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules).\nIf your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, Webflow will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nThe arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.\nThe arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nThe arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Webflow may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>EXCEPTIONS TO ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION.\nEach party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court or to seek injunctive or other equitable relief on an individual basis in a federal or state court located within the Central District of California with respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party\u2019s intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>\n<p>WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BE A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nYou and Webflow agree that any arbitration will be limited to the Dispute between Webflow and you individually.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Webflow ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Webflow otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d Section will be deemed null and void.</p>\n<p>LOCATION OF ARBITRATION.\nArbitration will take place in San Francisco, California.\nYou and Webflow agree that for any Dispute not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, the California state and Federal courts located in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction and you and Webflow agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p> Basically...\n<p>We don\u2019t want to fight.\nIf something goes wrong, contact us and we'll negotiate the problem.\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, we will figure it out in arbitration in San Francisco.\n</p> 17.\nMiscellaneous a.\nAssignment <p>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Webflow without restriction.\nAny attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p> b.\nGoverning law, international use, and users <p>The Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.\nYou agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and federal courts in San Francisco County, California, and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue.</p>\n<p>The Service is controlled and operated from its facilities in the United States.\nAlthough the Service may be accessible worldwide, we make no representation that the Service or the materials on the Service are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing the Service from territories where its use is illegal is prohibited.\nThose who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.\nYou may not use the Service if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government.\nUnless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Service are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the United States.</p> c.\nEntire agreement/severability <p>The Terms of Service represent the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the subject matter addressed herein and supersedes all prior to contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral.\nThe Terms of Service shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and lawful assigns.</p> d.\nNo waiver <p>Any failure by us to enforce or exercise any provisions of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.\nOur failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our rights to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p> e.\nAttorneys\u2019 and accountants\u2019 fees, remedies <p>In any action to enforce the Terms of Service, the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorneys\u2019 and accountants\u2019 fees and costs.</p>\n<p>You agree that Webflow's remedy at law for any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement would be inadequate and that Webflow shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief, or both, in addition to any damages that Webflow may be legally entitled to recover, together with reasonable expenses of any form of dispute resolution, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>No right or remedy of Webflow shall be exclusive of any other, whether at law or in equity, including without limitation damages injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, and expenses.</p>\n<p>No instance of waiver by Webflow of its rights or remedies under these terms and conditions shall imply any obligation to grant any similar, future, or other waiver.</p> Basically...\n<p>Don\u2019t transfer this agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These terms of service are governed by California law and are final.</p>
