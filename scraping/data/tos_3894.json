that end, SelfDecode provides the SelfDecode Platform, which features personalized information and a number of SelfDecode Products that can give you insights about yourself based on your genetics.\nSome of them also offer you services based on those insights.\nThere are many types of SelfDecode Products on the SelfDecode Platform.\nEach type can give you certain kinds of insights.\nSelfDecode also provides SelfDecode Insights.\nYou can access these insights as part of your SelfDecode Account and subscription.</p>\n<p>You can use the SelfDecode Platform to read personalized information or browse and buy SelfDecode Products.\nOver time, new SelfDecode Products will be added to the SelfDecode Platform.\nYou can buy as many (or as few) of these products as you want.\nBefore you buy a product, you\u2019ll be informed what you can expect to learn from it.\nYou\u2019ll also learn what information we will use to create it.</p> Using the SelfDecode Platform <p>\u2013 Providing your genetic file</p>\n<p>To use the SelfDecode Platform, you must upload your genetic file.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Getting insights from SelfDecode Products</p>\n<p>You choose the Products you want to use through the SelfDecode Platform.\nWhen you use a Product, you choose to learn about the portions of your Genetic Information that it needs.</p>\n<p>Each Product or Service you use will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use portions of your Genetic Information to offer you insights about yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tell you what you can expect to receive from the product.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask you to give your consent for that product to look at portions of your Genetic Information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask you to share some basic details about you, like your email address.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u2013 Getting your SelfDecode Insights</p>\n<p>If you opt in, SelfDecode will use certain portions of your uploaded sequenced DNA to produce your SelfDecode Insights.\nYou can then access your SelfDecode Insights through your SelfDecode Account.</p>\n<p>Your SelfDecode Insights may give you a glimpse into what Products could offer you, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you are more or less likely to have certain traits, like fast caffeine metabolism or being a night owl.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SelfDecode may also show you which product(s) in the SelfDecode Store take a deeper look at similar insights.</p>\n<p>SelfDecode may allow you to connect with other users to share and compare your SelfDecode Insights on the community platform for forum-based discussion .\nYou can only compare SelfDecode Insights with users with whom you agree to connect and who agree to connect with you.\nIf you choose not to connect with any other users, no other user will have access to your SelfDecode Insights.\nThis community platform may be canceled at any time.</p>\n<p>\u2013 Giving other information about you</p>\n<p>The SelfDecode Platform may also ask for your Self-Reported Information.\nThis information could improve your SelfDecode Insights.\nIn some cases, it could improve the insights you get from SelfDecode Products.\nIt could also support other tools and services through the SelfDecode Platform.</p>\n<p>\u2013 Helping improve the SelfDecode Platform</p>\n<p>SelfDecode may use your Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information as part of a pooled data set.\nWe call these data sets \u201cAggregated Genetic Information.\u201d This kind of data set combines de-identified data from many SelfDecode Users.\nThese data sets would not include any details that make it easy to identify you.\nSelfDecode may use these data sets for business or promotional purposes.\nTo use the SelfDecode Platform, you must let SelfDecode use your information as part of these data sets.</p>\n<p>SelfDecode strives to give you current, reliable, and high-quality experiences.\nAs such, a key way that we will use Aggregated Genetic Information is to improve the SelfDecode Platform.\nWe may do so with our quality control methods.\nSome of them may focus on how we store and process your Genetic Information.\nSome of them may focus on how you use the SelfDecode Platform.\nAll information used for quality control will be used only within SelfDecode.</p>\n<p>You can find more details about how we use Aggregated Genetic Information in our Privacy Policy.</p> Closing your SelfDecode Account <p>You can stop using the SelfDecode Platform at any time.\nYou can also choose to close your SelfDecode Account.\nMore details about this can be found in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\nIf you close your SelfDecode Account, neither you nor we can access your information on SelfDecode moving forward.\nClosing your SelfDecode Account prevents you from buying any more SelfDecode Products and removes access to your SelfDecode Insights.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We cannot restore your account if you close it.\nIf you wish to buy new SelfDecode Products or access the SelfDecode Platform, you will need to create a new SelfDecode Account.\nTo do so, you will also need to upload your genetic file again.\nWhen you close your account, we will archive your information.\nWe will keep it archived for as long as we must to meet our legal and regulatory requirements.</p> Benefits <p>We intend for you to benefit from the SelfDecode Platform.\nYou can do so by learning about yourself from your genetic file.\nWhat you learn may be useful for you in a number of ways.\nYou might assuage your curiosity or simply enjoy learning about your genetics.\nYou may also be able to apply what you learn to your health, wellness, family planning, and more.</p>\n<p>How you benefit may change as your interests, needs, and motivations change through your life.\nHow you benefit may also change as new SelfDecode Products and Insights are added to the SelfDecode Platform.\nYou may benefit in ways that we can\u2019t predict today.</p> Risks <p>There are some risks that come with using the SelfDecode Platform.</p>\n<p>There is a chance, you could learn something about yourself that you didn\u2019t want to know.\nFor instance, you could find out something that concerns you about your health.\nSince you share DNA with your blood relatives, these learnings could also affect them.\nYou may want to discuss your options with your doctor, a mental health professional, or a genetic counselor before or after you get your SelfDecode Insights.</p>\n<p>Under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, (GINA), no employer with at least fifteen workers can ask for your Genetic Information.\nNeither can any health insurer.\nHowever this does not apply to other groups, such as the US military or companies that offer life, long-term care, or disability insurance.\nSome states have safeguards for those types of insurance.\nYou should be aware of the laws in your state and be careful with whom you choose to share your Genetic Information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is a risk of a security event in which someone may access your data without your consent.\nThese data could include your name, contact details, or Genetic Information.\nWhen combined, these data could allow someone to connect your Genetic Information back to you.\nSelfDecode takes active steps to reduce the risk of such an event.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more details.</p>\n<p>SelfDecode may need to share details about you with regulators and law enforcement.\nThese details may include your Genetic Information.\nWe will only share these details if we are compelled by law to do so.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more details.</p>\n<p>Lastly, each SelfDecode Product has its own risks, benefits, and limitations.\nThe SelfDecode Platform will give you some details about each SelfDecode Product.\nYou should carefully weigh the risks, benefits, and limitations of each product you choose to buy.\nYou may way want to talk with a genetic counselor.&nbsp;</p> Limitations <p>The SelfDecode Platform has some limitations.\nSome of these are unique to SelfDecode.\nSome are related to genetic interpretation in general.\nMany of these are also discussed in our Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>SelfDecode only stores your genotype file.\nSome of the DNA that your genotype file does not contain could be needed for certain insights.</p>\n<p>Your Genetic Information cannot tell you everything about yourself.\nYour genes are only a part of who you are.</p>\n<p>Most traits that your SelfDecode Insights or SelfDecode Products describe are not deterministic.\nIn other words, your results describe your chance of having a given trait, but they can only rarely predict whether you do for certain.\nIn some cases, factors like where and how you live can influence this chance more than your DNA.</p>\n<p>SelfDecode Insights describe traits that have been studied mostly in people of European descent.\nAs such, SelfDecode Insights for users from other backgrounds may be less informative.\nSelfDecode Products may or may not base their results on science that looked at more diverse groups of people.</p>\n<p>Your SelfDecode Insights and Products are based on the current state of knowledge.\nOver time, more will be known about DNA and how it affects traits.\nAs this knowledge improves, we may update your SelfDecode Insights results.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Though not likely, your Genetic Information stored by SelfDecode could have some errors.\nIn some cases, errors can occur while sequencing your DNA prior to uploading tour genetic file onto our platform, or when we read the uploaded Genetic Information.\nSelfDecode has many quality control steps in place to find errors when they occur.</p>\n<p>In some cases, we may not be able to read your genetic file for technical reasons, such as not having the SNPs we read to provide you Insights.</p> Questions about the SelfDecode Platform <p>You may have questions about Selfdecode, the SelfDecode Platform, or your use of it.\nIf you do, you can contact SelfDecode\u2019s Customer Support at support@selfdecode.com.&nbsp;</p>\n",

DNA code of your genes (\u201cGenotype File\u201d).\nSelfDecode obtains these data from a genotype file that you upload.\nThe genotype file data and any interpretation of that data, are your \u201cGenetic Information.\u201d </li>\n<li>\n<u>SelfDecode Platform.</u> SelfDecode hosts a platform (the \u201cSelfDecode Platform\u201d) where you may receive insights about you from SelfDecode based on your Genetic Information (\u201cSelfDecode Insights\u201d), and purchase products and services that will use, interpret and deliver your Genetic Information (\u201cSelfDecode Products\u201d).\nSelfDecode Products are made by SelfDecode and use a portion of your Genetic Information to offer a specific SelfDecode Product or service to you.\nThe SelfDecode Platform provides you with tailored results based on the genotype file you choose to use.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>SelfDecode Account.</u> SelfDecode provides you access to a software platform via a https://selfdecode.com account (the \u201cSelfDecode Account\u201d).\nYour SelfDecode Account allows you to manage your Genetic Information, your SelfDecode Insights, the SelfDecode Products you purchased, and other account

giving you access to your Genetic Information.\nThis access can help you further your own self-discovery about your traits.\nBut before you subscribe to our Services, you should be aware of what genetics can and cannot tell you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SelfDecode is not engaged in the practice of medicine, and information learned through SelfDecode\u2019s services is not intended for diagnostic or medical use:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>SelfDecode\u2019s genetic testing services are not intended to be interpreted by users for the purposes of making any decisions regarding parentage or diagnostic or treatment.\nThe information you learn through our services does not constitute medical advice, and you should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of the provided genetic information.\nThe services are not intended to be used by the customer for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional medical advice.\nYou should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>BY USING SELFDECODE\u2019S GENETIC TESTING SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT USE ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SELFDECODE\u2019S SERVICE FOR DIAGNOSTIC OR HEALTH RELATED DECISION MAKING BEFORE SEEKING PROFESSIONAL ADVICE FROM A PHYSICIAN, GENETIC COUNSELOR, OR SIMILARLY QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL REGARDING ANY HEALTHCARE DECISIONS BASED ON GENETIC TESTING RESULTS PROVIDED BY SELFDECODE.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Rather, SelfDecode\u2019s services are for research, information, and educational use only.\nIn short, much of the health-related information learned from the provided genetic testing results have not been not clinically validated and the technology SelfDecode uses, although used in research, is not broadly used in healthcare settings.\nClinical validity refers to how well a specific genetic variant is related to the presence, absence, or risk of a specific disease or condition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SelfDecode encourages you to talk to a genetic counselor or a health professional prior to submitting a sample collection kit or to aid you in understanding your results.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In considering a purchase of the Services or any SelfDecode Product, you should be aware of certain risks and limitations of genetic interpretation.\nThese include the following:</p>\n<u>Genetics is an evolving field of study</u>\n<ul>\n<li>SelfDecode Products are based on the current knowledge of genetics.\nThis knowledge changes every day as we learn more through research.\nA SelfDecode Product based on the current state of knowledge may have a different interpretation in the future.</li>\n<li>Even though we know many traits have a basis in genetics, we may not know or understand all the genetic contributions for a trait.\nResearch in science and medicine is continuously discovering new links between genes and traits.\nSuch research is also showing that some previously identified links may not be valid.</li>\n<li>Every genome is different.\nEvery person has variations that are either unique to them or are not well described in medical and scientific literature.\nYour DNA will have variations that are not fully understood.\nAs such, some SelfDecode Products may reveal variations in your DNA that they cannot currently interpret.</li>\n<li>SelfDecode Products provide interpretations based on scientific studies.\nSuch studies are often based on a specific population, such as a specific ethnicity.\nThus, you may receive interpretations that are based on a population that differs from your ethnicity or genetic background.</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Genetics cannot tell you everything about yourself</u>\n<ul>\n<li>There are few cases where a single gene (or variation in a single gene) is completely predictive of any one trait.\nMost traits are influenced by multiple genetic and non-genetic factors.\nYour lifestyle, your environment and chance can also play a role in whether you will have or develop a trait.</li>\n<li>The interpretation of Genetic Information is often as a probability, likelihood, or risk.\nEven if you have one or more genetic variations linked to a certain trait, it may not mean that you have or will develop that trait.</li>\n<li>In addition to non-genetic factors, multiple genes or genetic variations often influence a single trait.\nThat means the effect of any one, single genetic variation may be low.</li>\n<li>Even if you do not have one or more genetic variations linked to a certain trait, you may still have or develop that trait.</li>\n<li>In some cases it is more accurate to measure your physical trait (e.g., height) than to use Genetic Information to predict the trait (e.g., genes for height).</li>\n</ul>\n<u>You may discover information that causes you distress</u>\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot unlearn the knowledge you gain from a SelfDecode Product.\nSome people prefer not to know their Genetic Information for some traits.</li>\n<li>You may discover Genetic Information that you do not expect.\nIn some cases this information may be interesting.\nIn other cases it may lead to unintended reactions such as anxiety, depression or distress.\nExamples of these include: <ul>\n<li>discovering an unexpected genetic risk for a health condition</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>SelfDecode allows you to select which insights you would like to receive by purchasing SelfDecode Products and navigating the platform.\nYou are responsible for considering the potential impact this information may have on you or your relatives before purchasing a SelfDecode Product.</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Revealing your Genetic Information may affect your privacy</u>\n<ul>\n<li>You may also wish to publicly share results on your own.</li>\n<li>You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others and know the consequences before doing so.</li>\n<li>Genetic Information that you choose to share with your health professional may become part of your medical record.\nThat means it could be accessible to other health professionals and possibly health insurance providers in the future.</li>\n<li>Please see our Privacy Policy for further information about how we handle your Genetic Information and your options for disclosure of such information.\nOur Privacy Policy describes how SelfDecode protects your privacy, and our Platform Consent describes the risks and benefits of genetic interpretation.</li>\n</ul>\n<u>Your Genetic Interpretation may have implications for your relatives</u>\n<ul>\n<li>Your biological relatives will share some portions of your DNA.\nBecause of this fact, some information you receive from SelfDecode Products you use may have implications for them as well.</li>\n<li>Genetic Information can reveal information that is surprising to you or your family.\nFor some SelfDecode Products, information may show that other relatives are at risk for a health condition they did not know about before.</li>\n<li>It is important to consider how information you learn may have a positive or negative impact on members of your family.\nSome of your family members may not want to know about such Genetic Information.</li>\n<li>If you have questions about how to share sensitive Genetic Information with relatives, you should speak with a qualified healthcare provider, such as a genetic counselor.</li>\n</ul>\n<u>You may receive information about your health</u>\n<ul>\n<li>SelfDecode Products analyze your Genetic information for Health purposes, and may suggest actions or interventions that you can take related to your health.\nHowever, SelfDecode Products do not have a complete view of your health history.\nBefore you act on any health information provided through SelfDecode Products, please first consult with a healthcare professional.</li>\n<li>Not all Genetic Information can or should be acted upon.\nIf you have questions or concerns, you should speak with a health professional such as a physician or genetic counselor prior to purchasing a SelfDecode Product.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The results of SelfDecode Products should not be used to diagnose or treat and medical condition.\nYou should consult a qualified healthcare provider before you take medical action.</li>\n<li>Not all scientific and health interpretation claims have been validated by the scientific and/or medical community or the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d).\nHowever, not all SelfDecode Products on the SelfDecode Platform require approval by the FDA.</li>\n<li>SelfDecode does not provide allergy testing and none of our content should be interpreted as allergy testing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PLEASE CALL YOUR DOCTOR OR 911 IMMEDIATELY IF YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE A MEDICAL OR PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY.</p>\n<strong>15.\nDisclaimer of Warranties</strong>\n<p>SelfDecode makes its best efforts to provide accurate Genetic Interpretation and to offer SelfDecode Products of high
