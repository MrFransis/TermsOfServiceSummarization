review any question of law and/or the merits, insofar as such waiver may validly be made.\nThe parties shall not be deemed, however, to have waived any other right to challenge any award.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p> The parties agree that the arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to issue interim orders for provisional relief, including, but not limited to, orders for injunctive relief, attachment or other provisional remedy, as necessary to protect either party\u2019s name, proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how or any other proprietary right.\nThe parties agree that any interim order of the arbitrator(s) for any injunctive or other preliminary relief shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIn addition, nothing in the Terms shall be

provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Assignment.\nThe Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Glority without restriction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Survival.\nSections 6, 8(b), 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19,
