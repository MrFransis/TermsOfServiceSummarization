TERMS OF SERVICE (\u201cTERMS OF SERVICE\u201d) DESCRIBE THE TERMS THAT APPLY TO YOUR USE OF INTERNET-CONNECTED \u201cSMART\u201d VIZIO PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RELATED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE/EQUIPMENT, DOCUMENTS AND CONTENT.\nBY USING YOUR VIZIO PRODUCT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.\nALL REFERENCES IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE TO \u201cVIZIO\u201d MEAN VIZIO, INC., 39 TESLA, IRVINE CA 92618.</p>\n<p>BEFORE USING YOUR VIZIO PRODUCT, PLEASE READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DO NOT USE THE VIZIO PRODUCT AND, WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF THE DATE OF PURCHASE, RETURN IT FOR A REFUND TO THE AUTHORIZED RETAILER WHERE YOU PURCHASED IT.</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service contain a binding arbitration agreement and a class action waiver for United States residents.\nIf you live in the United States, the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver affect your rights under these Terms of Service.\nPlease read the text under the section titled \u201cBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents Only)\u201d carefully.</p>\nPrivacy Policy and Limited Warranty\n<p>VIZIO\u2019s Privacy Policy explains how VIZIO collects, uses, shares and protects VIZIO customer information.\nBy agreeing to these Terms of Service, you consent to VIZIO\u2019s collection, use, sharing and protection of your information as described in the Privacy Policy.\nPlease review the current version of the Privacy Policy at&nbsp;https://www.vizio.com/en/terms/privacy-policy.</p>\n<p>The Smart Products are also governed by the VIZIO Limited Warranty.\nPlease review the current version of the Limited Warranty at&nbsp;https://www.vizio.com/en/terms/warranty-and-returns.</p>\nPlatforms and Platform Services\n<p>The VIZIO Platforms, including the VIZIO Internet Apps\u00ae and VIZIO Internet Apps\u00ae Plus (\u201cVIA\u201d and \u201cVIA+\u201d) and the Google Cast Platform (collectively \u201cPlatforms\u201d), provide access to third party services (\u201cPlatform Services\u201d) on certain VIZIO televisions, displays and other internet-connected devices (each a \u201cSmart Product\u201d).\nVIZIO provides access to the Platform Services based on its agreements with those third parties.\nThese agreements are subject to change, interruption, suspension or termination at any time for various reasons.\nVIZIO makes no promises, warranties or representations that any particular Platform Service will be accessible, available, function in any particular manner, be error-free or function at all.</p>\nGoogle and Yahoo Terms\n<p>Your access to and use of the Platforms and Platform Services is subject to Google\u2019s (https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US), Youtube\u2019s (https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) &nbsp;and Yahoo\u2019s (https://policies.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/terms/index.htm) Terms of Service and Privacy Policies, as applicable.</p>\nInternet Access Is Required for Platform Services\n<p>To use the Platform Services, you must have or obtain access to high-speed internet, either directly or through devices that are internet accessible, and you are responsible for paying all internet-access service fees.\nAlso, you must provide all of the equipment necessary to connect to the internet, such as a modem.\nEach Platform Service may require a different minimum internet-connection speed.\nThe availability of a Smart Product\u2019s internet-connected features and functions may be highly dependent on your connection speed, bandwidth, other equipment, third party applications, firmware updates and other factors outside of VIZIO's control and responsibility.\nThese other factors may also operate independently of the operation of the Smart Product.</p>\nUpdates to the Platform Services\n<p>The Platform Services are constantly being improved.\nVIZIO may, or the third parties offering the Platform Services may, update or change the Platform Services, in whole or in part, at any time and without notice to you.\nThese updates may be required in order to use certain features or to continue to connect to certain Platform Services.\nThe Platforms may also be updated from time to time by VIZIO or its third party providers.</p>\nOther Changes to the Platform Services\n<p>VIZIO or the third parties providing the Platform Services reserve the right to (1) delete content from an application, (2) prevent access to the Platform Service(s), or (3) change content categories, products or service offerings for any reason at any time, without notice.\nVIZIO may also impose additional or different limits on use or access to certain Platform Services, without notice or incurring any liability to you.\nThe use, content or functionality of the Platform Service(s) may require additional payment and/or a subscription by you.\nHowever, you will not be charged for any Platform Services unless those charges are made known to you in advance.\nVIZIO makes no promises, warranties or representations of any kind as to the accuracy, availability or completeness of any information or content from the third party providers of the Platform Services.\nPlease note that VIZIO does not review, control or endorse any content, products or services provided as part of the Platform Services.</p>\nVIZIO Software\n<p>Unless governed by a separate license, the software, documentation and any fonts that accompany your Smart Product or are later downloaded or updated, in any media or in any other form (collectively \u201cVIZIO Software\u201d) are licensed, not sold, to you by VIZIO for use only as permitted by these Terms of Service.\nVIZIO reserves all rights to the VIZIO Software not expressly granted to you.\nThe rights granted herein are limited to VIZIO's and its third party providers' intellectual property rights in the VIZIO Software and do not include any other patents or intellectual property rights.\nYou may own the equipment or media on which the VIZIO Software resides but VIZIO and/or its licensor(s) retain ownership of the VIZIO Software.\nExcept to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, modify or create derivative works of the VIZIO Software or any part thereof.</p>\n<p>Through features found within your Smart Product, you may use the VIZIO Software and install upgrades subject to these Terms of Service.\nThe VIZIO Software may be used to access the Platform and Platform Services so long as such use is authorized and legally permitted.\nThese Terms of Service will govern any software upgrades provided by VIZIO that replace or supplement the original VIZIO Software, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern.\nTHE VIZIO SOFTWARE, PLATFORMS AND PLATFORM SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY EQUIPMENT OR ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE VIZIO SOFTWARE, PLATFORMS OR PLATFORM SERVICES COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE.</p>\n<p>You may not rent, lease, lend, redistribute or sublicense the VIZIO Software.\nYou may, however, make a one-time permanent transfer of all of your license rights to the VIZIO Software to another party, provided that: (a) the transfer must include the Smart Product, including all its component parts, original media, printed materials and these Terms of Service.\n(b) you do not retain any copies of the VIZIO Software, full or partial, including copies stored on a computer or other storage device.\nand (c) the party receiving the Smart Product and VIZIO Software reads and agrees to accept these Terms of Service.</p>\nExport Control\n<p>You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the VIZIO Software except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the VIZIO Software was obtained.\nIn particular, but without limitation, the VIZIO Software may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.\nembargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S.\nTreasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List.\nBy using the VIZIO Software, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.\nYou also agree that you will not use the Smart Products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.</p>\nSupport\n<p>VIZIO or its third party providers may elect, but shall be under no obligation, to provide you with customer support and/or software upgrades, enhancements, or modifications to the VIZIO Software, Platform or Platform Services (collectively, \u201cSupport\u201d), in their sole discretion, and may terminate such Support at any time without notice to you.\nVIZIO and its third party providers reserve the right to charge you for any Support.\nCharges will be made available to you prior to your incurring any costs.\nVIZIO may update the firmware of your Smart Product automatically at any time without notice to you.</p>\nWarranty Disclaimer\n<p>YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE PLATFORMS, PLATFORM SERVICES AND VIZIO SOFTWARE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU WITHOUT WARRANTY AS DESCRIBED BELOW, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nVIZIO AND VIZIO'S THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cVIZIO\u201d FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SECTION AND THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION BELOW) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PLATFORMS, PLATFORM SERVICES, AND VIZIO SOFTWARE.</p>\n<p>THE PLATFORMS, PLATFORM SERVICES AND VIZIO SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS,\u201d WITH ALL FAULTS AND \u201cAS AVAILABLE,\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE), TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\nUSE OF THE PLATFORM(S), PLATFORM SERVICES AND VIZIO SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.\nTHIS MEANS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT VIZIO DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE PLATFORMS, PLATFORMS SERVICES OR VIZIO SOFTWARE WILL ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY OR WILL WORK AT ALL, WILL BE ERROR-FREE, WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS.\nTHIS ALSO MEANS THAT VIZIO DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE PLATFORMS, PLATFORM SERVICES, OR VIZIO SOFTWARE WILL BE FREE FROM VIRUSES, HACKS OR OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL INTRUSIONS OR THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED.\nNO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY VIZIO OR A VIZIO AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW SUCH WARRANTY LIMITATIONS, SO THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nTHIS PROVISION WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE VIZIO LIMITED WARRANTY.</p>\nPlatform Services and Third Party Materials Disclaimer\n<p>Certain Platform Services and VIZIO Software may include third party materials or links to third party materials, such as applications, content or websites.\nVIZIO is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of the Platform Services or of any included or linked third party materials.\nVIZIO does not endorse any of the Platform Services or third party materials.\nVIZIO does not assume any responsibility for and will not have any liability for the Platform Services or any third party materials.\nLinks are provided solely as a convenience to you.\nDescriptions of the Platform Services are provided for general informational purposes, without any guarantee of accuracy.</p>\n<p>You understand that by using any of the Platform Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and such content may or may not be initially identified as being explicit.\nVIZIO shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not use any third party materials in a manner that would infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and VIZIO is not in any way responsible for any such use by you.</p>\nChanges to the Terms of Service\n<p>VIZIO may change the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service at any time without prior notice.\nBy continuing to use your Smart Product, you agree to the changed terms.\nThe current version of these Terms of Service will be available at&nbsp;https://www.vizio.com/en/terms.</p>\nTermination\n<p>These Terms of Service are effective until terminated or until you cease to use the Smart Product.\nYour rights under these Terms of Service will terminate automatically without notice from VIZIO if you fail to comply with any term(s) of these Terms of Service.\nUpon the termination of these Terms of Service, you must cease all use of the Smart Product, VIZIO Software, Platform and Platform Services.</p>\nLimitation of Liability\n<p>TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL VIZIO BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SMART PRODUCTS, VIZIO SOFTWARE, PLATFORMS OR PLATFORM SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF VIZIO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\nIn no event shall VIZIO's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00).\nThe foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.\nTHIS PROVISION WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE VIZIO LIMITED WARRANTY.</p>\nBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents Only)\n<p>UNLESS YOU HAVE BROUGHT AN ELIGIBLE CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR HAVE OPTED OUT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR VIZIO PRODUCT, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, ANY WARRANTY, THE COLLECTION, USE OR SHARING OF CUSTOMER OR VIEWING INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM A VIZIO PRODUCT, A BREACH OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, OR THE VIZIO PRODUCT\u2019S SALE, CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE, WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AND CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND ITS SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES.\nYou may learn more about the American Arbitration Association and its rules for arbitration by visiting www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.\nSince these Terms of Service concern a transaction in interstate or international commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply.</p>\n<p>The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared between you and VIZIO, but in no event will your fees ever exceed the amount allowable by the American Arbitration Association, at which point VIZIO will cover all additional administrative fees and expenses.\nVIZIO waives its right to recover attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with any arbitration under these Terms of Service.\nIf you are the prevailing party in an arbitration to which the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes applies, then you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees as the arbitrator may determine.</p>\n<p>The dispute will be governed by the laws of the state or territory in which you resided at the time of your purchase (if in the United States).\nThe place of arbitration will be Irvine, California, or your county of residence (if in the United States).\nThe arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute.\nThe arbitrator will not award consequential damages, and any award will be limited to monetary damages and will include no equitable relief, injunction, or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nExcept as may be required by law, neither you nor VIZIO nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration under these Terms of Service without the prior written consent of you and VIZIO.</p>\n<p>ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nVIZIO AND YOU AGREE THAT NO PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED AS A CLASS ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>\n<p>NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING.</p>\nExceptions to Binding Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver\n<p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, THEN: (1) you must notify VIZIO in writing within sixty (60) days of the date that you purchased the product.\n(2) your written notification must be mailed to VIZIO at 39 Tesla, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn: Legal Department.\nand (3) your written notification must include (a) your name, (b) your address, (c) the date you purchased the product, and (d) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver.</p>\n<p>In addition, you may pursue a claim in small claims court in your county of residence (if in the United States) or in Orange County, California.\nIn such case the provisions of the section titled \u201cBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents)\u201d will not apply.</p>\nAlternate Governing Law\n<p>If the foregoing section does not apply, these Terms of Service will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States, without reference to conflict of laws principles.</p>\nGeneral\n<p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and VIZIO with respect to your use of the VIZIO Software, Platforms and Platform Services made available hereunder and supersede all prior or contemporaneous understandings, with the exception of any additional Platform or Platform Services\u2019 licenses or terms and conditions that you are required to accept if you choose to access such Platform Services.\nIf any term of these Terms of Service, other than the class action waiver, is found to be unenforceable, that term will be severed from these Terms of Service and all other terms will remain in effect.\nIf the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire section titled \u201cBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents Only)\u201d will not apply.\nAny translation of these Terms of Service is done for local requirements and in the event of a dispute between the English and any non-English versions, the English version of these Terms of Service will govern.</p> Be

Service\n<p>You must obtain pre-authorization before sending your product to a VIZIO service center.\nYou may be required to supply a purchase receipt (or copy) to show that the product is within the warranty period.</p>\n<p>When you return a product to a VIZIO service center, you must ship the product in its original packaging or in packaging that affords an equal degree of protection.\nVIZIO Technical Support will provide instructions for packing and shipping the product to the VIZIO service center.</p>\n<p>ALL USER DATA AND DOWNLOADED APPLICATIONS STORED ON A PRODUCT WILL BE DELETED IN THE COURSE OF SOME IN-HOME AND ALL SHIP-IN WARRANTY SERVICE.\nIf this occurs, your product will be restored to its original state.\nYou will be responsible for restoring all applicable user data and downloaded applications.\nRecovery and reinstallation of user data and downloaded applications is not covered under this warranty.\nIn order to protect your personal information, VIZIO recommends that you always clear all personal information from the product before it is serviced, regardless of the servicer.</p>\nVIZIO\u2019s Responsibilities\n<p>If VIZIO determines that a product is covered by this warranty, VIZIO will (at its option) repair or replace it, or refund the purchase price to you.\nThere will be no charge for parts or labor during the warranty period.\nReplacement parts may be new or recertified at VIZIO\u2019s option and sole discretion.\nReplacement parts and VIZIO\u2019s labor are warranted for the remaining portion of the original warranty or for ninety (90) days from

this warranty, you may attempt to resolve the issue informally with VIZIO.\nIf you are unable to resolve the issue informally and wish to file a formal claim against VIZIO, and if you are a resident of the United States, you must submit your claim to binding arbitration according to the procedures described below, unless an exception applies.\nSubmitting a claim to binding arbitration means that you do not have the right to have your claim heard by a judge or jury.\nInstead your claim will be heard by a neutral arbitrator.</p>\nBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents Only)\n<p>UNLESS YOU HAVE BROUGHT AN ELIGIBLE CLAIM IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR HAVE OPTED OUT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR VIZIO PRODUCT, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS WARRANTY, A BREACH OF THIS WARRANTY, OR THE VIZIO PRODUCT\u2019S SALE, CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE, WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AND CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR APPOINTED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND ITS SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES.\nYou may learn more about the American Arbitration Association and its rules for arbitration by visiting www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879.\nSince this warranty concerns a transaction in interstate or international commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply.</p>\n<p>The filing fees to begin and carry out arbitration will be shared between you and VIZIO, but in no event will your fees ever exceed the amount allowable by the American Arbitration Association, at which point VIZIO will cover all additional administrative fees and expenses.\nVIZIO waives its right to recover attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with any arbitration under this warranty.\nIf you are the prevailing party in an arbitration to which the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes applies, then you are entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees as the arbitrator may determine.</p>\n<p>The dispute will be governed by the laws of the state or territory in which you resided at the time of your purchase (if in the United States).\nThe place of arbitration will be Irvine, California, or your county of residence (if in the United States).\nThe arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party's actual damages, except as may be required by statute.\nThe arbitrator will not award consequential damages, and any award will be limited to monetary damages and will include no equitable relief, injunction, or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\nExcept as may be required by law, neither you nor VIZIO nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this warranty without the prior written consent of you and VIZIO.</p>\n<p>ANY DISPUTE, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION, IN COURT, OR OTHERWISE, WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nVIZIO AND YOU AGREE THAT NO PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED AS A&nbsp;CLASS&nbsp;ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL&nbsp;ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>\n<p>NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE JOINED, CONSOLIDATED, OR COMBINED WITH ANOTHER ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING.</p>\nExceptions to Binding Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver\n<p>\n<b>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, THEN:</b>&nbsp;(1) you must notify VIZIO in writing within sixty (60) days of the date that you purchased the product.\n(2) your written notification must be mailed to VIZIO at 39 Tesla, Irvine, CA 92618, Attn: Legal Department.\nand (3) your written notification must include (a) your name, (b) your address, (c) the date you purchased the product, and (d) a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the binding arbitration agreement and class action waiver.</p>\n<p>In addition, you may pursue a claim in small claims court in your county of residence (if in the United States) or in Orange County, California.\nIn such case the provisions of the section titled \u201cBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents)\u201d will not apply.</p>\nExclusions and Limitations\n<p>TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THERE ARE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES OTHER THAN THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE.\nANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WILL BE LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE WARRANTY PERIOD SET FORTH ABOVE.\nSOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>VIZIO WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF INFORMATION OR DATA, COMMERCIAL LOSS, LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, OR OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF VIZIO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF THE REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\nSOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER REMEDY FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES AND DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING VIZIO\u2019S NEGLIGENCE, ALLEGED DAMAGE, OR DEFECTIVE GOODS, NO MATTER WHETHER SUCH DEFECTS ARE DISCOVERABLE OR LATENT), VIZIO MAY, AT ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OPTION AND IN ITS DISCRETION, REPAIR OR REPLACE YOUR PRODUCT, OR REFUND ITS PURCHASE PRICE.\nAS NOTED, SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\nHow the Law Applies\n<p>This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from state to state and province to province.\nThis warranty applies to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>\nGeneral\n<p>No employee or agent of VIZIO may modify this warranty.\nIf any term of this warranty, other than the class action waiver, is found to be unenforceable, that term will be severed from this warranty and all other terms will remain in effect.\nIf the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire section titled \u201cBinding Arbitration Agreement.\nClass Action Waiver (U.S.\nResidents Only)\u201d will not apply.\nThis warranty applies to the maximum extent not prohibited by law.</p>\nChanges to Warranty\n<p>This warranty may change without notice, but any change will not affect your original warranty.\nCheck&nbsp;www.vizio.com/en/home&nbsp;for the most current version.</p>\nReturn Policy for Direct VIZIO Sales\n<p>VIZIO's return policy allows for products

PRIVACY POLICY</b>\n<p>\n<b>Viewing Data -- Overview</b>\n</p>\n<p>Like many internet-connected TVs, VIZIO Smart TVs or other display units are equipped with Automated Content Recognition (ACR) technology that (when enabled) is able to use video and audio data to recognize what is playing on the TV and send information back to VIZIO about what is showing (\u201cViewing Data\u201d).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This feature was formerly called \u201cSmart Interactivity,\u201d but we are referring to the feature in our policies and settings today and in the future as&nbsp;<b>\u201cVIEWING DATA.\u201d</b>\n</li>\n<li>At any time, you may change your Viewing Data settings within the Settings menu of your VIZIO TV or display.\nTurning it off will not affect the performance of your VIZIO TV or display or any online services.</li>\n<li>Prior to collecting Viewing Data, each unit will receive (i) a notification, explaining the nature and purpose of the feature, separate and apart from this Privacy Policy and (ii) an opportunity to choose whether to turn on Viewing Data.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Viewing Data&nbsp;will only be collected from units that choose to \u201cACCEPT\u201d to collection and use of&nbsp;Viewing Data.\nThereafter, at that time, and any time after, you will have the option to change the setting for the&nbsp;ACR feature/Viewing Data&nbsp;collection off or on.\nDisabling&nbsp;Viewing Data&nbsp;will not, however, affect or limit Activity Data collection through the SmartCast Product.\nPlease review the Privacy Policy for further information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Privacy Policy may be modified from time to time as new features and functionality become available.</p>\n<p>\n<b>What is Viewing Data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>For VIZIO devices that have agreed to Viewing Data collection, VIZIO will use ACR technology to collect information about the audio and video programming content playing on the display unit including broadcast television, advertisements and other commercially available content (including volume, channel information, picture controls, and inputs), and other information, like when the device is off/on or if the content was viewed live or at a later time.\nVIZIO will also collect the identity of an Over the Top (OTT) device and third party services or applications, such as streaming service providers, (including stream and launch events for movies, TV shows, episodes and channels) that you connect to.\nVideo and audio analysis and data collection using ACR is referred to as \u201cViewing Data.\u201d</p>\n<p>Viewing Data is associated with the IP address for the unit and a unique device number we assign.\nHowever, VIZIO will combine and associated your Viewing Data with your myVIZIO account name if you create such an account or link to it to provide you with a more personalized experience on your SmartCast TV or display.</p>\n<p>The ACR software also periodically collects other information about the TV or display, including IP address and the media access control (\u201cMAC\u201d) addresses of available access points.\nViewing Data is maintained and used in an unidentified format, and VIZIO does not attempt to re-identify the data to associate it with individual customers and prohibits its authorized data partners from attempting to do so as well.</p>\n<p>At any time you may turn this ACR functionality on or off from the Settings menu of your VIZIO TV or display.\nTurning it off will not affect the performance of your VIZIO TV or display or any online services.\nFor specific instructions on how to turn off or on the ACR feature that collects Viewing Data, see the text below under the heading \u201cHow you can control the collection of Viewing Data.\"</p>\n<p>\n<b>How Is Viewing Data Used and Shared?</b>\n</p>\n<p>VIZIO associates Viewing Data with other data about the performance, settings, or features of particular VIZIO devices to support services and to help marketers deliver more relevant advertising.\nOur authorized cloud service providers, may store this data solely on our behalf and for no other purposes.&nbsp.\nWe may share Viewing Data with vendors, consultants and service providers who work on our behalf and make our business-to-business activities in digital advertising possible.</p>\n<p>VIZIO also licenses Viewing Data to analytics companies, media companies, advertisers, ad agencies, and other ad technology companies who measure ad effectiveness or aid personalization of ads, through written agreements which strictly prohibit attempts at identification or re-identification of shared information.\nViewing Data is used for the purposes listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Summary Analytics and Reports.</b>&nbsp;VIZIO\u2019s select data partners may analyze Viewing Data in order to create summary reports and analysis to help deliver relevant information and advertising to interested groups of customers.\nThese summary reports are built from automated analysis of data elements, without connecting the information to any known natural person.&nbsp.\nFor example, a data partner who is an advertiser may want to measure the effectiveness of their promotions, in the aggregate.&nbsp.\nThus, the&nbsp.\ndata partner may identify another device that shares an IP address with the VIZIO TV or display and analyze: (a) whether a particular website was viewed or commercial location was visited by a device with location tracking enabled (e.g., a smartphone) after a related promotion was viewed, and (b) whether a particular program was viewed following exposure to a promotion for that program.&nbsp.\nIn addition, some data partners are authorized to use a third-party data aggregator to identify demographic traits (such as gender or age range or income range) associated with the IP addresses that VIZIO collects, and then send to the data partners the demographic information associated with those IP addresses.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Audience Measurement.</b>&nbsp;VIZIO and these select data partners also use Viewing Data to understand what customers watch in order to deliver more relevant content and advertising, for example, by determining which programs are most popular, how many people watch a program to its conclusion, and whether and how often people are watching commercials.\nVIZIO and these select data partners may also combine Viewing Data with other demographic and similar information, including by working with data aggregators.</li>\n<li>\n<b>Tailored Advertisements.</b>&nbsp;VIZIO also licenses Viewing Data to select data partners for the purpose of targeting advertising to other digital devices that share the IP address of VIZIO TVs, based on viewing history collected from that TV.\nVIZIO or its data partners are sometimes authorized to enhance Viewing Data with household demographic data and data about digital actions (e.g.\ndigital purchases, location, and other consumer behavior taken by devices associated with the IP Address we collect), for the purpose of delivering advertising that are likely to be useful or timely, including during broadcast, cable, satellite, or internet based television programming.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>VIZIO does not permit data partners to combine or associate the Viewing Data with Personal Information.\nVIZIO may combine information (including Activity Data or Viewing Data) collected with other information so that VIZIO can provide, market, and improve VIZIO\u2019s products and services \u2013 such as by enhancing popular product functionality and by modifying services to better meet VIZIO\u2019s customers\u2019 needs.\nVIZIO may also match your data with VIZIO\u2019s partners\u2019 data to help market VIZIO\u2019s products or services to you and provide advertising tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online.</p>\n<p>\n<b>REMINDER:</b>&nbsp;You always have the option to control the collection of Viewing Data in your TV or display\u2019s Settings menu.\nViewing Data collection is only enabled if a user AGREES to this collection.&nbsp.\nHowever, for a period of time you may continue to see tailored ads on other devices that were targeted on the basis of Viewing Data that was shared before you turned off collection.\nDisabling the Video ACR (Viewing Data) feature in the Settings Menu will not, however, affect or limit Activity Data collection through SmartCast Products, which is used to personalize and recommend content within the SmartCast Product or SmartCast Mobile App.\nIf you intend to sell or otherwise give away your VIZIO TV or display, you should perform a \u201cfactory reset.\u201d<b> &nbsp;</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>How Does VIZIO Protect Viewing Data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>VIZIO uses reasonable and appropriate measures to protect information within VIZIO\u2019s organization.&nbsp.\nUnfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.\nTo help protect your information, we recommend consumers follow best practices for internet activities, including proactive password management and&nbsp;router security protocols<i>.</i>\n<b>How Can I Turn Off or On the Viewing Data (ACR) Feature?</b>\n</p>\n<p>At any time you may turn Viewing Data (ACR) collection off or on directly from the menu of your VIZIO TV or display.\nTurning Viewing Data (ACR)off will disable all future Viewing Data collection.</p>\n<p>For textual as well as graphical instructions on how to turn Viewing Data (ACR) off or on, visit&nbsp;http://www.vizio.com/viewingdata.\nIf you are unable to locate the Viewing Data setting on your VIZIO TV or display, contact VIZIO customer service by emailing privacy@vizio.com or calling (855) 472-8817.\nPlease note that if your TV or display is ever reset to factory settings, the device will return to its default settings, and Viewing Data will be reset to the \u201cOFF\u201d position.\nYou may again turn the feature on by following the procedure described above.</p>\n<p>Turning the Viewing Data (ACR) feature off or on will affect only the TV or display where you have made that selection.\nWhen you turn off collection of Viewing Data (if it was previously turned on), logs of Viewing Data will be deleted from our database.\nHowever, even if it is turned off, VIZIO may still collect other information when you separately provide such information to VIZIO, such as when you submit a support request or participate in a promotion, and VIZIO may still collect information from other sources as described in the VIZIO Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p> Be the first to receive VIZIO news,

detected for a single registered member, VIZIO may choose to void such accounts.\nThe authorized myVIZIO account holder is the individual natural person who is assigned to the email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization that is responsible for assigning an email address or the domain associated with the submitted email address.\nIn the event of a dispute about the identity of a member, VIZIO may require that the member provide proof that he/she is the authorized account holder of the email address and/or password associated with the account.</p>\n<p>Each user that properly completes the registration process will be considered a member for the purposes of these Terms of Use.\nVIZIO may refuse to offer or continue offering the Service to any person and may change its eligibility criteria from time to time.</p>\n4.\nREGISTRATION.\n<p>To become a member, you must complete the registration process by providing VIZIO with

Policy, or (d) VIZIO reasonably believes that such action is necessary to (i) comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of VIZIO or any user, or (iii) enforce the Terms of Use or any other agreement.</p>\n<p>VIZIO will use your social networking account information only as permitted under the Privacy

provided otherwise, you are solely responsible for your own costs and expenses to access and use the Service.\nVIZIO will determine whether (and how much) to charge for the Service.\nSince the Service

the price of that fee.\nUsers will be notified of fees and any fee changes.</p>\n7.\nFORUMS / POSTINGS.\n<p>The Service may include discussion forums, reviews or other features where members may upload, display or transmit user generated content, materials and other information of interest (<b>User Content</b>).</p>\n<p>Because VIZIO does not preview or review the postings or User Content on or otherwise via the Service, you must be careful in dealing with other members to avoid fraud.\nYou acknowledge that information provided by other members may, despite prohibitions in the Terms of Use, be harmful, inaccurate or deceptive.\nAuthentication of the true identity of Internet users is difficult, and VIZIO cannot and does not confirm that each member is the person who they claim to
