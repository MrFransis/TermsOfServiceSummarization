we\u2019ve done our best to offer you clear and simple explanations of what everything means.</p>\n<p>By using this website (the \u201cSite\u201d) and services (together with the Site, the \u201cServices\u201d) offered by Listudy.org (together with our subsidiaries, affiliates, representatives, and directors \u2013 collectively \u201cListudy\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, or \u201cus\u201d) you\u2019re agreeing to these legally binding rules (the \u201cTerms\u201d).\nYou\u2019re also agreeing to our Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, and agreeing to follow any other rules on the Site.</p>\n<p>We may change these terms from time to time.\nIf we do, we\u2019ll let you know about any significant or material changes, by notifying you on the Site.\nNew versions of the terms will

address.\nIf you don\u2019t submit accurate information, you might not be able to access your account.\nYou can choose any email (even fictitious ones).\nJust make sure to remember the email, because

public information, identity, and data protected as strongly as possible.\nWe use European Union data protection law as our baseline, and in many respects go further than what the law requires.\nWe\u2019ve also chosen to extend these rights to all users, not just those under a European Union jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>By agreeing to these Terms, registered Users can have access to all of Listudy\u2019 features and are free to use them for their own personal, educational, charitable, or developmental purposes.\nListudy itself is also free/libre open-source software licensed under

against our Users or against the operation of our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This list is non-exhaustive, and we reserve the right to add, edit, or remove entries from it at any time.</p> Privacy <p>Our privacy policy describes how we handle the information you provide to us when you use our services.\nYou understand that through your use of the services you consent to the collection and use, as set
