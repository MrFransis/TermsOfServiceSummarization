make available, directly or through a third party, Alight Creative Tokens.\nAlight Creative Tokens provide our users enhanced flexibility to customize their Alight Creative experience.\nAlight Creative Tokens may be redeemed to obtain a special feature or promotional items (e.g., Tickets, Assets) offered by Alight Creative and indicated as being available for purchase with Alight Creative Tokens (a \u201cToken Purchase\u201d).\nAlight Creative Tokens may also be used as credits in connection with a Promotional Subscription or another eligible promotional event or campaign, subject to the applicable terms thereof (a \u201cTokens Transactions\u201d).\nThe number of Alight Creative Tokens required to consummate Tokens Transactions shall be determined by Alight Creative, in our sole discretion, and may change from time to time, without advance notice.\nThe terms and conditions for consummating any Tokens Transactions are set forth here and may be amended in connection with any particular item and/or features (e.g., Tickets, Assets) available for a Tokens Purchase.\nAlight Creative Tokens associated with your account may only be redeemed for Tokens Transactions through your account, and Alight Creative Tokens associated with multiple accounts cannot be combined for any Tokens Transaction, even if those accounts belong to or are controlled by you.\nYou may review the number of Alight Creative Tokens in your account by the My Account screen in any Alight Creative branded application that provides Token Purchase.</p>\n<p>10.1.&nbsp;Alight Creative Tokens have no cash value, cannot be tendered for any cash amount, are non-transferable and may specify an expiration date, after which such Alight Creative Tokens are void.\nAlight Creative Tokens obtained in exchange for a Promotional Code that has an Expiration Date may automatically expire and become void either a predefined period after they are applied to your account, or the original Expiration Date of the Promotional Code, whichever is later.\nAlight Creative is under no obligation to accept or provide any compensation on account of any expired Alight Creative Tokens.\nIf we have a good faith belief that you have acquired or are attempting to use Alight Creative Tokens in a fraudulent manner, we reserve the right to cancel the Tokens in question.</p>\n<p>10.2.&nbsp;Token Purchases obtained using Alight Creative Tokens are not transferable.\nIf any items you obtain in a Tokens Purchase are returned to Alight Creative and a refund is available according to the terms of sale or applicable law, the Alight Creative Tokens used as payment for that Tokens Purchase are returned to your account, subject to any expiration or other applicable terms and conditions associated with the Tokens Purchase.\nIn no event shall Alight Creative provide you with any monetary refund for the portion of a purchase paid with Alight Creative Tokens.\nWhen Alight Creative Tokens associated with your account are used in a Tokens Transaction, you will be deemed by Alight Creative to have caused that Tokens Transaction, inasmuch as the username and password for that account are required in order to consummate the Tokens Transaction.\nAccordingly, Alight Creative will not reinstate any Alight Creative Tokens once they have been applied, and Alight Creative shall not have any liability for such use, even where you claim such use was unauthorized.</p>\n<p>10.3.&nbsp;Alight Creative does not authorize the use of Alight Creative Tokens to obtain any product, service or other items from any party other than Alight Creative, and Alight Creative shall not provide any third party any compensation or items of value on account of any Alight Creative Tokens you may provide to such third party.\nAlight Creative reserves the right, from time to time, to impose limitations on the use of Alight Creative Tokens including, without limitation, the maximum number of Alight Creative Tokens used in Tokens Transactions in any period of time and the maximum number of Alight Creative Tokens that may be accumulated in your Alight Creative Account.\nAlight Creative reserves the right to carry out the following actions without notice if we determine that any Alight Creative Tokens used in a Tokens Transaction were fraudulently obtained or invalid: (i) setoff the value of all goods, products or services obtained in such Tokens Transaction against any amounts payable by Alight Creative to you.\n(ii) bill to a credit card account registered to your account or invoice you the value of all goods, products or services obtained in such Tokens Transaction.\nand/or (iii) pursue any other method of recovery permissible under law.\nIf you receive an invoice for payment from Alight Creative on account of the use of any invalid Alight Creative Tokens, you agree to pay the required amount promptly within 30 days of receiving such invoice.\nIf your Alight Creative Service account is deactivated or closed, you shall lose all rights relating to the Alight Creative Tokens attributed to your account, and you forfeit and waive the right to demand any compensation from Alight Creative relating to such deactivation or closure.</p>\n<p>11.\nPromotional Code.\nAlight Creative may from time to time make available, directly or through a third party, gift cards or promotional codes or coupons that are redeemable for a specified Paid Service for a fixed period of time (individually, a \u201cPromotional Code\u201d and collectively, \u201cPromotional Codes\u201d), or which can be exchanged for Alight Creative Tokens, as described in more detail below.\nWe use the term \u201cPromotional Subscription\u201d to describe the specific subscription to a subscription basis Paid Service obtained with the Promotional Code and the term \u201cPromotional Period\u201d to describe the duration of a Promotional Subscription.\nA Promotional Code may specify an expiration date (\u201cExpiration Date\u201d), after which such Promotional Code shall be void.\nAlight Creative is under no obligation to accept an expired or otherwise invalid or void Promotional Code.\nPromotional Codes have no cash value and, except where expressly permitted by Alight Creative, are non-transferrable.\nAlight Creative is under no obligation to provide any compensation in connection with a Promotional Code.\nIn order to obtain a Promotional Subscription, you must be a registered Alight Creative Account holder and use the registration or redemption process, and satisfy any eligibility requirements, established by Alight Creative in connection with the Promotional Code.\nAt the conclusion of the Promotional Period, you will be required to pay the then-applicable charges for the Paid Service in order to continue using such Paid Service.\n</p>\n<p>Unless you have a separate contract with Alight Creative permitting you to distribute Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes, you are prohibited from selling or otherwise distributing or transferring Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes.\nAlight Creative reserves the right to invalidate any Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes that have been improperly issued or distributed, and we do not owe you any compensation with respect to such Alight Creative Tokens or Promotional Codes.\nIf a Promotional Code has been distributed to you by a third party (for example, connection with a third-party promotion), Alight Creative has no responsibility with respect to any third party product or service provided, or any marketing claims or promotional offers made, by the third party.\nAlight Creative has no obligation to provide you with any compensation, or to modify the Promotional Subscription or the Promotion Requirements in connection with any Promotional Codes you obtained from a third party that was acting improperly.</p>\n<p>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Term and Termination.</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;The term of
