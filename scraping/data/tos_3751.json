deal with other data that is not personal information as defined in the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation EU2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nThe term \u201cprocessing\u201d is used as defined in the GDPR.\nIt includes collection, storage, and all of the ways we use, and allow you to use, personal information, when we provide our services.\nYou are the data controller under the GDPR of the personal information you provide to us as part of your Account Data (see below).Your FilesThis is the section of this Policy that covers the actual encrypted files that you upload, access and share using our service.\nWhen you upload a file, it is already encrypted at your device, so we do not know whether it is personal to you or someone else, relates to a business or some other organisation, or what it contains.\nAll Your Files remain encrypted at all times while they are on our system.\nThey are never received, stored or otherwise dealt with by us in unencrypted form because any decryption takes place only on your device or that of another user to whom you have provided the file links and keys that are created when you give them access.\nYour Files are therefore not personal data under the GDPR since they are never held by Vault.ooo in a form that is information about an identified or identifiable natural person.\nWe collect Your Files because that is necessary for us to provide our end-to-end encrypted cloud storage and collaboration services.\nWe keep Your Files while you are subscribed to our services but subject to our suspension and termination rights set out in our Terms.\nYou must maintain copies of Your Files.\nWe do not make any guarantees that there will be no loss of data or the services will be bug free.\nIf you lose a file link, access to the file can not be restored.User DataWe don't collect or log any data of our users, especially no IP adresses, in respect for privacy.\nWe only have files uploaded by our users.Purchases made on Vault.oooWhen purchasing on vault.ooo, payment information provided by the payment service provider, time of purchase, delivery email, how long the purchased product will be active and the email address needed to assign the shared drive in Google Drive will be stored.Changes to our PolicyWe may make changes to this Policy in the future.\nTherefore, you should check this
