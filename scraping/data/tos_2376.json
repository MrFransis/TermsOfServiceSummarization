"<p>\n<strong>Effective May 23, 2018</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The following privacy notice addendum, together with the Endurance International Group Privacy Notice (the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d), is applicable to you if you purchased domain registration services from The Endurance International Group, Inc.\nor its subsidiaries (\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d or \u201cEndurance\u201d).\nPlease review the below in addition to the Privacy Notice.</p>Information Collection<p>When you purchase Domain Registration services for top level domains (\u201cTLDs\u201d), as the domain registrar, we are required to collect the following personal information from you (collectively, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d):</p>\n<p>Registrant Name<br> Registrant Organization (where applicable)<br> Registrant Address<br> Registrant Email<br> Registrant Fax (where applicable)<br> Registrant Phone number<br> Administrative Contact<br> Administrative Contact Organization (where applicable)<br> Administrative Contact Address<br> Administrative Contact Email<br> Administrative Contact Fax (where applicable)<br> Administrative Contact Telephone Number<br> Technical Contact<br> Technical Contact Organization

Organization (where applicable)<br> Billing Contact Address<br> Billing Contact Email<br> Billing Contact Fax (where applicable)<br> Billing Contact Telephone Number</p>\n<p>Our collection of Personal Information is necessary to comply with contractual obligations we have with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\u201cICANN\u201d) and with certain TLD registries (\u201cRegistries\u201d) so that you can validly register your domain name.\nIn addition to Personal Information, our contracts with some Registries may require us to collect other personal information for the registration of a TLD such as certain professional affiliations, identification or other qualifiers (\u201cAdditional Personal Information\u201d).</p>Disclosure of Information<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Public Whois.</strong> Our contracts with ICANN and other Registries require us to make certain domain name information (\u201cWHOIS Information\u201d), available and accessible to the public through a WHOIS search as required by ICANN/Registry Policy (the \u201cWHOIS Directory\u201d).\nThe WHOIS Directory is a publicly accessible database that lists WHOIS Information, including a particular domain name, the name server(s) to which the domain name points, and the domain name\u2019s creation and expiration date.\nExcept for EU/EEA natural persons (as described below), your Personal Information could be displayed on the WHOIS Directory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>EU/EEA natural persons.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or GDPR, if you are a EU/EEA natural person (as defined by the GDPR), other than as specified in this addendum, our publication of WHOIS Information will not contain any Personal Information.\nAccordingly, we will not display Personal Information of a EU/EEA natural person in the WHOIS Directory.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transfer Out.</strong> If you initiate a transfer out of a domain name away from us as the registrar of record, pursuant to our contract with ICANN, we may need to publish your registrant email address obtained from your Personal Information in the WHOIS Directory for a period of approximately five (5) calendar days.\nAfter this period and assuming a valid transfer has occurred, you would cease to be our customer for that domain name and your WHOIS Information would be managed by the gaining registrar.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Certain Registries.</strong> Registries are third party providers of TLDs that are independent of domain registrars.\nIf required by contract with a particular Registry, we may be obligated, as a domain registrar of domains provided by the Registry, to provide Personal Information and Additional Personal Information to such Registry to successfully complete your domain name registration.\nIf we provide your Personal Information and Additional Personal Information to a Registry, the Registry has its own obligation to comply with applicable data privacy laws.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Escrow.</strong> Our contract with ICANN requires us to deposit the Personal Information collected with a secure third-party escrow provider who acts solely as a holder of the data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Permitted Disclosures.</strong> We may also disclose your Personal Information when required by the rules, regulations and policies of ICANN, including but not limited to the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Last

Massachusetts, regardless of your location, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.\n<strong>Arbitration</strong> You hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in connection with any dispute relating to, concerning or arising out of these Terms.\n&nbsp;The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator and will be held at the AAA location in Boston, Massachusetts.\n&nbsp;Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA\u2019s rules, unless otherwise stated in this paragraph.\n&nbsp;In the event you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Endurance will pay as much of your filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\n&nbsp;The arbitration before the AAA shall proceed solely on an individual basis without the right for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of others.\n&nbsp;The arbitrator\u2019s authority to resolve and make written awards is limited to claims between you and us alone.\n&nbsp;Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless agreed to in writing by all parties.\n&nbsp;No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.\n&nbsp;If you initiate a litigation or any other proceeding against Endurance in violation of this paragraph, you agree to pay Endurance\u2019s reasonable costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with its enforcement of this paragraph.\n<strong>Severability</strong> If any portion of these Terms shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions (unless otherwise specified) thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining portions (unless otherwise specified) thereof shall remain in full force and effect.\n<strong>Miscellaneous</strong> Our failure to exercise or enforce any right
