<p>This chapter applies to the Matrix service provided at https://nitro.chat.</p>\n<p>When you read 'the NitroChat homeserver', 'NitroChat' or 'the Service' below, it refers to the services made available at nitro.chat which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.</p>\n<p>The public Matrix Network is a decentralized and openly federated communication network.\nThis means that user messages are replicated on each participant's server and messages posted to a room are visible to all participants including in some cases any new joiners.\nThis is further explained below.</p>\n<p>Where you read Nitrokey, Nitrokey GmbH or we, our, or us below, all refer to the same company.</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.\nRight to Erasure</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can request that we forget your copy of messages and files by instructing us to deactivate your account (using a Matrix client such as https://app.nitro.chat) and selecting the option instructing us to forget your messages.\nWhat happens next depends on who else had access to the messages and files you had shared.</p>\n<p>Any messages or files that were only accessible by your account will be deleted from our servers within 30 days.</p>\n<p>Where you shared messages or files with another registered Matrix user, that user will still have access to their copy of those messages or files.\nApart from state events (see below), these messages and files will not be shared with any unregistered or new users who view the room after we have processed your request to be forgotten.</p>\n<p>State events are processed differently to non-state events.\nState events are used by the Service to record, amongst other things, your membership in a room, the configuration of room settings, your changing of another user's power level and your banning a user from a room.\nWere we to erase these state events from a room entirely, it would be very damaging to other users' experience of the room, causing banned users to become unbanned, revoking legitimate administrator privileges, etc.\nWe therefore share state events sent by your account with all non-essential data removed ('redacted'), even after we have processed your request to be forgotten.\nThis means that your username will continue to be publicly associated with rooms in which you have participated, even after we have processed your request to be forgotten.\nWe are actively working on a solution to work around this restriction and allow you to be fully forgotten while maintaining a high quality experience for other users.\nIf this is not acceptable to you, please do not use the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.\nWhat Information Do You Collect About Me and Why?</b>\n</p>\n<p>The information we collect is purely for the purpose of providing your communication service via Matrix.\nWe do **not** profile users or their data on the Service.</p>\n<p>Be aware that while we do not profile users on the Service, third party Matrix clients may gather usage data.\nThis includes the Matrix client Riot provided at https://app.nitro.chat which optionally gathers opt-in anonymised usage data under New Vector Ltd.'s privacy notice at https://riot.im/privacy.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.1 Information you provide to us:</b>\n</p>\n<p>We collect information about you when you input it into the Service or otherwise provide it directly to us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Account and Profile Information</b>\n</p>\n<p>We collect information about you when you register for an account.\nThis information is kept to a minimum on purpose, and is restricted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Username</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Password</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Display Name (if you choose to provide one)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your email address (if you choose to provide it)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your verified telephone number (if you choose to provide it)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your username and password is used to authenticate your access to the Service and to uniquely identify you within the Service.</p>\n<p>Your password is stored until you change it or your account is deactivated.\nYour username is stored indefinitely to avoid account recycling.</p>\n<p>Your email address and/or telephone number, if you choose to provide them, are used so that other users can look up your Matrix ID from these identifiers.\nThese are stored and processed by the chosen 3rd party identity service such as vector.im.\nTheir privacy policy apply.</p>\n<p>We will also use your email address to let you reset your password if you forget it, and to send you notifications about missed messages from users trying to contact you on Matrix if you enable the option.\nWe may also send you infrequent urgent messages about platform updates.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Content you provide through using the Service</b>\n</p>\n<p>We store and distribute the messages and files you share using the Service (and across the wider Matrix ecosystem via federation) as described by the Matrix protocol and according to the access rules configured within the system.\nStoring and sharing this content is the reason the Service exists.</p>\n<p>This content includes any information about yourself that you choose to share.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2 Information we collect automatically as you use the Service:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Device and Connection Information</b>\n</p>\n<p>Each device you use to access the Service is allocated a (user-configurable) identifier.\nWhen you access the Service, we record the device identifier, the IP address it used to connect, user agent, and the time at which it last connected to the service.</p>\n<p>This information is gathered to help you to manage your devices - you can view and manage the list of devices by connecting to the Service with a Matrix client such as https://app.nitro.chat</p>\n<p>Currently, we log the IP addresses of everyone who accesses the Service.\nThis data is used in order to mitigate abuse, debug operational issues, and monitor traffic patterns.\nOur logs are kept for not longer than 7 days.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nWhat Information is Shared With Third Parties and Why?</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.1 Sharing Data with Connected Services</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may share your information when working with our suppliers in order to provide the Service.</p>\n<p>In addition, NitroChat is a decentralised and open service.\nThis means that, to support communication between users on different homeservers or different messaging platforms, your username, display name and messages and files are sometimes shared with other services that are connected with the NitroChat.\nThese other services may be outside of the EU.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Federation</b>\n</p>\n<p>Matrix homeservers share user data with the wider ecosystem over federation.</p>\n<p>When you send messages or files in a room, a copy of the data is sent to all participants in the room, including (depending on room settings) participants who join the room in future.\nIf these participants are on remote homeservers, your username, display name, messages and files may be replicated across each participating homeserver.</p>\n<p>We will forget your copy of your data upon your request.\nWe will also forward your request to be forgotten onto federated homeservers.\nHowever - these homeservers are outside our span of control, so we cannot guarantee they will forget your data.</p>\n<p>Federated homeservers can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Access control settings are shared between homeservers, as well as any requests to remove messages by \"redactions\", or remove personal data under GDPR Article 17 Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten).\nFederated homeservers and Matrix clients which respect the Matrix protocol are expected to honour these controls and redaction/erasure requests, but other federated homeservers are outside of the span of control of Nitrokey GmbH, and we cannot guarantee how this data will be processed.\nFederated homeservers can also be located in any territory, and will be subject to the local regulations of that territory.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Bridging</b>\n</p>\n<p>Some Matrix rooms are bridged to third-party services, such as IRC networks, Twitter or email.\nWhen a room has been bridged, your username, display name, messages and file transfers may be duplicated on the bridged service where supported.</p>\n<p>It may not be technically possible to support your management of your data once it has been copied onto a bridged service.</p>\n<p>Bridged services can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.</p>\n<p>Access control settings, requests to remove messages by \"redactions\" or remove personal data under GDPR Article 17 Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten) are shared to bridging services, which are expected to honour them to the best of their ability.\nBe aware that not all bridged networks or bridges support the necessary technical capabilities to limit, remove or erase messages.\nIf this is not acceptable to you, please do not use bridged rooms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.2 Sharing Data in Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.\nEnforcement of Our Rights</b>\n</p>\n<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to</p>\n<p>(a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,</p>\n<p>(b) protect the security or integrity of our products and services (e.g.\nfor a security audit),</p>\n<p>(c) protect Nitrokey GmbH and our users from harm or illegal activities, or</p>\n<p>(d) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the serious bodily harm of any person.</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nHow Do You Handle Passwords?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We never store password data in plain text.\ninstead they are stored hashed (with at least 4096 rounds of bcrypt, including both a salt and a server-side pepper secret).\nPasswords sent to the server are encrypted using TLS.</p>\n<p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential.\nActions taken using your credentials shall be deemed to be actions taken by you, with all consequences including service termination, civil and criminal penalties.</p>\n<p>If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify Nitrokey GmbH immediately by sending us an email.\nSuspicious devices can be deleted using the User Settings management tools in a Matrix client such as https://app.nitro.chat, and users should manage good password hygiene (e.g.\nusing a password manager) and change their password if they believe their account is compromised.</p>\n<p>If you forget your password (and you have registered an email address) you can use the password reset facility to reset it.</p>\n<p>You can manage your account by using a Matrix client such as https://app.nitro.chat.</p>\n<p>We will never change a password for you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nHow Can I Access or Correct My Information?</b>\n</p>\n<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect by using any compatible Matrix client (such as https://app.nitro.chat) and managing your User Settings.\nYou can get a copy of all your data.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nWho Can See My Messages and Files?</b>\n</p>\n<p>In unencrypted and encrypted rooms, users connecting to NitroChat (directly or over federation) will be able to see messages and files according to the access permissions configuration of the relevant room.\nThis data is stored in the format it was received on our servers, and can be viewed by Nitrokey engineers (employees and contractors) under the conditions outlined below.</p>\n<p>In encrypted rooms, the data is stored in our databases but the encryption keys are stored only on your devices or by yourself.\nUsers can optionally backup an encrypted copy of their keys on the Service to aid recovery if they lose all their keys and devices.\nThis key backup is encrypted by a recovery key that only the user has access to.\nThis means that nobody, even Nitrokey engineers (employees and contractors) can see your message content in our database, and if you lose access to your encryption keys you lose access to your messages forever.</p>\n<p>We use HTTPS to transfer all data.\nEnd-to-end encrypted messaging data is stored encrypted using AES-256, using message keys generated using the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets.</p>\n<p>\n<b>7.\nWhat Are the Guidelines Nitrokey Follows When Accessing My Data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We restrict who at Nitrokey GmbH (employees and contractors) can access user data to roles which require access in order to maintain the health of the Service.</p>\n<p>We never share what we see with other users or the general public.</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nWho Else Has Access to My Data?</b>\n</p>\n<p>We host the service in Hetzner's data centers in Germany.</p>\n<p>We use secure private keys when accessing servers via SSH.</p>\n<p>We log application data (username, user IP and user agent).\nWe keep logs for no longer than 7 days.</p>\n<p>This chapter is based on https://matrix.org/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html</p> V.\nNitrokey Meet <p>To provide the Nitrokey Meet service at https://meet.nitrokey.com, we process network and usage information including IP addresses for the meeting participants, the user specified URL used to host the meeting, and information about the phone numbers that connect to the meeting (if audio connection is made via a telephone call).\nThis information is stored in logs not longer than 7 days.\nIn some cases, meeting related content, which may contain personal information, is temporarily stored to enable user functionality in a Nitrokey Meet video meeting.\nExamples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use the chat function, chat content is stored during the meeting.</li>\n<li>If you record a meeting, the recording of the meeting is temporarily stored until it is uploaded to your file hosting service.</li>\n<li>If you livestream your meeting, video content is temporarily stored to buffer the livestream.</li>\n<li>In addition, users of Nitrokey Meet have the option of providing name, email address, and link to a picture that will be displayed to participants in the meeting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We don\u2019t sell personal information to third parties.\nWe use this information to deliver the Nitrokey Meet service, to identify and troubleshoot problems with the Nitrokey Meet service, and to improve the Nitrokey Meet service.\nIn addition, we may use this information to investigate fraud or abuse.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Status:
