at TV Tropes, we're not very big on official rules.\nRules lead to people looking for loopholes.\nWe prefer general guidelines and rely on people's good sense, or our staff (if people are short of good sense), to determine when someone has crossed the line.\nThese guidelines are the <strong>TV Tropes Customs</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>We tend not to even think of these customs, but to someone who's new to the wiki \u2014 especially its sub-regions like the Trope Launch Pad or Trope Repair Shop \u2014 they may be totally foreign.\nBut that's not an issue \u2014 we're perfectly willing to teach you about our unique and totally not scary culture:\n</p>Advertisement:<p>\n</p>General\n<p>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Don't be a dick.</strong> We can't stress this enough.\nWe expect editors to treat each other politely, even when they disagree.\nThis includes forum posts, edit reasons, discussion pages, and contributor pages.\nOur culture strives to be civil, even when we would rather not be.\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> We aim for \"family-friendly\" \u2014 our mantra is No Lewdness, No Prudishness.\nWe're perfectly willing to discuss all the sex, violence, and naughty language that are prevalent in media, but we ask for just the facts, ma'am.\nIn particular, this is not a place for you to creepily gush about how you, the editor, finds someone (or something) attractive or sexy.\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> If you happen to be suspended from editing, it's very likely not permanent.\nDon't think of it as a punishment.\nMany times, people who are suspended see it as a castigation and complain that they didn't even get a warning, but that's not what a suspension is \u2014 it's simply a way for the staff to get your attention and come to the Edit Banned thread so that we can discuss what you did wrong.\nThe edit ban simply prevents you from doing more damage in your ignorance.\nOnce we're satisfied that you learned what you did wrong and you won't do it again (or cleared up a misunderstanding on our end, which does happen sometimes), we'll release your suspension.\nWe're not looking for groveling \u2014 just politeness and a willingness to learn.\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> Our primary purpose here is to catalog tropes.\nWe earnestly wish to have fun while doing so, and we encourage breezy, colloquial language and wittiness whenever possible.\nWe're also okay with things existing Just For Fun...\nright up until the point it starts conflicting with our Prime Directive.\nKeep the fun where it belongs, and everything will operate smoothly.\n<p>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> On the other hand, if your idea of \"fun\" is bashing works, creators, or life in general, this probably isn't the wiki for you.\nWe're here to <em>celebrate</em> fiction, not bash it.\nAnd it goes the other way, too \u2014 \"celebrating\" doesn't mean gushing about how awesome your favourite thing is, even if it's not as disruptive as bashing.\n</li>\n</ol>Advertisement:<p>\n</p>Editing the wiki proper\n<ol>\n<li> This hardly bears saying, but any kind of page vandalism isn't allowed, even if it's only a joke.</li>\n<li> Edit Wars aren't allowed either, even if you <em>know</em> you're right.\nThere are several venues for you to discuss a contentious edit, such as the discussion page, by messaging the other Troper, or by bringing the issue to Ask The Tropers.</li>\n<li> Edit Reasons are <em>strongly</em> encouraged.\nWe're not psychic, and what's obvious to you may not be obvious to everyone.\nPlease let us know what you're doing.\nIt's particularly important to leave an edit reason if you're deleting content.</li>\n<li> Never remove all the content from a page.\nThat's called page blanking, and it's nearly guaranteed to be a one-way ticket to a suspension.\nIf an entire page needs to go, use the Cut List.\n</li>\n<li> The Fic May Be Yours, but the Trope Page Is Ours.\nAs long as it's within the content guidelines, no one can tell us what we can or can't trope.\nIf you're the author of a work and we have a page on it, you do not have the right to blank the page.\nIf you feel the page is misleading, negative, or has other problems, you do have the right to fix or discuss them, but be aware that your strong feelings may indicate that you are biased on this issue and should probably seek a second opinion.</li>\n<li> When it comes to American vs.\nBritish spelling, whichever one gets there first wins.\nThat's why we have Colour-Coded for Your Convenience and Color-Coded Elements on Main, while the other spelling gets redirect status.\nPlease don't \"correct\" American or British spelling on any page you see.</li>\n<li> Don't forget to double-check a trope's description and definition before you add it to a page.\nIt might not be what it sounds like, or the definition may have shifted since the last time you read it.</li>\n<li> We encourage people who spot minor problems to just fix it themselves.\nIf you see a bad example, bad formatting, an index a trope really should be on, a sister trope that isn't mentioned, or some other small problem with any page, please feel free to fix it.\nAnd by fix it, we mean fix it directly, not add a sub-bullet correcting it.</li>\n<li> It is perfectly permissible to namespace a work page, soft or hard split example lists on work pages, folderize or namespace example lists on trope pages, or create redirects without anyone's permission, although you should leave an edit reason and note on the discussion page.</li>\n<li> If you come across a Zero-Context Example, the best thing to do is expand it.\nIf you're not familiar enough with the source material, the preferred method of dealing with it is to change it to a comment (add \"%%\" to the beginning of the line).\nThis will make it invisible to the casual reader, but it will be visible on the edit screen, so any other editor who sees it later and <em>does</em> know enough to expand it may do so.\nIf you're familiar enough with the work to know that the example is also <em>wrong</em>, by all means, delete it and leave an edit reason.\nSee the Fixing Zero-Context Examples thread for more information.</li>\n<li> For potentially Not Safe for Work stuff, see No Lewdness, No Prudishness.\nShort version: Sex is a part of fiction, so you can talk <em>about</em> (most of) that stuff, as long as you don't turn the page itself into an <em>example</em> of it.\nThere are some things that are forbidden to ensure the site's very survival, though: See The Content Policy and the 5P Circuit.</li>\n</ol>Advertisement:<p>\n</p>Page and Image Repairs\n<ol>\n<li> Major changes, such as redefining a trope, renaming it, removing all or most of the examples, cutting it, merging it with another trope, or splitting it into multiple tropes, need a general consensus to go forward.\nPlease take issues of that nature to the Trope Repair Shop rather than attempting the fix yourself.</li>\n<li> Crowners are our voting system.\nThe name is an Artifact Title from an abortive attempt at a voting system for a work's single best Moment of Awesome (which at the time we called a \"<em>Crowning</em> Moment of Awesome\"), but the system never took off for that purpose \u2014 it's now used for wiki-side discussions.\nWe use them any time we need to get a consensus, usually for picking an image or deciding how to fix a trope that seems broken.\nPlease see How Crowners Work for more information on this process.</li>\n<li> If a page does not have an image and you want to add one, you can do so yourself, as long as the image doesn't violate any of our policies on images.\nIf the page already has an image and you want to change it, or if you just want community feedback on an image, please go to Image Pickin'.\nImages chosen through Image Pickin' will be marked as such in the edit screen \u2014 if so, do not change or remove it without going back into Image Pickin'.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>Creating Pages and Trope Launch Pad\n<ol>\n<li> If you want to add a new trope, go to Trope Launch Pad.\nWe have a <em>lot</em> of tropes on here, and just allowing people to add tropes on their own can make things messy <em>really</em> quickly.\nTLP Guidelines fleshes out how to use the Trope Launch Pad and what needs to happen before a new trope can be launched.\nThe same applies for new indexes, and indeed any new page in the Main/ namespace.</li>\n<li> Works Pages Are a Free Launch.\nIf you know a work that doesn't have a page, just add it yourself! (Unless it violates our Content Policy.) However, if you don't <em>want</em> to do it on your own, you're more than welcome to go to the Trope Launch Pad and ask for the community's help with it (just let them know that this is what you're doing \u2014 otherwise they'll just tell you that you don't need a TLP for a work page).</li>\n<li> All the rules about editing wiki pages apply to TLP drafts \u2014 it's okay to add examples and do <em>minor</em> fixes to the description, but any major changes (or anything you're not sure about) should be discussed first.</li>\n<li> Launching a new page is an art unto itself, and the TLP Guidelines will help you out with that.\nIf you do it wrong, you'll launch an empty red link instead of your trope.</li>\n<li> It's considered rude to launch a TLP that someone else started.\nHowever, the main exception is if it's Up for Grabs \u2014 that's a notification from the Troper who started it that anyone else can launch it if it's ready.\nYou can also launch it if the sponsor hasn't edited the draft for at least two months.\nIf you <em>mislaunch</em> a trope like this, you court the fiery wrath of the other TLPers.</li>\n<li> Our policy for names is Clear, Concise, Witty, in that order of importance.\nPlease don't be offended if your proposed trope name is shot down for failing those criteria.</li>\n<li> In TLP, don't ignore suggestions or launch a trope that has objections to one or more aspects until those have been resolved.\nIf in doubt, ask for help in the TLP Workstation Thread.</li>\n<li> Don't forget to index pages that you create.\nTo do so, find the appropriate index and add a link to your article in the proper order.\nYou must do this <em>after</em> you create the page for the indexing to work.\nIf you need help finding an index, post here.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Alternative Title(s):</strong>\nTV Tropes Rules Previous\nIndex\nNext <ul>\n<li>\nThe Goals of TV Tropes\n</li>\n<li>\nAdministrivia\n</li>\n<li>\nThe Troping

comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\nThis page describes the information that should be present in these notices.\nIt is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to TVTropes.org (\"TVTropes\") as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify.\nThe form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S.\nCopyright Office Web Site, http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt is expected that all users of any part of TVTropes will comply with applicable copyright laws.\nHowever, if TVTropes receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections

the complaining party may be contacted.\n</li>\n<li>\n4.\nThe following statement: \"I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright

attorney.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>Counter Notification</p>\n<p>\nA provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the

receipt of such counter notification, TVTropes will promptly provide the person who provided the original infringement notification with a copy of the counter notification, and inform that person that
