below will become effective May 25, 2018.\nTo view the current Privacy Policy, click <u>here</u> .\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>PDF-XChange cares about your privacy.&nbsp.\nFor this reason, we collect and use personal data only as it might be needed for us to deliver to you our world-class products, services, websites and mobile applications (collectively, our \u201cServices\u201d).\nYour personal data includes information such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Telephone number</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Other data collected that could directly or indirectly identify you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy is intended to describe to you how and what data we collect, and how and why we use your personal data.\nIt also describes options we provide for you to access, update or otherwise take control of your personal data that we process.</p>\n<p>If at any time you have questions about our practices or any of your rights described below, you may reach our Data Protection Officer (\u201cDPO\u201d) and our dedicated team that supports this office by contacting us at privacy@tracker-software.com.\nThis inbox is actively monitored and managed so that we can deliver an experience that you can confidently trust.</p>\n<p>You can update the information we retain on you and use to manage your ongoing experience with us when doing business at any time by going to your account page and modifying the information any time.</p> What information do we collect? <p>We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilize our Services.\nMuch of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>create an account or purchase any of our Services (ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification);</li>\n<li>request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number);</li>\n<li>complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email).\nor</li>\n<li>participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.\nThese methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account related information</strong> is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, purchases, when products renew or expire, information requests, and customer service requests and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and similar technologies</strong> on our websites and our mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services.\nThis allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect infromation about, analyze and improve the performance of our Services.\nWe may also collect your location (IP address) so that we can personalize our Services.\nFor additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilize, please visit our <u>Cookie Policy</u>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data about Usage of Services</strong> is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs and

Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data, and some of this data collected might be capable of and be used to approximate your location.</p> How we utilize information.\n<p>We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) <em>for which we have been given permission</em>, (2) <em>as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with</em>, or (3) <em>as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes</em>.\nThese uses include:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing the Services we provide to you.</strong> We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services.\nWe utilize this information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites or applications)</li>\n<li>Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services</li>\n<li>Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems</li>\n<li>Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services</li>\n<li>Understand and analyze how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Often, much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data, but to the extent it is itself personal data, or is linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly.</p> Sharing with trusted third parties.\n<p>We may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Processing credit card transactions at your request \u2013 we never retain any Credit Card Information directly ourselves and once a

government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.\nWe will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>\n<p>To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.</p> Website analytics <p>We use

service partners on servers in a country other than the country in which you reside.\nThough information collected does not include personal data such as name, address, billing information, etc., the information collected is used and shared by these service providers in accordance with their individual privacy policies.\nYou can control the technologies we use by managing your settings through
