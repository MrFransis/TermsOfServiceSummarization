specifications and availability of the products and/or services listed on the Site and the Delivery.com Apps has been provided by merchant members.\nMerchant members advised us that the prices charged by merchant members on the Site and the Delivery.com Apps are generally the same as the prices charged in their brick-and-mortar stores at the time an order for products is delivered or available for pickup or at the time an order for services is fulfilled, as applicable.\nAlthough Delivery.com attempts to make certain that the prices, specifications and availability listed on the Site and the Delivery.com Apps and those posted in the stores on the date they are viewed on the Site and the Delivery.com Apps are the same, and that unavailable products and/or services (e.g., out-of-stock items or out-of-geographical range or discontinued services) are clearly marked or removed from the inventory on the Site and the Delivery.com Apps.\nPrices, specifications and availability of products and/or services may differ and are subject to change, including if you select a delivery or pickup date that is different from the date on which you place your order.\nAlso, prices charged by merchant members that use third party delivery services may sometimes be different than those charged in their physical stores.</p>\n<p>Past orders that were paid for with discounts or promotions will not be eligible for reordering using deliveryXpress\u2122.\nTo calculate the total price of an order you placed on the Site or the Delivery.com Apps, merchant members use the information collected at the time you placed such order on the Site and/or the Delivery.com Apps, as applicable, in each case, as evidenced by our systems.\nIf the information you entered is incorrect or additional information is submitted, merchant members may update your order, including the total price, accordingly.\nFor example, in case of an order you placed on the Site or the Delivery.com Apps for laundry services, if you entered the wrong information regarding the number (e.g., \"5\" shirts instead of \"6\") or type (e.g., \"skirt\" instead of \"dress\") of items, your order may be updated by the merchant member.\nAdditional fees and charges may apply as a consequence of such update.\nFurther, certain products and/or services may no longer be available after merchant members review and/or update your order.\nWe will of course let you know of any price update as your order is being processed! </p>\n<p>Moreover, though every effort is made to ensure accuracy in posting pricing information, discrepancies do occur.\nWhile Delivery.com has undertaken to confirm the accuracy of the information contained on the Site and the Delivery.com Apps, mistakes can be made, including due both to inaccurate reporting of accurate information and accurate reporting of inaccurate information.\nOf course, if you become aware that the Site or any of the Delivery.com Apps contains inaccurate information, please let us know by contacting us.\n</p>\n<p>Any and all sales, use and other taxes which may be levied as a result of your access to and/or use of the Site and/or the Delivery.com Apps are and shall remain your sole responsibility, excluding only taxes based on our net income.\n</p>\n<p>All or a portion of your order amount, including Fees and Charges (as defined in the \"Fees.\nGratuities\" section), may not be refundable depending on when your order is cancelled.\nIf you need to cancel your order, please contact support by phone at (800) 709-7191 or email at support@delivery.com.</p>OFFICE ACCOUNT.\nTAX EXEMPT PURCHASES <p>Companies or organizations may be eligible to open a delivery.com office account pursuant to a separate agreement with us (\"Office Account\").\nAny such company or organization may elect to pay for certain orders placed using User Codes recognized by our systems as being associated with the applicable Office Account.\nSuch company or association may be able from time to time to set certain settings for the orders it will pay for (e.g., lunch hours, delivery at the office address, order amount covered, etc.) Details of any and all such orders may be shared with and/or made available to such company or organization, including for record keeping and/or billing purposes.\nYou hereby acknowledge and agree to such sharing and/or making available.</p>\n<p>In the event that you provided us with a tax exemption certificate and/or other equivalent tax exemption documentation or information acceptable to the relevant tax authority for the Office Account, certain orders placed using the User Codes recognized by our systems as being associated with such Office Account may be eligible for tax exemption.\nIn such case, a tax exemption may be applied at checkout by following instructions on the checkout page of the Site.\nYou further agree that, if you do not use the products and/or services purchased using the User Codes recognized by our systems as being associated with such Office Account for the purpose for which the tax exemption applies, you will report and pay all applicable taxes and indemnify us against any liability, including interest and penalties, arising in respect of any applicable taxes.\nTo qualify for tax exemption, you may be required by law, among other things, to pay using solely the payment method recognized by our systems as being associated with the applicable Office Account (e.g., a company credit card) and not a personal payment method (e.g., a personal credit card).\nYou further represent and warrant that any and all purchases made using the User Codes are made with the tax-exempt organization\u2019s funds.\nYou are solely responsible for determining that any purchase made using any User Code recognized by our systems as being associated with the Office Account is eligible for exemption from applicable taxes and you agree that you will comply with any and all requirements existing from time to time for the obtaining and maintenance of tax exempt treatment for any purchases, including pursuant to applicable laws, rules or regulations, as well as with Delivery.com's instructions from time to time.</p>FEES.\nGRATUITIES<p>Certain orders may be subject to a delivery fee, service charge and/or required tip, each as further described below (collectively, the \"Fees and Charges\") charged and retained by us, or the applicable third party merchant(s) and/or third party services provider(s) (which may include independently owned and operated Delivery.com franchised businesses, collectively, the \"Third Party Providers\") and passed through to you.\nThe \"Delivery Fee\" is a percentage or fixed fee that goes towards the delivery of your order.\nThe \"Service Charge\" is a percentage fee or fixed fee that may include one or more of the following charges: a service fee, a convenience fee, packaging fee, processing fee, and/or jurisdiction-specific fees (e.g., bag or healthcare fees).\nA small number of Third Party Providers also mandate we include a \"Required Tip\" with your order, which, where applicable, will be identified at checkout.</p>\n<p>Fees and Charges are displayed prior to checkout and will be added to the total amount due at checkout for the applicable order for which you are responsible to pay.\nPlease note that the Fees and Charges may change after checkout if your order amount changes (e.g., as a result of your special instructions or inaccurate information given when placing your order).</p>\n<p>In addition, as a courtesy, there is an option to add a tip to the sub-total of an eligible order at checkout.\nYou can always give delivery personnel a cash tip at the time your order is delivered.</p>PLACING ORDERS FOR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES AND/OR TOBACCO PRODUCTS USING THE SITE OR THE DELIVERY.COM APPS<p>By using the Site or any of the Delivery.com Apps to place orders for
