no right to receive it.\nWe may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>\n<p>Time Limit to Respond</p>\n<p>We will respond to all legitimate requests within forty-five days, or as permitted by the CCPA.</p>K.\nCanadian Residents<p>Canadian citizens, except under circumstances defined by law, are entitled to access their own Personal Information, to the extent covered by applicable law, collected by Slashdot by writing to: Slashdot Media, LLC dba Slashdot Media, PO Box 2452, La Jolla, CA 92038.\nIf you believe that the Personal Information about you that we have collected is incomplete or inaccurate, please contact us and we will correct the information upon verification of the omission or error and of the identity of the person requesting the change.</p>L.\nEEA Rights under the GDPR<p>Users who are resident in the European Economic Area (EEA) have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and applicable law.\nEEA users benefit from our certification to Privacy Shield, which is described at the beginning of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>To make this section more reader-friendly, we use everyday words such as use, transfer and storage to describe what we do with your Personal Information \u2013 but this Notice covers processing of any kind that is subject to EEA data protection law.</p>\n<p>Slashdot processes Personal Information as a \u201cprocessor,\u201d \u201cjoint controller,\u201d and as a \u201ccontroller\u201d under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation.\nA \u201ccontroller\u201d is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed.\nAny third parties that act as our service providers are \u201cdata processors\u201d that handle your Personal Information in accordance with our instructions.\nWith respect to your Personal Information that you enter or that is received through our Sites, Slashdot is the controller.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we will use and share your Personal Information:</strong> We will use and share your Personal Information as described in this section and elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How we secure your data:</strong> See our description of our security practices here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Basis for processing of your Personal Information:</strong> We rely on three primary bases for processing EEA Personal Information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The first one is our legitimate interests, which we weigh against any risks to your rights.\nBy \u201clegitimate interests,\u201d we mean the ordinary needs and objectives of a business that offers the types of services available on our Sites, including security, quality assurance (such as preventing the dissemination or malware and misuse of our Sites and services), customer service, communicating with users to better serve them, and improving and developing new products and services.</li>\n<li>The second one is when processing is necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.</li>\n<li>The third basis is consent \u2013 you will know when we are relying on consent because we will have expressly asked you for your consent (and if you don\u2019t give us consent, we won\u2019t perform the processing in question).\nAlso, the sections titled \u201cHow we use Personal Information\u201d and \u201cHow we share information we gather\u201d flag the uses that are based on consent by marking them with an asterisk.</li>\n<li>We may also process your Personal Information on the basis that we need to do so to fulfill our legal obligations.\nWe expect this would be a rare situation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Revoking your consent:</strong> If you have given us consent to process your Personal Information, you can withdraw it by emailing us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com.\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time, although your withdrawal will not apply to processing that took place with your consent before you withdrew it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u201cSpecial\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d personal data:</strong> We do not intentionally collect any Personal Information that is considered \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d under the GDPR, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health or anything to do with a person\u2019s sexuality.\nWe also do not collect information about criminal convictions or offenses.\nWe request that you refrain from sharing any such Personal Information via the Sites or in connection with our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Access, correction, restriction and deletion.</strong> Your right to access your data and/or correct your data, and how to make a request, is described in the section titled \u201cAccess.\u201d You may request a copy of your Personal Information, and we reserve the right to charge a reasonable administrative fee for providing a copy to you, as permitted by applicable law.\nYou may also request that your data be deleted, and we will comply with your deletion request unless applicable law permits us to refuse the request, in which case we will tell you that we have rejected your request and give you the reasons why.\nYou may request that the use of your Personal Information be restricted, subject to Article 21 of the GDPR.\nIf you make a data restriction request, we will discuss it with you and, in any event, we will comply with any obligations we may have under Article 21 of the GDPR.\nWhere appropriate, we may address your request by de-identifying the data such that it no longer identifies you, consistent with applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Portability</strong>.\nThe GDPR provides certain rights relating to data portability.\nYou may request data portability to the extent provided by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Profiling.</strong> Paragraph (b) under the section titled \u201cHow we share information we gather\u201d describes how we use Personal Information for profiling, and how we share profiles with third parties.\nYou can opt out of profiling for direct marketing at any time by contacting us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com and we will honor your request.\nWhen we engage in profiling for other purposes that don\u2019t involve direct marketing, we will consider your request and honor it unless we determine that we have compelling legitimate in continuing the profiling that override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or the continued profiling is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nWe expect that this would be rare, but one example might be profiling to prevent fraud or the misuse of our Sites and Services.\nWe will explain our reasoning to you if we reject your request to stop profiling.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long we keep your Personal Information:</strong> We retain your personal data as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.\nWe retain your personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Slashdot Services, or as otherwise required by applicable law or related legal purposes.\nIf you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your identifiable personal data to provide you Slashdot Services, contact us at privacy@slashdotmedia.com.\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Who will receive your Personal Information:</strong> See \u201cHow we share information we gather\u2019.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data transfers to third countries:</strong> We provide our Sites and related services from the USA and may use service providers in various countries that do not provide the same level of data protection as is in your country.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Complaints:</strong> You have the right to make a complaint under the GDPR to your local data protection authority.\nOur e-mail address for complaints, requests or questions relating to this Privacy Notice is privacy@slashdotmedia.com</p>\n<p>Finally, we want to make it clear that nothing in this section is intended to limit any other right that applies to you under any other section of this Privacy Policy.</p>M.\nVisitors and Users of our Sites from Outside the United States<p>Canadian citizens, except under circumstances defined by law, are entitled to access their own Personal Information, to the extent covered by applicable law, collected by Slashdot by writing to: Slashdot Media, LLC dba

information upon verification of the omission or error and of the identity of the person requesting the change.</p>N.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy<p>We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices.\nIf we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on the Site prior to

our policy to respond promptly to claims of intellectual property misuse.\nOur procedures for responding to alleged copyright infringement are consistent with the form suggested by the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the text of which can be found at the U.S.\nCopyright Office web site https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf.\nPlease note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys\u2019 fees) if you make any material misrepresentations when making or countering a copyright infringement claim.</p>\n<p>If you believe that your work has been copied and is accessible on this site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, you may notify us by providing our copyright agent with the following information in writing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Slashdot Media to locate the material (e.g., URL).</li>\n<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Slashdot Media to contact you, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which you may be contacted.</li>\n<li>Include the following statement: \u201cI have a good faith belief that use of the material described above in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\u201d</li>\n<li>Include the following statement: \u201cThe information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\u201d</li>\n<li>A physical, electronic or digital signature, in a form reasonably acceptable to Slashdot Media, of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>\n<li>Send the written communication to the following contact:<br> Slashdot Media<br> PO Box 2452<br> La Jolla, CA 92038<br> Attention: Vice President Business Affairs &amp.\nGeneral Counsel.</li>\n<li>Send electronically-signed communication to dmca@slashdotmedia.com.\nA copy of your notice (with your personal contact information removed) may be forwarded to Chilling Effects (https://www.chillingeffects.org) for publication.\nA link to your published notice may also be displayed in our Site search results in place of the removed material.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>DMCA Counter-Notification Procedure: After receiving a notification of alleged infringement, Slashdot Media will remove or disable access to the material claimed to be infringing or claimed to be the subject of infringing activity.\nAt the same time, Slashdot Media will provide the project administrator(s) of the affected project or the provider of affected material with a copy of the notice.\nThe administrator of an affected project or the provider of affected material may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\nPlease be advised that you may be held liable for damages if you make material misrepresentations pursuant to federal law in the counter notification.\nWhen we receive a counter notification, we may reinstate the material in question.\nTo file a counter notification with us, the administrator of an affected site or the provider of affected material must provide a written communication (by postal mail, overnight mail, or, when digitally-signed, by email) that sets forth the items specified below.\n(A sample counter notification may be found at www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf.) To expedite our ability to process your counter notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Identify the material that Slashdot Media has removed or to which Slashdot Media has disabled access and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.</li>\n<li>Provide your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in San Diego, California (if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Slashdot Media may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the initial notification of infringement or an agent of such person.</li>\n<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit Slashdot Media to contact you, such as name, postal address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which you may be contacted.</li>\n<li>Include the following statement: \u201cI swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the removed material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\u201d</li>\n<li>Sign the paper or affix an electronic or digital signature to the communication in a form reasonably acceptable to Slashdot Media.</li>\n<li>Send written communication to the following address:<br>\nSlashdot Media<br>\nPO Box 2452<br>\nLa Jolla, CA 92038<br>\nAttention: Vice President Business Affairs &amp.\nGeneral Counsel.</li>\n<li>Send the written communication to the following contact:<br>\nSlashdot Media<br>\nPO Box 2452<br>\nLa Jolla, CA 92038<br>\nAttention: Vice President Business Affairs &amp.\nGeneral Counsel.</li>\n<li>Send electronically- or digitally-signed communication to dmca@slashdotmedia.com.\nUpon receipt of a counter notification in substantial compliance with the DMCA, Slashdot Media will provide the person who provided the initial notification of claimed infringement with a copy of the counter notification promptly.\nAfter receipt of the counter notification, Slashdot Media will generally replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it, unless Slashdot Media\u2019s designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the initial notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order regarding the removed material.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Slashdot Media is generally unable to evaluate the merits of trademark disputes because trademark rights may be based on registration or common law use, exist only for certain categories of goods or services and may differ internationally.\nTherefore, Slashdot Media expects you to resolve trademark disputes directly with the project administrator(s) rather than utilizing Slashdot Media as an intermediary.</p>10.\nMiscellaneous<p>This Agreement is entered into in the State of California and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, exclusive of its choice of law rules.\nEach party to this Agreement hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the County of San Diego in the State of California for any dispute arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the Site or any Site-related services, and waives any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.\nIn any action to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nIn the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.\nFailure of any party to insist upon strict compliance with any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any similar right or power at any subsequent time.\nSlashDot Media reserves the right to share or transfer personal information and aggregate information to a third party should SlashDot Media ever file for bankruptcy or in the event of a sale, merger, transfer or acquisition of all or a material part of the Company.\nIn addition, we may share your personal information with affiliated companies.</p>\n<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties

transferable or sub-licensable by you except with prior written consent.\nAny heading, caption or section title contained in this Agreement is inserted only as a matter of convenience and in no way defines or explains any section or provision hereof.\nThe Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to terminate the use of the Site by a user at any time.</p>\n<p>Please report any violations of the Terms (except for claims of intellectual property infringement) to the Site Director at sfnet_ops@slashdotmedia.com Slashdot Media may terminate a user\u2019s account in Slashdot Media\u2019s
