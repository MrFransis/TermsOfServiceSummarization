copyright?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Copyright is a form of protection for \u201coriginal works of authorship,\u201d including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic and other works, that are fixed in a tangible medium of expression.\nFor example, copyright protects published and unpublished books, poetry, plays, movies, music scores, song recordings, computer software, photographs, paintings, and drawings.\nCopyright does not protect facts, ideas, inventions, systems or methods of operation, but it may protect the way in which such things are expressed.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>When does copyright protection begin?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your work is protected by copyright from the moment you create the work and fix it in a tangible form.\nRegistration of a work with the United States Copyright Office is not required for protection in the United States, but it is generally required if you want to bring a lawsuit for infringement of your work in the United States.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>How long does a copyright last?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The term of protection for a copyright depends on a number of factors, including whether the work was published, the date of first publication of the work, where a work was first published and whether the work is anonymous, pseudonymous or a work made for hire.\nIn general, copyright protection for a work first published in the U.S.\nafter January 1, 1978 lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years from the date of death.\nFor a joint work that is authored by several people, copyright protection lasts for 70 years after the date of death of the last surviving author.\nThe copyright term for an anonymous or pseudonymous work or a work made for hire is 95 years from the date of first publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever expires first.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Do I own my work or article? Do I have the right to post my work or article on Academia.edu?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The answers to these questions will depend upon your particular situation.\nThe general rule is that the person who creates a work is the author and owner of the work.\nHowever, there are exceptions to that rule for works made for hire and for copyrights that have been transferred, assigned, willed or given to another party.\nFor example, copyright ownership of a paper written by a faculty member may be determined in several ways, including by a written agreement between the university and the faculty member or by the university\u2019s institutional policies on the ownership of copyrights for works created at the university and the allocation of royalties between the university and the author.\nIn addition, publishers frequently require authors to transfer their copyrights to the publishers as a condition of publication.\nThe transfer of ownership of a copyright to a publisher will prevent the author from future use of the work unless the author has agreed with the publisher that he or she reserves his or her right to use the work for certain purposes, such as teaching, research or other non-profit educational activities, or for certain types of use, such as rights to post an electronic version of the work on the faculty member\u2019s website or on websites like Academia.edu.\nMany journals will also allow an author to retain rights to all pre-publication drafts of his or her published work, which permits the author to post a pre-publication version of the work on Academia.edu.\nAccording to&nbsp;Sherpa, which tracks journal publishers' approach to copyright,&nbsp;90% of journals allow uploading of either the pre-print or the post-print of your paper.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>May I use someone else's work without getting permission?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In general, you should not use a copyright protected work without permission and, if you do so, the copyright owner may bring an infringement action against you.\nHowever, under the \u201cfair use\u201d doctrine in United States copyright law, there may be circumstances in which it is permissible to use limited portions of a work without permission, such as quoting part of a work, for purposes like commentary, criticism, news reporting, teaching, scholarship and research.\nWhether a particular use qualifies as a fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis depending on the specific circumstances of the use.\nThere are no rules that permit the use of a certain number of words or percentage of a work as a \u201cfair use.\u201d For more information about fair use, please see the U.S.\nCopyright Office\u2019s factsheet at https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/.</p> Definitions <br>\n<p>\n<strong>Who is an author?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The person who creates the original expression in a work is its author.\nThe author is also the owner of the copyright in a work unless the author assigned or transferred the copyright to another person or entity through a written agreement.\nFor works made for hire, the author is the employer or the party that commissioned the work.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>What is joint authorship?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A joint work is a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be combined into a single work.\nUnless the joint authors agree otherwise, each joint author has an equal and undivided ownership in the entire joint work and can exploit the work by granting licenses to third parties without permission from the other joint owners.\nEach joint author has a duty to account to the other joint owners for a share of any profits earned from his or her exploitation of the joint work.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>What is a work made for hire?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A work made for hire is either a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment or a statutorily defined category of work specially ordered or commissioned in a written agreement.\nThe author of a work made for hire is the employer of the person who created the work or the party that commissioned creation of the work.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>What is the public domain?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A work of authorship is said to be in the public domain if it is not protected by copyright law.\nA work may be in the public domain for a number of reasons, including publication prior to enactment of a copyright law, expiration of the copyright term or dedication of the work to the public domain by the copyright owner.\nWorks in the public domain may be used freely by anyone without permission.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-08-19 19:08:22.014032", "updated_at": "2021-08-19 19:08:32.407412"}, {"id": 71,

transmitted.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You and Academia.edu agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Site or Services (collectively, \u201c<strong>Disputes</strong>\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an \u201c<strong>IP Protection Action</strong>\u201d).\n(The actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) are the \u201c<strong>Litigable Actions.</strong>\u201d).\nWithout limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any Dispute other than a Litigable Action, if you provide Academia.edu with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at 580 California St, Suite 400, San Francisco, CA, 94104 within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an \u201c<strong>Arbitration Opt-out Notice</strong>\u201d).\nIf you don\u2019t provide Academia.edu with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except for Litigable Actions.\nThe exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Academia.edu with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, any Dispute other than an individual action brought in small claims court, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.&nbsp;Unless you timely provide CIR with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, <strong>you acknowledge and agree that you and Academia.edu are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding</strong>.&nbsp;Further, unless both you and Academia.edu otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</u> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Process.</u> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</u> Unless you and Academia.edu otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Academia.edu submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Arbitrator\u2019s Decision.</u> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nAcademia.edu will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Fees.</u> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Academia.edu will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<p>\n<u>Changes.</u> Notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cModification\u201d section above, if Academia.edu changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to feedback@academia.edu) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the \u201cLast Updated Date\u201d above or in the date of Academia.edu\u2019s email to you notifying you of such change.\nBy rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Academia.edu in accordance with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>General</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The failure of Academia.edu to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Academia.edu.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.\nIf for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Contacting
