in contract, tort, pursuant to statute, regulation, ordinance, or in equity or otherwise, wherever and by whomever commenced (\u201cClaim\u201d), shall, upon delivery of a written notice demanding arbitration to the other party (including a written notice after the commencement of a lawsuit or a notice contained in court filings in any such lawsuit), be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual (not class) basis only.&nbsp.\nSuch arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1&nbsp;et seq.&nbsp;(and not any state law concerning arbitration), these Terms, and the applicable rules of JAMS\u2013excluding any rules pertaining to class arbitration, and subject to any modifications of those rules by this Arbitration Agreement\u2013in effect at the time of the written notice demanding arbitration.&nbsp.\nIn the event of a conflict between JAMS rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.&nbsp.\nIn the event of a conflict between this Arbitration Agreement and another potentially applicable contractual arbitration provision, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrators shall not apply any arbitration provision other than this Arbitration Agreement in administering any arbitration concerning Claims falling within the scope of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.\nThe term \u201cClaim\u201d, as used in this Arbitration Agreement, is to be given the broadest possible meaning, and includes without limitation claims, disputes, or controversies arising from telephone, email, text or written communications from Coventry Direct or its affiliates, or qualifying your policy for possible purchase.&nbsp.\nAny dispute regarding arbitrability, including the permissibly of

consolidated arbitration shall be resolved in court and not in arbitration, regardless of the posture under which such disputes arise.&nbsp.\nYOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN ARBITRATION.&nbsp.\nDISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL GENERALLY ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS APPLICABLE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p>\n<p>THE

PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY.&nbsp.\nYOU AGREE THAT THERE SHALL BE NO CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM, AND YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>JAMS will be used for the purposes of administering an arbitration governed by this Arbitration Agreement.\nThe website containing applicable rules for JAMS is www.jamsadr.com.\nThe arbitration will be decided by one (1) arbitrator, who must be a lawyer with more than ten (10) years of experience or a retired judge.</p>\n<p>Arbitrations seeking relief less than $100,000 in the aggregate will be held within the federal judicial district encompassing the city where you reside.&nbsp.\nArbitrations seeking relief of $100,000 or more in the aggregate will be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>Coventry Direct will pay the first $2,500.00 in fees charged by the arbitration administrator for Claim(s) associated by you in the arbitration, after you have paid

arbitration of the name or other identifying information of any insured or policy owner.&nbsp.\nNor shall there be discovery in such arbitration of any trade secret, or any document or information pertaining to one or more transactions in which you were not directly involved.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Federal Rules of Evidence, except that in the event of a conflict between any of those rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.</p>\n<p>If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the other provisions of the Arbitration Agreement.\nprovided, however, that if the prohibition on classwide arbitration is deemed invalid or unenforceable\u2013an issue that may be considered only in a putative class proceeding\u2013then this entire Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Warranty
