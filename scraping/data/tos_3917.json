BY&nbsp;RISE BROADBAND</strong>\n</p>\n<p>1.0 DEDICATED INTERNET ACCESS SERVICE</p>\n<p>1.1 Description of Service: Dedicated Internet Access (\u201cDIA\u201d) Service (\u201cService\u201d), which includes Point to Point Licensed Spectrum Fixed Wireless, Point to Point Unlicensed Spectrum Fixed Wireless, Point to Multipoint Licensed Spectrum Fixed Wireless, Point to Multipoint Unlicensed

from the Customer Premises router to a port on the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Internet access network interface.\nService may accommodate special routing access requests by the Customer and/or by RISE BROADBAND.</p>\n<p>1.2 DIA Equipment and Maintenance: Service must terminate into a RISE BROADBAND-approved router on the customer premises (CPE).\nA CPE router is required for the exchange of traffic between the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Network and the Customer and may be furnished by Customer or provided by RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;at either no additional charge or for a monthly recurring fee, depending on the speed of Service.\nIf provided by RISE BROADBAND, RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;will maintain, manage and support all DIA Equipment, including all associated device configurations and operational usernames and passwords.\nCustomer must provide RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;with unrestricted access to RISE BROADBAND-provided DIA Equipment for purposes of testing, upgrading, and other maintenance activities.\nCustomer will provide continuous electrical service to RISE BROADBAND-provided DIA equipment.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp;will not be responsible for management of RISE BROADBAND-provided DIA Equipment if Customer has modified the DIA Equipment, including making any configuration changes.\nCustomers who choose to provide their own DIA routers will be solely responsible for all router maintenance, management, and support.\nIn addition, Customer must provide a single Layer-3 (IP) interface on Customer provided DIA router for the termination of Service.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp;will configure a single IP address on the single Layer-3 IP interface.\nMultiple Layer-3 or Layer-2 interfaces may not be used to connect directly to any single DIA Service circuit.</p>\n<p>1.3 DIA Service Demarcation: The point of demarcation for Service is the physical network location to which the Customer provided DIA router is connected or, if DIA Equipment is furnished by RISE BROADBAND, the LAN port at which interconnection takes place.\nCustomer will provide RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;with access to Customer\u2019s premises, as necessary, to facilitate Service installation, testing and maintenance requirements.</p>\n<p>1.4 Service Provisioning: If the Company, in its sole discretion, decides to provide via copper facilities acquired from a serving Local Exchange Carrier and subsequently ascertains that said facilities are unavailable for use, the Company may cancel the Service Order Agreement or Master Service Order Agreement without liability and without any further obligation to Customer.</p>\n<p>1.5 Service Use: Service use is limited to Customer and its End Users.</p>\n<p>1.6 Notices: Customer shall notify RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;within five (5) days of any information or notices served on Customer that might adversely affect RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;including, but not limited to, notices of any claims or proceedings that involve Service.\nIn addition, Customer shall promptly notify RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;of any errors, \u201cbugs,\u201d or Service problems of which Customer becomes aware when using Service.</p>\n<p>1.7 Disclaimers: RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;exercises no control over, and therefore accepts no responsibility for information or content passing through the Company\u2019s host computers, RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Network hubs and POPs (the \u201cRISE BROADBAND

DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp;expressly denies any responsibility for the accuracy or quality of information obtained by Customer or its End-Users through the use of Service.\nThe use of any information obtained via the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Network is at Customer\u2019s and End User\u2019s own risk.</p>\n<p>1.8 Term and Termination</p>\n<p>1.8.1 Service Commencement: RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;will notify Customer when: (a) Service is installed or connected, successfully tested, and available for Customer use.\nand (b) if RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;is installing DIA Equipment, that the DIA Equipment has been installed and is operational.\nBilling will begin on the Start of Service Date regardless of whether Customer is prepared to use Service.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp;shall not be liable for any damages of any nature resulting from delays in meeting requested or specified service dates or its inability to provide Service.</p>\n<p>1.8.2 Term: The minimum term of Service is one (1) year beginning on the Start of Service Date.\nUnless one Party notifies the other in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the original or any renewal term of Service that it intends not to renew Service, Service shall automatically renew for the same term of Service period at the same pricing, terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>1.9 Cancellation and Termination Charges.</p>\n<p>1.9.1 If Customer cancels Service after an order has been placed but before the Start of Service Date, Customer will (a) pay RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;one (1) month\u2019s monthly recurring charges for Service, plus any applicable service ordering and installation charges incurred by RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;in undertaking to provision Service, and (b) return, at Customer\u2019s expense, any RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;equipment in the same condition as when it initially was delivered and installed, reasonable wear and tear excepted, as well as any software or other materials provided by Company.</p>\n<p>1.9.2 If Customer terminates Service after the Start of Service Date, Customer must pay for all charges associated with the ordering and installation of Service, as well as the first month\u2019s recurring charges and for the monthly recurring charges for the remainder of the Service term, unless the Customer\u2019s termination is for cause.\nIn addition, Customer will return, at its expense, any RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;equipment in the same condition as when it initially was delivered and installed, reasonable wear and tear excepted, as well as any software or other materials provided by the Company.</p>\n<p>1.9.3 Customer agrees that the damages specified in Sections 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 are

Service Order and may vary depending on port speed, access costs or DIA Equipment costs required to deliver DIA Service to Customer.</p>\n<p>1.11.2 Committed Data Rate: If Customer selects a burstable Service and a minimum per Mbps data rate (\u201cCommitted Data Rate\u201d) applies to a particular IP port, Customer\u2019s per-port usage of Service (both Send Traffic and Receive Traffic) via such port will be sampled every five (5) minutes for the previous five (5) minute period.\nAt the end of each monthly billing period, the top five percent (5%) of Send Traffic and Receive Traffic samples for such port will be discarded.\nThe higher of the resulting ninety-fifth (95th) percentile value for Send Traffic or Receive Traffic for such port will be compared to the Committed Data Rate applicable to the port.\nIf the ninety-fifth (95th) percentile of either Send Traffic or Receive Traffic is higher than the applicable Committed Data Rate, Customer, in addition to being liable for the Committed Data Rate, will be liable for payment at the ninety-fifth (95th) percentile level for any usage in excess of the Committed Data Rate at the contracted per Mbps rate.\nFor the purposes of this Exhibit, \u201cReceive Traffic\u201d means traffic from any origination point that is received by Customer from the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;IP Network and \u201cSend Traffic\u201d means traffic from any origination point that is sent by Customer onto the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;IP Network.</p>\n<p>1.12 Service Level Agreement (\u201cSLA\u201d)</p>\n<p>1.12.1 Customer acknowledges it has reviewed the Service Level Agreement (\u201cSLA\u201d) located at http://www.risebroadband.com.\nSaid SLA, which may be amended from time to time, is incorporated by reference herein and is binding on RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;and Customer.</p>\n<p>1.13 Network Numbers and Domain Name Policies</p>\n<p>1.13.1 The RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Domain Name and TCP/IP Addresses provided in connection with Service remain the property of RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;and upon Service termination, Customer\u2019s right to use RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Domain Name and TCP/IP Addresses will cease.\nUnless otherwise mutually agreed in writing, Customer at all times is responsible for maintaining its own Domain Name when purchasing Service and for paying all charges associated with the Domain Name, including charges billed to Customer for Domain Name registration by third parties.</p>\n<p>1.13.2 RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;will have sole and exclusive discretion with regard to the Internet routing of RISE BROADBAND-provided IP addresses.</p>\n<p>1.14 Software License</p>\n<p>1.14.1 Customer will not reproduce, modify, translate, transform, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise determine, or attempt to determine, source code from any RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;or third party software, nor will it permit or authorize any third party to do so.\nTitle to such software, and all related technical know-how and

SOFTWARE.\nCUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND ACCEPTS ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SOFTWARE MEETING CUSTOMER\u2019S REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS.</p>\n<p>1.15 Limitation of Liability</p>\n<p>1.15.1 NEITHER PARTY

that RISE has the right to change its Service fees, additional fees, or add new fees at any time, upon notice to the USER.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if USER agrees to a Service plan with a

to comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Service plan originally agreed to.\nBilling cycle and Service Term will recommence upon activation of RISE Service at the new

RISE technician confirms and verifies that RISE is not able to provide service to the new address or (ii) USER provides proof and RISE confirms that the new location is outside of RISE\u2019s service area (i.e.\ncopy of utility bill at new address).</p>\n<p>If RISE has not received sufficient information from USER to process the relocation order thirty (30) days after Service termination date, this Agreement shall be considered terminated by USER, and any applicable Early Termination Fees will apply.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>PRIVACY </u>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>RISE takes USER\u2019s personally identifiable information and privacy seriously and has established a Privacy Policy which governs its collection, use, disclosure, management and security related to USER\u2019s personal

intervals, RISE BROADBAND Network equipment is polled to identify what devices may be experiencing congestion.\n&nbsp;When a specific device is determined to be congested, the subscribers serviced from that/those network device(s) are analyzed and then managed based on plan and usage thresholds until the congestion has been alleviated, as described more fully below.\n&nbsp;Subscribers will still be able to do what they want online.\nin many cases activities may be unaffected.\n&nbsp;In other cases, subscribers may see reduced speed in downloads or uploads.\n&nbsp;No specific type of usage activity or subscriber aggregate monthly usage is targeted by these practices.\n&nbsp;It is important to note that RISE BROADBAND Network management is temporary and based on constantly changing network conditions.</p>\n<p>The network management practices described in this section are part of the \u201cstandard\u201d RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Network architecture.\n&nbsp;As RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;acquires other broadband Internet networks, we implement these practices as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>A.\n<u>Blocking</u>: Other than reasonable network management practices disclosed below, we do not block or otherwise prevent a subscriber from accessing lawful content, applications, services, or your use of non-harmful devices.</p>\n<p>B.\n<u>Throttling</u>: Other than reasonable network management practices disclosed below, we do not throttle or otherwise shape, slow, degrade or impair a subscriber from accessing lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, user, or use of a non-harmful device.\nAll lawful Internet use is handled identically.</p>\n<p>C.\n<u>Affiliated Prioritization</u>: We do not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, to benefit any of our affiliates, defined as an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with RISE BROADBAND.</p>\n<p>D.\n<u>Paid Prioritization</u>: We do not directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, in exchange for consideration, monetary or otherwise.</p>\n<p>E.\n<u>Congestion Management</u>: Our Services are provided on a \u201cbest efforts\u201d basis and our congestion management practices are in place to ensure that all subscribers experience as high quality a service.\nIf our Network experiences congestion, it is typically between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm local time.&nbsp.\nSubscribers select how much high-speed data they receive under a designated service plan.&nbsp.\nIf a subscriber exceeds his/her/its selected high-speed allotment during a service cycle, we may reduce the subscriber\u2019s data speed for the remainder of that service cycle.&nbsp.\nWe do not impose any additional usage limits for the Services unless part of our network management practices.</p>\n<p>In a manner consistent with our Service Agreements and Privacy Policy, we may monitor network traffic to ensure capacity is sufficient to maintain an efficient network load, to perform diagnostics and to otherwise manage and enhance the RISE BROADBAND Networks.&nbsp.\nTo help manage traffic on the RISE BROADBAND Networks, during times of high demand, we may allocate available bandwidth among subscribers on an equal basis, by account level.&nbsp.\nIn addition, we may prioritize certain applications, such as public safety and voice, over other traffic types.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>i.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp.\ndeploys three types of \u201cfair queuing\u201d as a network management tool when congestion is present in RISE BROADBAND Networks, including (a) \u201cfair split\u201d where all users on a device get a fair share of bandwidth.\n(b) \u201cfair factor\u201d which allows for users on different service plans to get a proportion of bandwidth based on their plan (i.e.\na 5Mbps user will get less bandwidth than a 50Mbps user).\nor (c) \u201cborrowing\u201d where RISE BROADBAND prioritizes types of traffic to deliver a higher quality of experience (i.e.\nVoIP has priority over streaming and streaming has priority over bulk file transfers/downloads).\nNo traffic type is completely denied access.</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>ii.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp;may also use specific traffic shaping software in order to manage our Network during periods of congestion.</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>iii.\nRISE BROADBAND&nbsp;may also conduct deep packet inspection (\u201cDPI\u201d), which is a type of filtering that will examine the data and/or header part of Internet traffic for viruses, spam, intrusions, or protocol non-compliance that may harm a RISE BROADBAND Network.\nto determine the routing of Internet traffic.\nfor internal statistical and performance purposes.\nfor lawful intercept capabilities, and/or enforcement of our Service Agreements.\nWe do not use DPI to conduct data mining for targeted marketing or advertising, or anti-competitive purposes.</li>\n<li>\n</li>\n<li>iv.\nIf RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;determines, in our sole and reasonable discretion, that the manner in which a subscriber is using the service negatively impacts other subscribers or any RISE BROADBAND Network, we reserve the right to apply additional congestion management techniques.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Application-Specific Behavior</u>: Subject to the qualification that RISE BROADBAND may reasonably limit or rate-control specific or classes of applications, or other specific protocols or protocol ports as set forth below, RISE BROADBAND generally treats all lawful applications identically.\nHowever, we reserve the right to block or limit access to any applications, ports, or protocols that we determine, in our sole and reasonable discretion, may expose any RISE BROADBAND Network to potential legal liability, harm any RISE BROADBAND Network or otherwise interfere with or impair the experience of other subscribers on RISE BROADBAND Networks.&nbsp.\nRISE BROADBAND Networks also may not support certain high-bandwidth video and voice applications, or peer-to-peer applications that carry unlawful or harmful content/software.</p>\n<p>G.\n<u>Device Attachment Rules</u>: Generally, you do not need approval to connect a third-party device to a RISE BROADBAND Network.\nRISE BROADBAND does not limit the types of devices that can be connected to any RISE BROADBAND Networks, provided they are used for lawful purposes and do not harm a RISE BROADBAND Network, violate our Service Agreements, or harm other users of RISE BROADBAND Networks.\nHowever, if we determine, in our sole and reasonable discretion, that the connection of a particular type of device to any RISE BROADBAND Network negatively impacts other users or the RISE BROADBAND Network, or may expose us to potential legal liability, we reserve the right to limit or restrict subscribers\u2019 ability to connect such type of device to RISE BROADBAND Networks.\n&nbsp;If you need technical support services to assist you in the installation and configuration of third party devices, please contact us or visit https://www.risebroadband.com/support/.&nbsp.\nDepending on your level of service and your specific Service Agreement, there may be an additional monthly fee for our IT support services.</p>\n<p>H.&nbsp;<u>Security</u>: RISE BROADBAND has taken reasonable physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the integrity and operations of RISE BROADBAND Networks and our subscribers from malicious and unwanted Internet traffic.\nWe monitor the RISE BROADBAND Network for security threats and may prohibit certain activity on RISE BROADBAND Networks that we may deem, in our sole and reasonable discretion, poses a potential risk to any RISE BROADBAND Network and/or to other subscribers.&nbsp.\nTriggering conditions include but are not limited to denial of service activity, IP address or port scanning, excessive account login failures.\nor certain Internet addresses that are disruptive, malicious and typically persistent.&nbsp.\nIf we notice excessive subscriber connections, including but not limited to Wi-Fi connections, that are harmful or are commonly used to disrupt the normal use of any RISE BROADBAND Network or use by other subscribers, we will attempt to notify the subscriber to work collaboratively to remedy the issue to the extent possible.\nhowever, we reserve the right as a reasonable security practice, without advance notice, to block any subscriber traffic, ports, protocols, devices, or applications (such as peer-to-peer applications that may carry malicious software or are known to be problematic) that we determine, in our sole and reasonable discretion, may cause harm to any RISE BROADBAND Network or to other subscribers, or may expose us to potential legal liability.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;II.&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS AND COMMERCIAL TERMS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Specific service fees and rates for an individual subscriber are set

</strong>RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;subscriptions include a specific amount of monthly Internet data usage (up and down transfer) as specified in each subscriber\u2019s service plan.\nIf usage exceeds the threshold, additional charges will apply.\n&nbsp;Charges will be based on usage (up and down transfer) in 10 GB increments.\n&nbsp;10 GB increments will be billed after the first bit of usage over the subscription threshold.\n&nbsp;Additional 10 GB increments will be billed as usage dictates.</p>\n<p>Subscribers will be notified when they have hit certain usage thresholds.\n&nbsp;Email notification will be sent to the subscriber at the following events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>i.\n75% of subscription usage has been consumed</li>\n<li>ii.\n95% of subscription usage has been consumed</li>\n<li>iii.\nEvery time a new 10 GB increment has been purchased</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to email notification, subscribers can also track their usage online at their My Account page.</p>\n<p>D.\n<u>Network Speeds</u>: RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;offers a range of download speeds to residential subscribers varying from 5 Mbps to 50 Mbps.&nbsp.\nThe network is designed to support these speeds to help ensure that every subscriber receives the speeds to which they have subscribed.\n&nbsp;RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;however cannot guarantee speeds at all times, as there are many factors and conditions beyond RISE BROADBAND\u2019s control that can affect Internet performance.\n&nbsp;Some of these external factors and conditions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>i.\nPerformance of subscriber computer and/or router</li>\n<li>ii.\nType of connection to RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Customer Premise Equipment (i.e., Wi-Fi)</li>\n<li>iii.\nCongestion of web sites and services on Internet</li>\n<li>iv.\nWeb site or service limiting speeds on the Internet</li>\n<li>v.\nInternet and equipment performance outside of the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Network</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Internet packages are advertised as \u201cup to\u201d certain speeds reflecting performance under ideal conditions.\n&nbsp;Without purchasing an expensive \u201cdedicated\u201d Internet connection, no Internet Service Provider can guarantee package speeds at all times.</p>\n<p>RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;provides a Speed Test for our subscribers to use.\n&nbsp;While the test results on this site provide information regarding service speeds, they are not definitive as they are highly dependent on equipment and configuration found in the home network.\n&nbsp;Additional information regarding subscriber experience across RISE BROADBAND Internet Plans can be found at our&nbsp;FAQ&nbsp;page.\n&nbsp;This page displays mean subscriber speeds and latency information by Internet plan.\n&nbsp;Subscriber speed tests are collected from the RISE BROADBAND&nbsp;Speed Test servers identified above.\n&nbsp;These results are calculated by averaging all subscriber speed tests and latency, by plan, at peak periods of usage.\n&nbsp;Peak periods of usage are defined as 7:00 pm to 11:00 pm on weeknights.</p>\n<p>E.&nbsp;<u>Impact of Non-Broadband Internet Access Service Data Services (also known as \u201cSpecialized
