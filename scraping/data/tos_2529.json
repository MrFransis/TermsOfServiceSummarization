as described in this section.\nOur free Services are supported by advertising.&nbsp;</em>\n<em>As more fully described&nbsp;below, in order to monetize our free, ad-supported Services, we work with third parties to display advertising on the Services.&nbsp;</em>\n<em>Our subscription websites are paid for by subscription fees, and are ad-free, as are our paid-for mobile applications.&nbsp;</em>\n<em>If you would like to avoid all advertisements, sign up for a subscription or upgrade your mobile application.&nbsp;</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>&nbsp;</em>\n</p>\n<p>We work with DigiTrust to set a cookie in your browser to enable us and&nbsp;DigiTrust Partners to collect web viewing data that includes visits to a Britannica Service and other non-affiliated websites over time.\nThis data may be used to infer whether you share interests with other Users and deliver advertising relevant to those inferences.\nThis type of advertising is called interest-based or behavioral advertising.\nYou can exercise choice about the collection of data in this way for interest-based, behavioral advertising by visiting the&nbsp;Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s choice page&nbsp;and opting out from DigiTrust or use one of the links provided below.\nOpting out from DigiTrust will stop DigiTrust Partners from using the DigiTrust identifier.\nThrough the DAA choice page, you may make other choices for companies that participate in the DAA, some of which are DigiTrust Partners.</p>\n<p>Our ad-supported Services also rely on third-party service providers to do things like: take user-level information, anonymize it through hashing (a hashed email address might look something like this: <strong>e820bb4aba5ad74c5a6ff1aca16641f6</strong>) and match it against other anonymized, people-based identifiers \u2013 doing this helps us serve you personalized, relevant advertisements.&nbsp.\nSpecifically, when you use our ad-supported Services, we may share information that we may collect from you, including your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our third-party service providers, Index Exchange (IX) and LiveRamp Inc.\nand its group companies (\u2018LiveRamp\u2019).\nIX and LiveRamp may use our first party cookie on your browser to match your shared information to their marketing databases in order to provide back a pseudonymous privacy-centric identifier for our use in real time bidding in digital advertising.\nThese third parties may in turn link further demographic or interest-based information to your browser.\nYou have the choice to opt-out of the use of your data by third-party service providers for this purpose at any time.&nbsp.\nPlease find more information about opting out below.</p>\n<p>Please note that limiting third-party cookies via your browser controls does not prevent our first-party cookies from being set in this way.\nAlso, please know, if you opt-out of interest-based advertising <u>you will continue to receive ads on our free, ad-supported Services, but not behaviorally targeted ads</u>.\nAlso, if you opt-out of Britannica\u2019s practices, you may continue to receive interest-based advertising through other companies.&nbsp.\nIf you erase your browser\u2019s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Anonymous&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>data</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anonymous aggregated data may be provided to other companies we do business with for statistical

third-party partners.\nthat usage is governed by the advertiser\u2019s or third party partner\u2019s privacy policy.</p>\n<p>What does it mean to \u201cserve ads\u201d? When you visit a website, your Internet browser transmits a \u201crequest\u201d to the computer that hosts the website (the \u201chost server\u201d) requesting that server to send you (or \u201cserve\u201d) the Web page that you are seeking.\nMost Web pages contain components that are pulled from different sources, for example, a Web page at a news site may get its weather section from one provider, its sports results from a different source, and advertisements from other servers.\nOur Web pages contain coding that directs your browser to fill the ad spaces on the Web pages with content served by advertisers and networks of advertisers to whom we have sold the ad spaces.\nThe advertisers and networks use cookies and beacons to help manage ad delivery and frequency and to identify audience segment(s) for customized advertising (\u201ctargeting\u201d).\nThese cookies are used to identify your IP address, so that when you visit another website using the same advertising network, the network will recognize the cookie as one of its own, read the information on the cookie (the record of which sites in the network you have visited) and serve you an ad that you might be interested in, based on your past visits to other sites in the network.\nAdvertising targeted based on past Web surfing is known as \u201cbehavioral advertising.\u201d</p>\n<p>Britannica does not provide any personal information to third-party advertisers about visitors to the Services.\nOur Privacy Notice does not cover the use of information that they may have collected from you by third parties on other sites.\nIf you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org.\nMany of the same companies are members of the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nYou can learn more and opt-out of receiving targeted ads from them at http://www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>\n<p>Some advertising networks require that we specifically list their opt-out links below.\nWhen you opt-out of a network, you may receive a \u201copt-out\u201d cookie so that the network will know not to assign you new cookies in the future.\n<u>You will continue to receive ads from that network, but not behaviorally targeted ads</u>.\nIf you erase your browser\u2019s cookies, you may need to perform this process again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exponential Interactive, Inc.\nhas a legitimate interest to collect

contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content

\u201cDo Not Track\u201d (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time.\nHowever, since no technology

note to minors:</strong>&nbsp;If you are under the age of 16, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian or school before using the Services.\nIf we discover that we have collected any personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 16 without the proper consents required by law, we will suspend the associated account and/or remove that information from our database as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Britannica does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under 16, except as permitted by law or otherwise provided herein.\nIf we discover we have received any information from a child under 16 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.\nIf you believe Britannica has any information from or about anyone under 16, please email us at privacy@eb.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Student Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a student with access to our Institutional Services through an Institutional Subscription License Agreement between your school institution and us, your student service data is processed in a way that is COPPA- and FERPA-compliant.<strong>&nbsp.\n</strong>As you use this site, you will enter student data or interact with student data that has already been entered.\nUnder the terms of our contracts with school institutions, we agree to act as a \u201cSchool Official\u201d as defined by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), meaning that we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees;</li>\n<li>Have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school\u2019s or district\u2019s annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records;</li>\n<li>Are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records.\nand</li>\n<li>Use education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-disclose from education records to other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records.\nTo help your school district comply with FERPA, we have adopted certain practices, and require that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data.</p>\n<p>The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Student Data Security &amp.\nConfidentiality Statement</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Purposes of Data Entry</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You control what student data is entered on this site and you retain ownership of the student data at all times.\nStudent data entered on this site should be limited to information that is relevant to the legitimate educational purpose of improving student performance.\nWe will not ask you to enter, and you are instructed not to enter, data about students that is not relevant to this legitimate educational purpose.</p>\n<p>Therefore, only a minimum amount of personally identifiable student data required for the setup of the system is requested.\nAdditional data, not specific to the student, is also required to complete system setup, including the teacher first and last name, class name, grade level, and school name.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Use, Disclosure, and Storage</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We will use the student data to provide the services to your school institution.\nWe will not keep the student data after you or the school district instructs us to delete it.</p>\n<p>We will only disclose student data to authorized employees or representatives of the school institution, and will not knowingly disclose the student data to any third person without express written authorization.\nWhen, at the request of the school institution, we acquire assessment or other information, including personally identifiable student data, from a third party source we treat that information with the same confidentiality and security safeguards as though it were provided directly by the school institution.\nAdditional agreements may be required by the third party to authorize transmission of data to us.</p>\n<p>Your school institution may from time to time request that we provide student data to third parties of its choosing.\nWe will do so with written authorization, which acknowledges that we are providing that data as the requesting institution\u2019s agent and that once the data is received by the third party, we no longer has any control over the use or disposition of the data.</p>\n<p>We may also use aggregated data in our research, product development, and marketing.\nThat aggregated, non-personally identifiable data (e.g., summary or statistical data) may be shared with third parties.\nHowever, we do not use personally identifiable student data to market any products or services directly to students or their parents.</p>\n<p>In the event that we wish, from time to time, to release aggregated data that identifies a school or school district by name, we will enter into a separate agreement with the institution to authorize release and publication.</p>\n<p>We do not utilize third parties to provide products and do not share your student data with any third parties.</p>\n<strong>Security&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>of Your Information</strong>\n<p>Any personally identifiable information collected through this site is stored on limited-access servers.\nWe will maintain safeguards to protect these servers and the information they store.&nbsp.\nIn addition, to help protect the privacy of data and personally identifiable information you transmit through use of our Services, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards.\nWe update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis.\nWe strive to restrict access to your personal data to those employees who need to know that information to provide benefits or services to you.\nIn addition, we strive to all our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your information.</p>\n<strong>Data Storage and Retention</strong>\n<p>Your personal data is stored by us on our servers located in the United States, Australia and India.&nbsp.\nWe retain your information for the duration of your business relationship with us and as long as necessary to permit us to use
