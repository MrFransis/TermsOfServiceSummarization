MONITORING THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF THEIR STUDENTS AND MUST THEREFORE TAKE SPECIAL CARE WHEN REVIEWING THIS PRIVACY POLICY.\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND EDUCATORS SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OBTAINING, WHERE APPLICABLE, PERTINENT CONSENT FROM PARENTS, LEGAL GUARDIANS OR ELIGIBLE STUDENTS (THOSE WHO ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR ATTEND A POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTION) PRIOR TO UTILIZING THE SERVICE.\nBLOOKET SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY NEGLIGENCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION IN THE REVIEWING OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR THE OBTAINMENT, WHERE APPLICABLE, OF THE NECESSARY PARENTAL CONSENT.\nU.S.\nEducational Institutions and Parental Consent: Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, if you or your school decide to utilize the Service with children under 13, you will be electing to either obtain parental consent or to consent on behalf of the children's parents directly, which is commonly referred to as \"school consent.\" At the same time, yet subject to exceptions, FERPA prohibits schools from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education record to a third party without written consent from the parent or eligible student.\nAccordingly, schools must either obtain parental consent, or ensure that their use of Blooket meets one of FERPA's exceptions to the written consent requirement.\nTypically, schools are exempted from obtaining parental consent under FERPA when Blooket is identified as a \"school official,\" meaning Blooket is performing an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use its own employees.\nEducators and schools may disclose certain information about students under the exception to FERPA's general prior consent rule that are set forth in the statute and the regulations for the disclosure of \"directory information\" if the school follows certain procedures set forth in FERPA.\n(34 CFR \u00a7 99.31(a)(11).) FERPA defines \"directory information\" as information contained in the education records of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.\nTypically, \"directory information\" includes information such as name, address, telephone listing, date and place of birth, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, and dates of attendance.\nA school may disclose \"directory information\" to third parties without consent if it has given public notice of the types of information which it has designated as \"directory information,\" the parent's or eligible student's right to restrict the disclosure of such information, and the period of time within which a parent or eligible student has to notify the school in writing that he or she does not want any or all of those types of information designated as \"directory information.\" The means of notification could include publication in various sources, including a newsletter, in a local newspaper, or in the student handbook.\nThe school could also include the \"directory information\" notification as part of the general notification of rights under FERPA.\nThe school does not have to notify a parent or eligible student individually.\nEuropean Educational Institutions and GDPR: According to article 8 of the GDPR, minors shall be entitled to give valid consent only if they are 16 years old (unless Member States have set a lower age limit which, nonetheless, cannot be under 13 years old).\nUnder that age limit, processing of personal information related to minors shall be subject to parental consent.\nSchools are in control of their students\u2019 personal information and are obliged to take all necessary measures for protecting said information.\nThis means that schools will have to be especially cautious when contracting any service that may require disclosure of student personal information.\nIn other words, schools are data controllers in terms of GDPR and thus determine the purposes and means of the processing of student personal data.\nAs a consequence, schools will also be responsible for informing students and their parents accordingly about what data is collected, which are the purposes of collection, how data is used and to which third parties it is disclosed, including Blooket.\nLegitimate Interests Generally, the remainder of the processing of personal information we perform is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of third parties.\nFor example, for legal compliance purposes or to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of Blooket's systems, website, and overall services, we must keep logs of Technical Information.\nAs foreseen in the \"Restrictions\" and \"Account Bans'' sections of our Terms of Service, the breach of certain rules in the use of the Service may lead to the suspension or indefinite ban of your account, depending on the severity of the offense.\nIn the event of an indefinite account ban, Blooket may keep part of your personal information, such as, but not limited to, IP address and email address, to prevent you from accessing or using the Service.\nNotice of Changes of Policy We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.\nYou can see when the last update was by looking at the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the top of this page.\nWe will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.\nIf we make any significant changes, we will provide prominent notice by posting a notice on the Service and/or notifying you by email (using the email address you provided) prior to and after changes taking effect, so you can review and make sure you're aware of them.\nWe encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time, to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information through the Service.\nIf you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may delete your account (although we will be sad to see you go!).\nBy continuing to use the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to the current version of the Privacy Policy.\nProtecting the Privacy Rights of Children Blooket permits registered users to invite visitors to the website.\nVisitors are only required to provide a username to play a game or complete a homework assignment.\nBlooket permits children under the age of thirteen to become users only with parental consent.\nBlooket collects the minimal amount of information from users necessary to create accounts on our Service.\nBeyond this information, users and visitors can submit responses.\nIn addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the \"Information Collected Automatically\" section.\nWe use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, or as required by law or to enforce our Terms.\nWe will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service.\nIf we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, FERPA or any other applicable laws or regulations, we will take appropriate steps to delete the information.\nWe do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to service providers necessary to provide the Service, as required by law, or to protect the security of the Service or other users.\nInformation collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is never used or disclosed for third-party advertising, including any kind of first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children\u2019s personal information is never sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.\nBlooket does not permit children under the age of 13 (a \u201cChild\u201d or \u201cChildren\u201d) to create an account without the consent and at the direction of a Parent or School official consenting in loco parentis.\nChildren under 13 may create an account with the parent's consent.\nWhen Blooket is used by a School in an educational setting, we may rely on the School to provide the requisite consent for Blooket to collect information from a School User under the age of 13, in lieu of parental consent.\nInformation regarding Children No student\u2019s profile is made available or visible to the public, or to any other students, through Blooket.\nIf the teacher chooses to display Blooket in their classroom by projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard, students physically present in that classroom may see other students\u2019 usernames, responses, comments or total scores.\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND TEACHERS SHALL MAKE A RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE SERVICE AND AVOID COMPROMISING CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES WHEN DISPLAYING BLOOKET IN THE CLASSROOM.\nBLOOKET SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF THE SERVICE BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OR THE TEACHER.\nStorage of Data We store the data of visitors including usernames in order to allow users to evaluate the homework or evaluate participation in games.\n<ul>\n<li> Minimal information: As mentioned before, Blooket collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to utilize our Service: we ask student who are invited to play the games or participate in homework to only create a username.\nStudents who join as users with parental consent or who are above specified ages only provide names, email addresses and usernames.\nConsistent with the requirements of FERPA and COPPA in the United States and of GDPR in Europe, among other applicable laws, we only collect, use, share, and retain student personal information for purposes for which we were authorized by the educational institution/agency, teacher or the student.\nBeyond this information, students can submit responses depending on the activities they are assigned, that will remain private between teacher and student.\nIn addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the \"Information collected automatically\" section.\n</li>\n<li>Deleting inactive accounts: Blooket will delete inactive accounts and data in compliance with the data retention policy of the company.</li>\n</ul> After deletion of the account or data, Blooket may retain copies and/or backups of the mentioned information for a maximum term of eighteen (18) months.\nNevertheless, Blooket shall not be responsible for the accidental loss or destruction of data on behalf of users.\nBlooket will not be obliged to recover erased data stored in backups when erasure is attributable to users.\nEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING THE SERVICE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLYING WITH THE RETENTION OF STUDENT EDUCATION RECORDS FOR AS LONG AS LEGALLY APPLICABLE.\nSTUDENT PROGRESS MAY BE SAVED FOR EITHER SHORTER OR LONGER PERIODS THAN THE ONES STATED ABOVE IF SO DECIDED BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION.\nTEACHER ACCOUNTS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH NECESSARY TOOLS TO MANAGE AND DELETE STUDENT INFORMATION.BLOOKET SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ERASURE OF STUDENT PROGRESS DUE TO ACCOUNT DELETION AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF INACTIVITY OR BECAUSE OF THE VOLUNTARY ELECTION TO DELETE TEACHER ACCOUNTS.\nSCHOOL OFFICIALS MAY REQUEST DELETION OF STUDENT INFORMATION AND CONTENT AT ANY TIME BY CONTACTING BLOOKET AT CONTACT-US@BLOOKET.COM.\nParental Choices Any parents that want copies of their children\u2019s personal information that we may have stored can contact their children\u2019s school personnel to that end.\nIf a parent has authorized an account, they also may contact Blooket to retrieve their child\u2019s personal information.\nAt any time, the school can also refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from its students, and can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from them by contacting us at contact-us@Blooket.com.\nPlease keep in mind that deleting records may require us to terminate the account in question.\nAlso remember that before we can share the information with the school, or delete it per your request, we will, by reasonable means, proceed to verify the identity of the requester.\nInformation Collected Blooket collects two types of information about you: (1) information that you voluntarily provide us by using the Blooket Service (described below under \"Information you provide to us\") and (2) information collected automatically as result of your use of the Service (described below under \u201cInformation collected automatically\u201d).\nThe types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a visitor to the site invited to participate in a game.\nOnly minimal information is collected for both users and visitors Information You Provide to UsThere are currently two categories of users on our Service: users and visitors.\nWe collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:<ul>\n<li> Account Sign-up and Profile Information: To create a Blooket account, you may be asked to provide some basic information.\nIf you create an Blooket account as a user, you will be asked to enter your first name, last name, username, password and email.\nVisitors who participate in games will be asked only for a username.\n</li>\n<li> Contact Information: When you choose to provide us with your personal information through the Service in some other manner (e.g., when you request a quote for upgrading to a \"Blooket Plus\", when you submit a copyright claim or report any media on our platform, when you send us an email asking a question, or submit a support request).\n</li>\n<li> Billing Information: When subscribing to any of our \"Blooket Plus\" options, you will be asked to provide necessary information for processing the payment (e.g., credit/debit card number).\nAs further explained in the Security Measures section of this Privacy Policy, payments are processed over Stripe through their third party website service.\n</li>\n</ul>Information Collected Automatically Like most web-based services, we (or our service providers) may automatically receive and log information on our server logs from your browser or your device when you use the Service.\nFor example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to Blooket.\nIf you use Blooket on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices.\nIf we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy.\nThe technologies and information we automatically collect include: <ul>\n<li> Cookies and Other Similar Technologies: We (or our service providers) may use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our Service, including clear GIFs (also known as \u201cweb beacons\u201d), \u201ctags\u201d, \u201cscripts\u201d, and \u201ccookies\u201d.\nWe also make use of persistent secure cookies: persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (although they can be removed) and may be used by your browser to identify you on subsequent visits to the Service.\nWe may also use, collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5).\nLike many services, Blooket uses these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.\n</li>\n<li> Device Information: We collect, through our third-party analytics services, device-specific information such as your operating system, hardware version, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers.\nThis helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve Blooket for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you\u2019ve opted in to receive them.\n</li>\n<li> Log Information: Like most online services, when you use our Service, we automatically collect and store certain information in our server logs.\nExamples include: </li>\n<ul>\n<li>Details of how you used our service, such as your activity on the Service, and the frequency and duration of your visits to the Blooket Website.</li>\n<li>IP Address.</li>\n<li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul> This information helps us make decisions about what we should work on next - for example, by showing which features are most (or least!) popular.\n<ul>\n<li> Location Information: When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi signals.\nWe collect coarse (i.e., city-level) location data.\nWe will not store or track your device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission.\nWe do not share precise geolocation data with third parties, other than our service providers as necessary to provide the Service.\n</li>\n</ul>Automated Decision Making and Profiling Automated Decision Making (ADM) refers to a decision which is taken solely on the basis of automated processing of your personal data.\nThis means processing using, for example, software code or an algorithm, which does not require human intervention.\nProfiling means using automated processes without human intervention (such as computer programs) to analyze your personal information in order to evaluate your behavior or to predict things about you which are relevant in the context of using Blooket, such as what kind of games or Blooket sets you utilized.\nAs profiling uses automated processing, it is sometimes connected with automated decision-making.\nNot all profiling results in automated decision-making, but it can.\nUse of Information by Blooket First and foremost, you should know that Blooket does not sell or rent any personal information to any third party for any purpose including for advertising or marketing purposes.\nWe use the information we collect from you to provide you with the best Blooket experience.\nMore specifically, this information is used to: <ul>\n<li>Provide and improve the Service, for example by developing new products and features.</li>\n<li>Respond to your requests for information or customer support.</li>\n<li>Customize the Service for you, and improve your experience with it.</li>\n<li>Send you information about new features and Blooket products we believe you may be interested in.</li>\n<li>Most crucially, to protect our community by making sure the Service remains safe and secure.</li>\n</ul> We use automatically collected information (described in the \"Information Collected Automatically\" section above) to provide and support our Service, and for the additional uses described in this section of our Privacy Policy.\nStorage of Data We store your personal information for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, including those described above pursuant to our Data Retention Policy.\nDeletion will affect any on-going paid subscriptions, which will be immediately cancelled.\nNote we may retain and use de-identified data (i.e., data which has been stripped off all information that can be used to identify a person) for purposes of research, improvement of our products and services, and/or the development of new products and services.\nWe may also have to retain some information after your account is deleted, to comply with legal obligations, to protect the safety and security of our community or our Service, or to prevent abuse of our Terms.\nIn case we keep copies or backups of personal information, such copies or backups will be kept for a maximum term of eighteen (18) months after the deletion of your account.\nSecurity Measures First and foremost, you should know that Blooket does not sell or rent your, or your students' personal information to any third party for any purpose - including for advertising or marketing purposes.\nFurthermore, we do not share personal information with any third parties except in the limited circumstances described in this Privacy Policy.\nNo student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service.\nFurthermore, students cannot share their account information with anyone on Blooket.\nIf you are a user, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other Blooket users - for example, things like your account information or Blooket sets.\nPlease keep in mind that information (including personal information or children's personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including other Blooket users you interact with through the Service can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with.\nWe cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information.\n<ul>\n<li> Service Providers: We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf - we can\u2019t build everything ourselves, after all! We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security.\nGenerally, these service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.\nAdditionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n<li> Analytics Services: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used.\nThese services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded.\n</li>\n<li> Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information: We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly, including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how Blooket is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for Blooket.\nAny aggregated information shared this way will not contain any personal information.\n</li>\n<li> Legal Requirements: We may disclose personal information if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process.\nWe may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Blooket, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our Terms of Service or other agreements.\nThis includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection or responding to government requests.\n</li>\n<li> Sharing with Blooket Companies: Over time, Blooket may grow and reorganize.\nWe may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners or other companies that we control or that are under common control by us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n<li> Change of Control: In the event that all or a portion of Blooket or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third party, personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third party.\nThis Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).\nWe will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, and by email to your email address that you provided to us.\nIf you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, you may request its deletion from the company.\nIn the unlikely event that Blooket goes out of business, or files for bankruptcy, we will protect your personal information, and will not sell it to any third party.\n</li>\n<li> With your Consent: Other than the cases above, we won\u2019t disclose your personal information for any purpose unless you consent to it.\nAdditionally, as discussed above, we will never sell or rent your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.\n</li>\n</ul>Do Not Track Blooket does not track its users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.\nBlooket's Third-Party Service Providers It is important to us that we keep your information safe and secure.\nTo best provide our services, and keep your information safe, we work with a few other companies (we can\u2019t do it all ourselves!).\nThese
