privacy is extremely important to us.\nBelow is our Privacy Policy, which explains what personal information we collect and how we use that information.\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>What this Privacy Policy Covers<p>This Privacy Policy covers the use of the website located at educreations.com (the \"Site\") and the products, software, data feeds, and services (collectively with the Site, the \"Service\") provided by Educreations, Inc.\n(\"Educreations,\" \"We,\" \"Our\" or \"Us\"), including how Educreations treats information (including, personal information) that we collect and receive.\nThe term \u201cPersonal Information\u201d, as used in this Privacy Policy, refers to any information that can be used to identify a specific person, or any anonymous information (e.g.\nIP address) that is linked to a specific person.\nPersonal Information does not include information that has been aggregated or made anonymous such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with a specific person.\nThis policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes.\nThis Privacy Policy is part of and incorporated into Educreations' Terms of Use (\u201cTerms of Use\u201d).</p>\n</li>\n<li>Educreations' Privacy Pledge To You<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy.\nYou may add, delete or modify your Personal Information at any time.\nSubject to your permission or as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, exchange or otherwise share your Personal Information with third parties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Children's Personal Information<p>Educreations collects limited Personal Information from students (\"Children's Personal Information\"), but only where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with Educreations to collect Children's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment.\nChildren under 13 years old are not allowed to create an account without a parent or guardian's permission.\nWe recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>\n<p>We require schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students' parents before collecting any such Children's Personal Information.\nIf you are a student, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Service.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Service, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nIf you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Service, or that a student's school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us.</p>\n<p>Hereinafter, references to \"Personal Information\" shall apply to personal information of individual Site users who are not student registrants.\nReferences to \"Children's Personal Information\" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Site.\nGeneral references to \"information\" shall apply to all users.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Information Collection and How it is Used<p>\n<i>Information that you knowingly and voluntarily provide.</i> We receive and store any

Information such as your name, email address, photograph, and your school affiliation, Children's Personal Information (which shall be limited to your name, photograph, and the contact information necessary to receive notifications via the Service from your teacher, school, and/or district), and any other information necessary for us to provide our services.\nYou may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features.\nThe Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features.\nThe Children's Personal Information you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will identify you within the user group(s) for which you have been granted an access code (\"Limited-access User Group\")), and for sending you notifications.\nYou may modify or remove your Personal Information or Children's Personal Information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features to edit your profile and/or

available and can be collected and used by others, in accordance with the privacy settings you select in your account preferences, or in accordance with the User Category to which you belong.\nFor example, if you are a student, any content you contribute in your Limited-access User Group(s) will only be displayed to other members of that Limited-access User Group.\nhowever, we cannot control what members of your Limited-access User Group will do with such content after you have disclosed it.\nYour display name may be displayed to other users when you upload images or videos or send messages through the Service and other users can contact you through messages and comments.\nAny images, captions or other content that you submit to the Service may be redistributed through the Internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.</p>\n<p>Personal Information and Children's Personal Information collected through the Site may be shared with companies and

or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation.\nIf such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company\u2019s use of your Personal Information and
