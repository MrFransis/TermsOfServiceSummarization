FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.1 Application</strong>.\nYou and Asana agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.\nThis Section 12 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\nclaims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising).\nand claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.\nThe only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.2.\nInitial Dispute Resolution</strong>.\nMost disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration.\nIf you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at dispute-notice@asana.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account).\nExcept for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Asana, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.3 Binding Arbitration</strong>.\nIf the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided in section 12.7 below) subject to the terms set forth below.\nSpecifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms\u2019 formation, performance, and breach), the parties\u2019 relationship with each other, and/or your use of Asana shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures (\u201cJAMS\u201d).\nThe JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.\nAsana will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000.\nIf you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.\nAsana will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.4 Arbitrator\u2019s Powers</strong>.\nThe arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct.\nThe arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.5 Filing a Demand</strong>.\nTo start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration (\u201cDemand\u201d) that (i) briefly explains the dispute, (ii) lists your and Asana\u2019s names and addresses, (iii) specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable, (iv) identify the requested location for a hearing if an in-person hearing is requested, and (v) state what you want in the dispute.\n(b) send one copy of the Demand to JAMS, along with a copy of these Terms and the filing fee required by JAMS.\nand (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at dispute-notice@asana.com.</p>\n<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.\nThey further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nIf you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration.\nFor individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you and Asana agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, United States, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.6 Class Action Waiver</strong>.\nThe parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party\u2019s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis.\nYOU AND ASANA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong>.\nNotwithstanding the parties\u2019 decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (\u201cintellectual property rights\u201d means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).\nEither party may also seek relief in small claims court in San Francisco, California for disputes or claims within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>.\nYou have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to dispute-notice@asana.com with the subject line, \u201cARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.\u201d The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Service or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on the Site.\nOtherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs.\nIf you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Asana also will not be bound by them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.9 Changes to This Section</strong>.\nAsana will provide thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Service and Websites.\nAmendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Service and Websites or sent to you by email.\nChanges to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.\nIf a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on \u201cChanges to This Section\u201d is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Service and Websites.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.10 Survival</strong>.\nThis Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Service and Websites.</p>\n13.\nCONTROLLING LAW AND SEVERABILITY\n<p>These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of California notwithstanding its conflicts of law principles.\nAny dispute arising out of these terms and conditions or the use of this site shall be initiated and conducted in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California, and you and Asana consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.</p>\n14.\nGENERAL TERMS\n<p>\n<strong>14.1 Force Majeure</strong>.\nUnder no circumstances shall Asana or its licensor or supplier be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.2 No Waiver</strong>.\nNo waiver of any provision of these Terms will be binding unless in writing, no waiver of any provisions of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and the failure of Asana to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive that right or remedy.\nIf an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be
