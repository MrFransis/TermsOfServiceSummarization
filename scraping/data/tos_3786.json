about the nature and extent of the processing of so-called personal data by skatedeluxe GmbH.\nPersonal data is information that can be directly or indirectly attributed or assigned to your

to object to selected data processing</strong>.\nin particular, data processing for advertising purposes.\nYou can quickly identify the option to object by the following symbol:</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our privacy policy, feel free to contact our Internal Data Protection Officer at any time.\nYou can find the contact details below.</p>\n2.\nName and Contact Details of the Data

the following websites: www.skatedeluxe.com and www.skatedeluxe.ch.\nThe Internal Data Protection Officer of the skatedeluxe GmbH can be reached at the aforementioned address, c/o Data Protection Officer, or at service.en@skatedeluxe.com.</p>\n3.\nPurposes of Data Processing, Legal Bases and Legitimate Interests Pursued by skatedeluxe GmbH Or a Third Party, as well as Categories of Recipient\n3.1.\nAccessing our Website\n<p>When you visit our website, the browser used on your device automatically sends information to the server of our website and temporarily stores it in a so-called log file.\nWe have no influence over this.\n<strong>The following information</strong> is also recorded without any action on your part and is stored until automated deletion:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the IP address of the requesting Internet-enabled device</li>\n<li>the date and time of access</li>\n<li>the website from which access initiated (HTTP referer)</li>\n<li>the browser you use and, if applicable, the operating system of your Internet-capable device and the name of your access provider</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR provides the legal basis for<strong> processing the IP address</strong>.\nOur legitimate interest derives from the purposes of data collection listed below.\nAt this juncture, we would like to point out that from the data collected, no direct conclusions about your identity can be made nor are they drawn by us.</p>\n<p>The IP address of your device and the other data listed above are used by us for the <strong>following purposes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ensuring a smooth connection setup</li>\n<li>ensuring comfortable use of our website</li>\n<li>evaluating system security and stability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data is stored for a <strong>period</strong> of 30 days and then automatically deleted.\nWe also use cookies, tracking tools, targeting techniques and social media plug-ins for our website.\nThe exact procedures and how your data is used for that will be described and explained in more detail below in section 3.4.</p>\n3.2.\nExecution, Conclusion, or Termination of a Contract\n<p>The scope of activity of skatedeluxe GmbH is the remote selling of goods and services.\nIn this context, we process the data required for the <strong>execution, conclusion, or termination of a contract</strong> with you.\nWhich includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First Name, Last Name</li>\n<li>Billing and Delivery Address</li>\n<li>Email Address</li>\n<li>Billing and payment data</li>\n<li>Date of Birth, if applicable</li>\n<li>Telephone Number, if necessary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR, i.e.\nYou provide us with the data based on the contractual relationship between us.\nTo process your email address, we are also obligated to send an electronic order confirmation due to a requirement in the Civil Code (BGB) (see Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR).\nInsofar as we do not use your contact data for advertising purposes (see point 3.3.), we store the data collected for the execution of the contract until the expiration of the statutory or, if applicable, contractual warranty and guarantee rights.\nAfter expiration of this period, we retain information of our contractual relationship as required by commercial and tax law for the statutory periods.\nFor this period (usually ten years from the conclusion of the contract), the data will be reprocessed in the event of a review by the tax authorities.<br> In order to process the purchase agreement, the following data processing is necessary:</p>\n<p>If you have selected a payment method other than Pay-In-Advance or Cash on Delivery, we pass on the required payment data to a payment service provider whom we commission.\nWe will forward details of your delivery address to a logistics company commissioned by us for the purpose of completing the purchase agreement.</p>\n3.3.\nData Processing for Advertising Purposes\n<p>The following statements pertain to the processing of personal data for advertising purposes.\nThe GDPR declares such data processing on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) as fundamentally conceivable and as a legitimate interest.\nThe duration of data storage for advertising purposes is not subject to any rigid principles and is based on the question of whether the storage is required for the promotional approach.\nIn 3.3.4., you can read about the procedure in the case of your opposition.</p>\n3.3.1.\nAdvertising Purposes of skatedeluxe GmbH\n<p>To the extent that you have consummated a contract with us, we will treat you as an established customer.\nIn this case, we will process your <strong>postal contact details</strong> without explicit consent

without explicit consent.</p>\n3.3.2.\nPersonalised Ads &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<p>In order for you to only receive promotional information that is of perceived interest to you, we categorise and <strong>supplement your customer profile with additional information</strong>.\nThis requires the use of both statistical information and information about you (e.g., basic customer profile data).\nThe goal is to provide you with advertisements solely oriented to your actual or perceived needs and not to bother you with useless advertising.</p>\n3.3.3.\nNewsletter\n<p>On our website we offer you the opportunity to register for our newsletter.</p>\n<p>Your <strong>e-mail address</strong> is sufficient for registration.\nAs an

confirmation e-mail with your personal voucher.</p>\n<p>Newsletter registration is <strong>documented</strong> in order to prove that the registration process was completed in accordance with legal requirements.\nThis includes saving the date of registration and confirmation as well as the IP address.\nIn addition, changes to your data which are saved at our&nbsp;email marketing provider&nbsp;(see below) will be documented as well.\nDocumenting the registration process is based on our legitimate interests as per article 6 (1) f GDPR.\nOur interest is to establish a user

/ Universal Analytics\n<p>For the purpose of the needs-oriented design and continuous optimisation of our site, we use Google Analytics on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.\nIt is a web analysis service provided by Google Ireland Limited (\"Google\"), a company registered and operated under Irish law (register number: 368047), located in Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.\nIn this context, <strong>pseudonymised usage profiles</strong> are created and cookies are used.\nThe information generated by the cookie about your usage of this website such as</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Browser Type / Version,</li>\n<li>Operating System being used,</li>\n<li>Referrer-URL (the page you were previously on),</li>\n<li>Host name of the connected device (IP-Address),</li>\n<li>Time of the server request</li>\n</ul>\n<p>are transmitted to Google servers.\nGoogle operates servers around the world therefore your data may also be processed on servers outside of the EU, for example on Google LLC servers in the USA.&nbsp;In compliance with the EU Privacy Policy, Google has been certified in accordance with the <strong>Privacy Shield Agreement</strong> between the EU and USA and Switzerland and the USA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The information is used to evaluate the usage of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services related to website and internet usage for the purposes of market research and tailor-made website design.\nThis information may also be transferred to third parties if required by law or if those third parties are processing the data on Google\u2019s behalf.\nYour IP address will never be merged with other data from Google.\nThe IP addresses are rendered anonymous, so that <strong>identification and assignment is not possible</strong> (so-called IP masking).</p>\n<p>We use Google Analytics including the features of <strong>Universal Analytics</strong>.\nUniversal Analytics allows us to analyse the activities on our pages across devices (so-called cross-device tracking, for example, when you access via laptop and later via a tablet).\nThis is made possible by assigning a <strong>pseudonymous user ID</strong> to a user.\nThis kind of allocation occurs, for example, when you register for a customer account or when you sign into your customer account.\nHowever, <strong>no personal information is forwarded to Google</strong>.\nAdding additional features to Google Analytics with Universal Analytics does not entail any limitation or reduction of data protection measures such as IP masking or the browser add-on.</p>\n<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on the browser software.\nWe\u2019d like to point out, however, that if you elect this option, not all of the features of this website may be fully available to you.</p>\n<p>You may also <strong>prevent</strong> the collection of data generated by the cookie and relevant to your use of the website (including your IP address) and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing this browser add-on.</p>\n<p>As an alternative to the browser add-on, especially for browsers on mobile devices, you can prevent Google Analytics from capturing cookies by setting the switch to \"ACTIVE\".</p> Active Inactive <p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An opt-out cookie will be set which prevents the future collection of your data when you visit our website.\nThe opt-out Cookie is only valid in this browser and only for our website and is stored on your device.\nIf you delete the cookies in this browser, you\u2019ll have to reset the opt-out Cookie.</p>\n<p>For more information about privacy in connection with Google Analytics, please visit the Google Analytics website.</p>\n3.4.4.\nTargeting\n<p>The targeting measures we employ listed below are implemented pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.\nBy employing these targeting measures, we strive to make sure that only <strong>advertising oriented to your actual or perceived interests is displayed on your devices</strong>, because we do not want to bother you with uninteresting ads.</p>\n<p>3.4.4.1.\nOnsite-Targeting</p>\n<p>On our website, cookies are used to collect and evaluate information for ad optimisation.\nThis data may contain, for example, information about which of our products you are interested in.\nThe collection and evaluation are done <strong>exclusively pseudonymously</strong> and does not allow us to identify you.\nMore particularly, the information is not merged with personal information.\nUsing information about your past user behaviour, we can show you offers on our site that are specifically geared towards your interests.\nThe Onsite Targeting Cookies are automatically <strong>deleted</strong> after 30 days.</p>\n<p>3.4.4.2.\nRe-Targeting</p>\n<p>We also use re-targeting technologies from Criteo GmbH and Google LLC.\n(Google AdSense).\nThis allows us to make our online products and services more interesting for you.\nTo that end, a Cookie is set, with which data about your interests is collected using pseudonyms.\nBased on this information, you will be shown advertisements of our offers on the websites of our partners, specifically based on your interests.\n<strong>No sensitive personal information</strong> will be stored, and <strong>no user profiles</strong> will be merged with personally identifiable information about you.\nThe re-targeting cookies are stored for a period of 30 days and then automatically <strong>deleted</strong>.</p>\n<p>3.4.4.3.\nFacebook Pixel</p>\n<p>On our website, we employ Facebook Pixel in the <strong>non-expanded form</strong>.\nThis is a JavaScript, i.e.\na program code that your browser can interpret to help us understand what we do on our site, and to show you interest-driven product information.\n<strong>Details about how it works</strong> are available on the Facebook website.</p>\n<p>The pixel acts as a so-called pseudonym, which means the use of a pixel does not result in any direct association with your person.\nYou have the opportunity to object to this by setting the switch to \"ACTIVE\".</p> Active Inactive <p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An Opt-Out Cookie is set to ensure that no Facebook pixel is set when this website is accessed.\nIf you use multiple browsers, you\u2019ll have to install an Opt-Out Cookie <strong>for each browser</strong> individually.</p>\n<p>3.4.4.4.\nObjection / Opt-Out Opportunity</p>\n<p>In addition to the deactivation methods described above, you can generally prevent the aforementioned targeting technologies by setting a corresponding cookie in your browser (see point 3.4.1).\nIn addition, you have the option to deactivate preference-based advertising with the help of the Preference Manager available here.</p> 3.4.5.\nSocial-Media-Plug-ins\n<p>As permitted by Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR, we use social media Plug-ins on our website from the social networks Facebook and Twitter to raise brand awareness.\nThis underlying commercial purpose is regarded as a legitimate interest in accordance with the GDPR.\nOur compliance with data protection guidelines ensures liability by their respective providers.\nWe integrate these plug-ins by means of the so-called two-click method to best protect visitors of our website.</p>\n<p>3.4.5.1.\nFacebook</p>\n<p>Our website uses plug-ins from the social network Facebook, which is provided by Facebook Inc.\nThe Facebook plug-ins are <strong>denoted</strong> by the Facebook logo with the addition of \"like\" or \"share\".</p>\n<p>If you <strong>activate</strong> such a plug-in (first click), your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers.\nThe content of the plug-in is transmitted by Facebook directly to your browser and is integrated into the page.\nThrough this integration, Facebook receives the information that your browser has accessed that corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a Facebook profile or are currently not logged in to Facebook.</p>\n<p>This information (including your IP address) will be sent from your browser directly to a Facebook server in the U.S.\nand stored there.\nIf you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can immediately assign your visit to our website to your Facebook profile.<br> If you <strong>interact</strong> with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the \"Like\" button (second click), this information will also be sent directly to a Facebook server and stored there.\nThe information will also be posted on your Facebook profile and displayed to your Facebook friends.</p>\n<p>For the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of that data by Facebook, as well as your rights related thereto and settings options to protect your privacy, you can refer to Facebook\u2019s privacy policy.<br> If you do not want Facebook to directly associate the information gathered from your visit to our website with your Facebook profile, you must <strong>log out of Facebook </strong>before visiting our website.</p>\n<p>3.4.5.2.\nTwitter</p>\n<p>Our website also includes the plug-in for the short message network Twitter Inc.\nThe Twitter plug-in (\"tweet\" button) is <strong>denoted</strong> by the Twitter logo (a white bird on a blue background) and the word \"tweet\".\nWhen you visit a page on our website that contains such a plug-in, a direct connection is established between your browser and the Twitter server.\nTwitter receives the information that you, with your IP Address, have visited our site.\nIf you click the Twitter button while logged in to your Twitter account, you can link the contents of our pages to your Twitter profile.\nThis allows Twitter to associate your visit to our pages with your account.\nWe would like to point out that we, as the provider of the website pages, are not aware of the content of the transmitted data and their use by Twitter.\nMore information can be found here.\nIf you do not want Twitter to associate your visit to our pages, please log out of your Twitter account.</p>\n3.5.\nCustomer Account\n<p>In order to provide you with the greatest possible ease while shopping, we offer you the option to permanently store your personal data in a password-protected customer account.\nThe creation of a customer

also <strong>view and change the data</strong> stored in your customer account <strong>at any time</strong>.</p>\n<p>In addition to the data requested from you while placing an order, you must provide a self-chosen password in order to set up a customer account.\nThis, together with your email address, will be used to access your customer account.\nPlease treat your personal access data confidentially and, in particular, do not make it accessible to unauthorized third parties.\nWe cannot accept liability for misused passwords provided we are not responsible for the misuse.\nPlease note that after leaving our website, you will remain logged in unless you actively log out.\nYou have the option to delete your customer account at any time.\nPlease note, however, that this does not mean that the data in the customer account shall be deleted, as we are bound by <strong>statutory retention periods</strong>.</p>\n3.6.\nSocial Login via Facebook, Twitter or Google\n<p>In case you are registered at Facebook, Google or Twitter, you can login at skatedeluxe with your login data.\nThis simplifies the registration process and you don\u2019t have to remember any additional login

corresponding application documents to us via email or cloud link.\nShould skatedeluxe enter into a contract of employment with an applicant, the transmitted data will be stored for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship in compliance with legal requirements.\nIf we do not enter into a contract of employment with the applicant, the application documents will be automatically deleted two months after the notification of declination, provided that deletion does not conflict with any other legitimate interests of the person responsible for the processing.\nIn that sense, an example of legitimate interest would be to meet the burden of proof in proceedings pursuant to the General Act on Equal Treatment (Allgemeinen Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG)).</p>\n<p>Should we foresee the possibility to hire an applicant at a later date, we will ask for the applicant\u2019s <strong>permission</strong> to save the application documents for future contact, beyond the aforementioned <strong>retention period</strong>.\nOf course, the applicant can revoke consent to our retaining of the application documents at any time by sending an email to jobs@skatedeluxe.com or using the

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).</p>\n5.\nYour Rights \u2028\n5.1.\nOverview\n<p>In addition to the right to revoke the consent you granted to us, you are entitled to the following additional rights, subject to applicable law:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have the <strong>right to information</strong> about your personal data stored by us in accordance with Art.\n15 GDPR.\nIn particular, you are

correct, yet incomplete, data in accordance with Art.\n16 GDPR.</li>\n<li>You have the <strong>right to erase</strong> your personal data stored by us in accordance with.\nArt.\n17 GDPR, except insofar as required by statutory and/or contractual retention periods.\nOther statutory obligations and/or rights for further storage are also to be observed.</li>\n<li>You have the <strong>right to restrict</strong> the processing of your data in accordance with Art.\n18 GDPR, provided that (1) the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data, and instead request the restriction of their use, (2) the person responsible for the data no longer needs it, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or (3) you have objected to processing in accordance with Art.\n21 GDPR.</li>\n<li>You have the <strong>right to data portability</strong> in accordance with Art.\n20 GDPR, i.e.\nYou have the right to receive selected data concerning

particular situation.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The aforementioned <strong>general right to object</strong> applies to all processing purposes described in this Privacy Policy, which are handled on the basis of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR.\nUnlike the special right to object to data processing for commercial purposes (see point 3.3.4.), according to the GDPR, we are only obligated to execute such a general objection if you can provide us with reasons of overriding importance (e.g.\npossible threat to life or health).\nFurthermore, it is possible to contact the supervisory authority responsible for skatedeluxe GmbH or our data protection officer (see Section 2).</p>\n6.\nData Security Measures\n<p>All of the personal data that you share with us, including your payment details, is transmitted via the general, commonly used and <strong>secure standard SSL</strong> (Secure Socket Layer).\nSSL is a secure and proven Standard, which is also used in online banking, for example.\nYou can recognise a

which, depending on the browser, used is also typically located near the address bar.</p>\n<p>Of course, we take the appropriate <strong>technical and organisational security measures</strong> to <strong>protect</strong> your personal data against manipulation, partial or complete loss, and against unauthorized access by third parties.\nOur security measures are <strong>continuously improved</strong> in line with technological developments.</p>\n<p>Last Updated: 29.03.2019</p> Shipping Returns &amp.\nCancellation Exchange Size conversion chart FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
