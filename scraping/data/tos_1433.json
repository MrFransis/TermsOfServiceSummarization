enable features on the Website.\nA cookie is a small text file that stores Internet settings.\nThe next time you visit this Website with the same terminal device, the cookie and the information in it are either sent back to the originating website (first-party cookie) or to another website to which it belongs (third-party cookie).\nBy that, the Website can detect that it has already been opened using this browser, and in some cases, it will then vary the content it shows.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2</strong> Almost every website uses cookie technology.\nSome cookies are useful as they are able to improve the user experience.\nCookies, among other things, speed navigation through our Website, keep track of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Website, help

exempt.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookies exempt from consent</strong>: Strictly necessary cookies guarantee functions without which you would not be able to use the Website as intended.\nThey are

use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc.\n(\"Google\").\nGoogle Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Website analyze how
