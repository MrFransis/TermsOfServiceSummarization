without your agreement for other purposes-).\nWithout activity on your part, we will delete your identifying data after 5 years.</p>\n<p>Within the framework of our missions, among which the contribution to the experimentation and the study of the teaching practices, we can also give access to researchers to certain data of use of the platform: in this case, these are entirely pseudonymised.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Privacy Icons, de l'association PrivacyTech (CC BY-ND : https://www.privacytech.fr/privacy-icons/)</em>\n</p> In detail: <p>By accessing or

as it contributes to determining the purposes and means of the treatment.\nAn arrangement was concluded between FUN and this organization, which specifies the responsibilities of each (FUN being responsible for the operation of the platform and the choice of service providers, the organization of the use of the services);</li>\n<li>the personal data collected is as follows:
