General Philosophy <p>Quality Logo Products<sup>\u00ae</sup> takes privacy seriously and does everything it can to safeguard it.\nThis Privacy Notice (\"Notice\") will tell you what personal information (\"PI\") we collect from you, how we use it, when we use your information to contact you, under which circumstances we may disclose it to any third party, and your choices regarding any of your personal information that is disclosed to us.</p>\n<p>Because no online system can ever be guaranteed to be 100% secure, 100% of the time, we ask that if you have any concerns or complaints that your PI held by Quality Logo Products<sup>\u00ae</sup> could have been compromised, or someone could have discovered your personal details held by us, please contact us immediately.\nOur contact

of developments as we provide our goods/services to you.</p> 4.\nHow Long Will Quality Logo Products<sup>\u00ae</sup> Keep My Information? <p>We will hold your PI on our systems for as long as it takes to fulfill your order or otherwise fulfill any request made by you, and to comply with legal requirements.\nLegally, we need to hold a limited amount of your PI for a period of 7 years.</p> 5.\nCan I Delete My Data? <p>You can always ask for your information to be deleted.\nHowever, please understand that if it is less than 7 years old, we may be legally required to keep it (see Section 4 above).</p>\n<p>Deleting the data Quality Logo Products<sup>\u00ae</sup> holds about you will erase any PI we have about you.\nAny data we have pertaining to you after we delete your PI will be made

will not discriminate against you by offering you different pricing or products, or by providing you with a different level or quality of services, based solely upon your request.\nHowever, in some circumstances, for example where you have requested or consented to our services that use your PI to provide the service, we may not be able to provide a service if you choose to delete your PI.</p> 7.\nCan I Find Out What Information Quality Logo Products<sup>\u00ae</sup> Holds About Me? <p>You have the right to request a copy of the PI that Quality Logo Products<sup>\u00ae</sup> holds about you, and if any information is wrong, we will correct it for you.\nWe require you to confirm your identity with 2 pieces of approved identification such as a passport, drivers' license, birth
