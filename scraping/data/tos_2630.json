days\u2019 notice.\nIf they do change, your continued use of the Services, as the case may be, after the change indicates your agreement with the new fees and charges after the effective date of the

any applicable jurisdiction.</p> 4.\nOwnership, Copyright and Trademarks <p>In these Terms the content available through the Services, including all information, data, logos, marks, designs, graphics, pictures, sound files, other files, and their selection and arrangement, is called \u201cContent\u201d.\nContent provided by Users, whether they are Subscribers, Customers or other Users, is called \u201cUser Content\u201d.\nFor example, images that you upload to the Application (for media monitoring purposes) is your User Content.</p>\n<p>User Content is the User\u2019s property.\nTinEye's only right to that User Content is the limited licenses to it granted in these Terms.\nThose licenses are described in Section 5 and Section 15 of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Other than the User Content, the Services, all Content and all software available on the Services or used to create and operate the Services is the property of TinEye or its licensors, and is protected by Canadian and international

permitted to provide to them the User Content, and also agree that we have no responsibility or liability for their use of such User Content.</p> 5.\nYour Limited License of Your User Content to TinEye <p>We do not claim any ownership interest in your User Content, but we do need the right to use your User Content to the extent necessary to operate the Site and provide the Services, now and in the future.</p>\n<p>Therefore, by posting or distributing User Content to or through the Services, you (a) grant TinEye and its affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free,

otherwise have the lawful right to post and distribute that User Content, to or through the Services.\nand (ii) the use and posting or other transmission of such User Content does not violate these Terms and will not violate any rights of or cause injury to any person or entity.</p>\n<p>If your User Content is intended for the use of other Users, you also grant us and our affiliates and subsidiaries a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable right to sublicense such User Content to such Users for their use in connection with their use of the Services, as described in Section 6 of these Terms.</p>\n<p>These licenses from you are non-exclusive because you have the right to use your User Content elsewhere.\nThey are royalty-free because we are not required to pay you for the use of your User Content on the Services.\nAnd they are transferable because we need the right to transfer these licenses to any successor operator of the Services.\nOur rights to \u201cmodify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from\u201d are necessary because the normal operation of the Services does this to your User Content when it processes it for use in the Services.</p> 6.\nOur

available to you through the Services, and to use the reports provided to you by the Services for any purpose relating to your User Content.\nSuch license is subject to these Terms, and specifically conditioned upon the following: (i) you may only view, copy and print such portions of the Content for your own use.\n(ii) you may not modify or otherwise make derivative works of the Content, or reproduce, distribute or display the Content (except for page cacheing) except as expressly permitted in these Terms.\n(iii) you may not remove or modify any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices that have been placed in the Content.\n(iv) you may not use any data mining, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods.\nand (v) you may not use the Services or the Content other

result of using the Services any of the following:</p>\n<p>Automated cease and desist letters or demands, or demands for payment or of any other kind, concerning alleged infringement by another person

terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Materials and Third-Party Services, and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.</p> 10.\nWarranty Disclaimer <p>The Site, the Content and the Services are provided to you on an \u201cas is\u201d basis without warranties
