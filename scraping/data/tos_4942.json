8873, "name": "Privacy Policy", "url": "https://canarymail.io/privacy.html", "xpath": "/html/body/section[1]/div", "text": "\nPrivacy Overview\nIntroduction\n<p>Canary takes your privacy seriously.\nThe regulatory landscape governing privacy is undergoing significant change worldwide, and governments and consumers alike are demanding increased transparency and individual control.\nThe EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the latest and most profound example of this trend.\nCanary welcomes the arrival of the GDPR.\nThe success of our company depends on maintaining the trust of our users and other stakeholders in our ability to deliver a secure and quality product.\nA summary of our GDPR-compliant policies for the benefit of our customers can be found below.\nYou may find a full version of our policy here.</p>\nPersonal Data We Collect\n<p>The information Canary accesses and collects depends on the way you use it.\nBy default, Canary does not collect or store the content of your personal email messages, whether incoming or outgoing.</p>\n<p>In order to function properly, Canary Mail for Mac, iOS, and Android accesses your name, email address, credentials (such as OAuth access tokens for email servers which support them), and email content.\nThis information is stored on your device and is never shared with 3rd parties.\nWe may store your email address in order to contact you regarding important security and / or product updates.</p>\n<p>The only scenario in which we will temporarily store this data is if users of Canary Mail for iOS or Android choose to enable Push notifications when they receive email.\nIn that case, Canary will temporarily store your email address, credentials, sender, subject line, and first line of the message on our server.\nData associated with a specific email is deleted as soon as the notification for that email is delivered to your device.\nAll data is cleared from our server when notifications are disabled on Canary Mail for iOS or Android or when you switch from Push to Fetch mode, in which case all data is stored locally only and new emails are fetched directly from your device.</p>\nHow We Use Personal Data\n<p>The information we collect is used only to operate and maintain Canary Mail.\nWe do not use cookies or similar technology to show you interest-based advertising, nor do we extract data from the content of your emails for tracking or advertising purposes.</p>\n<p>We do use certain data we collect from you for internal purposes such as analyzing how Canary is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, and maintaining security.\nThis includes information such as the marketing channel from which you learned about and downloaded Canary Mail, how often you use it, aggregated usage data, and other performance data.</p>\n<p>Canary\u2019s use of information received from Gmail APIs adheres to Google's Limited Use Requirements.</p>\nReasons We Share Personal Data\n<p>As is true of most websites and apps, Canary uses the services of third parties to support its operation and maintenance.\nThese include parties which provide services for usage analytics, hosting and backend infrastructure, infrastructure monitoring, and customer support.\nSome of these third parties gather only anonymized and aggregated data and are not granted access to personal data such as names, email addresses, and IP addresses.\nUsers who do not wish to make their data available to third-party vendors can disable analytics in the in-app settings or choose not to use their features.\nWe do not have special relationships with any of these service providers.\nCanary has also entered into Data Processor Agreements with its third-party service providers as necessary in order to ensure that they are under the same GDPR privacy obligations as Canary.</p>\nAccess and Control of Your Personal Data\n<p>Canary provides its users with as much control over their data as possible.\nUsers can connect Canary with a number of third-party services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox for uploading large files, Unsplash for a selection of background images, and Intercom for customer support.\nThese are optional services which we have provided for our users\u2019 convenience.\nUsers can also choose to sync preferences, accounts, signatures, etc.\nacross devices via their personal iCloud account.\nThey can opt-in for this functionality and later opt-out and delete all data stored on iCloud at any time.\nCanary iOS or Android users can instantly delete information stored to deliver Push notifications by disabling notifications or switching to Fetch.</p>\nKnow Your Rights\n<p>Under the GDPR, if you are an EU citizen you have the right:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to access your personal data</li>\n<li>to be provided with information about how your personal data is processed</li>\n<li>to have your personal data corrected</li>\n<li>to have your personal data erased in certain circumstances</li>\n<li>to object to or restrict how your personal data is processed</li>\n<li>to take any complaints about how we process your data to the Data</li> Protection Authority in your country.\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\nContact Us\n<p>Your information&nbsp;is controlled by Mailr Tech LLP.\nYou may direct any questions regarding this policy to: info
