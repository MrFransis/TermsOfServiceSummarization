entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>\n<p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth this section by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out here.\nThe notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Site, otherwise you shall be bound to
