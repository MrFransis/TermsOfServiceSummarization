privacy obligations <p>Escrow.com takes privacy seriously and cares about personal information.</p>\n<p>'Personal information' means information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.\nEscrow.com's Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected and/or held by Escrow.com.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy also explains how we process 'personal data' about people in the European Union (EU), as required under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n<p>We will review this policy regularly, and we may update it from time to time.</p> The types of personal information we collect and hold <p>We collect personal information about our users in order provide our products, services, and customer support.\nOur products, services, and customer support are provided through many platforms including but not limited to: websites, phone apps, email, and telephone.\nThe specific platform and product, service, or support you interact with may affect the personal data we collect.</p>\n<p>Not all information requested, collected, and processed by us is \u201cPersonal Information\u201d as it does not identify you as a specific natural person.\nThis will include majority of \u201cUser Generated Content\u201d that you provide us with the intention of sharing with other users inside a transaction.\nSuch \u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d is not covered by this privacy policy.\nHowever, as non-personal information may be used in aggregate or be linked with existing personal information.\nwhen in this form it will be treated as personal information.\nAs such, this privacy policy will list both types of information for the sake of transparency.</p>\n<p>In some situation users may provide us with personal information without us asking for it, or through means not intended for the collection of particular types of information.\nWhilst we may take reasonable steps to protect this data, the user will have bypassed our systems, processes, and control and thus the information provided will not be governed by this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>In some situations users may provide us personal information over platforms that are outside our control.\nfor example through social media or forums.\nWhilst any information collected by us is governed by this Privacy Policy, the platform by which it was communicated will be governed by its own Privacy Policy.</p> How we collect personal information Information that you specifically give us <p>While you use our products and services you may be
