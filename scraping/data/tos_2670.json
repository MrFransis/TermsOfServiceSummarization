nor make any promises about the number, identity or reliability of the users that use the LYKA Service nor the content that they share.\nPlease use common sense when using the LYKA app or the GEMs the same way and caution that you would when buying goods and services or making gifts or donations in the physical world.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You should treat your GEMs as you would cash.\nIf unauthorised or incorrect transactions are made through your Wallet you must report this to us immediately and in any event no later than 30 days after the transaction date.\nUpon notification, we

operation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to fund a Wallet with GEMs, payments for the issuance of GEMs by Blue Cat must be made through any permitted payment method available from time to time under \u201cBUY GEMS\u201d in the account owned by the relevant registered LYKA user.\nPayments to, and surrenders from Wallet will be handled by Blue Cat and any of its third party payment processors, such as PayPal.\nLYKA will at no time hold or handle your debit or credit card or bank account information.\nAll legal compliance matters relating to anti-money laundering and/or data privacy, including implementation of Know-Yoour-Client protocols are governed by the terms and conditions of Blue Cat\u2019s chosen payment processing provider at any given time.\nAS such, any concern relating to the same must be coursed through the chosen payment processing provider directly and not with LYKA.\nLYKA will reflect the GEMs in your Wallet once Blue Cat confirms with LYKA the receipt of payment in cleared funds, or when another user sends you GEMs in accordance with this Agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No LYKA app user may be the user of more than one Wallet registered through the LYKA App.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payments received by Blue Cat for GEMs bought by a user is not considered income of Blue Cat, instead it is a fund kept in trust by Blue Cat until the GEMs are used by the

to pay for goods or services.\nPlease note that no interest will be paid on any balance in your Wallet.\nIn using the LYKA app, you warrant and accept responsibility in paying any and all taxes that arise from your personal transactions through any LYKA Service.\nBlue Cat, from time to time, may issue you more GEMs (than the value paid for in GEMs) as a marketing strategy or promotion to convince you and other users to use the GEMs.\nThese marketing GEMs do not earn interest, neither are they interest earned from existing GEMs in you\u2019re Wallet, nor are they a gift or donation by Blue Cat to you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to surrender GEMs for conversion to fiat currency, we or any LYKA Merchant may require you to provide at least one (1) valid government-issued photo ID (such as a passport or driver\u2019s licence), in case of doubt as to the legality of your transactions or the identity of the true owner of the GEMs, which ID may likewise be shared with Blue Cat.\nPlease note that the surrender options of GEMs, from your Wallet may vary depending upon your country of residence and may also vary from time to time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blue Cat will try to process all conversions of GEMs to fiat currency upon surrender as soon as possible, but neither Blue Cat nor LYKA can or shall be responsible for payment processing, banking clearance or other matters that may delay conversions.\nPlease ensure you provide your account details accurately to us and Blue Cat and/or its third party payment processors.\nYou are solely responsible for any errors in information we

to facilitate transactions between you and LYKA Merchants, Blue Cat will deduct and retain (either for itself or to share with its contractors and partners) a service fee of an amount equal to 5% from all payments to a LYKA Merchant made by users using GEMs, to be shouldered by the LYKA Merchant.\nBlue Cat may change the amount it charges from time to time by notifying you or the LYKA Merchant through the LYKA Service in accordance with Clause 12.3.\nPlease note that Blue Cat may charge further and additional fees for certain Wallet- related activities.\nYou should confirm with Blue Cat the details of any such fee prior to you incurring it but in no circumstances will LYKA be responsible to you for any such fee or cost.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> 9.\nTermination &amp.\nSuspension

provide information and documentation sufficient for LYKA and/or Blue Cat to comply with its respective legal obligations relating to anti-money laundering, then LYKA would be entitled to deny you access to all financial and transactional elements of the LYKA Service but may (in LYKA' discretion) still allow you to use the instant messaging elements of the LYKA Service.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>

us.\nWe also reserve the right to pass a complaint to Blue Cat if we deem it appropriate to do so.</p> 12.\nGeneral Terms <ol>\n<li>\n<p>LYKA reserves the right to discontinue all or any aspect of the LYKA Service at any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You may only use the LYKA Service in accordance with these Terms &amp.\nConditions and the rest of the Agreement (as may be amended from time to time).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, any notices that you are required to give us under this Agreement should be sent to our email address published from time to time on the LYKA app or LYKA website (support@mylyka.com).\nWe will send any notices that we are required to give you under this Agreement by sending an email to the email address you gave us when you registered or have subsequently updated and/or by notifying you of a change when you next start the LYKA app and/or by uploading notices on to the LYKA website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Agreement to another organisation, and we will always notify you in writing if this happens, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Agreement.\nWe will wherever possible provide you with prior notice.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This contract is between you and LYKA.\nNo other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms.\nHowever, please note that the Wallet functionality is provided by Blue Cat and is subject to Blue Cat T&amp;C, thus, is a contract between you and Blue Cat, or you and the chosen payment processing provider, whichever is applicable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The unenforceability or invalidity of any clause in this Agreement shall not have an impact on the enforceability or validity of any other clause.\nAny unenforceable or invalid clause shall be regarded as removed to the extent of its unenforceability and invalidity.\nTherefore, this Agreement shall be interpreted and enforced as if it did not contain the said clause only to the extent necessary to make this Agreement enforceable and valid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Agreement or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have given up or waived our rights against you and it will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.\nIf we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties involved to this Agreement, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous negotiations and understandings between the parties, whether oral or written, expressed or implied.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We cannot be responsible for any failure or delay in providing the LYKA Service because of factors which could be reasonably considered outside our control such as public communications network performance, congestion and connectivity, the performance of your handset or other equipment and unpredictable events such as adverse weather conditions or technical failures (including where such technical failures are as a result of the activity of hackers) which might disrupt our business despite our reasonable preventative measures and steps to overcome them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will try and solve any disagreements quickly and efficiently.\nIf you are not happy with the way we deal with any disagreement you and we may agree to refer the matter to arbitration but you and we are not restricted from bringing court proceedings in HK-SAR, where the terms herein shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, HK-SAR law.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> ", "created_at": "2021-01-29 19:57:26.706096", "updated_at": "2021-01-29 19:57:29.709884"}], "points": [{"id": 15225, "title": "You agree to defend,
