Cookie Policy What is a cookie?\n<p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers downloaded on to your computer when you access certain websites.\nLike virtual door keys, cookies unlock a computer\u2019s memory and allow a website to recognize users when they return to a site by opening doors to different content or services.\nLike a key, a cookie itself does not contain information, but when it is read by a browser it can help a website improve the service delivered.</p>\n<p>Cookie files are automatically lodged into the cookie file \u2013 the memory of your browser \u2013 and each one typically contains:<br>\n\u2022\tThe name of the server the cookie was sent from<br>\n\u2022\tThe lifetime of the cookie<br>\n\u2022\tA value \u2013 usually a randomly generated unique number</p>\n<p>The website server which sent the cookie uses this number to recognize you when you return to a site or browse from page to page.\nOnly the server that sent a cookie can read, and therefore use, that cookie.</p>\n<p>We use cookies to help you navigate our website efficiently and to perform certain functions, including website traffic analysis.\nCookies may also recognize you on your next login and offer you content tailored to your preferences and interests.</p>\n<p>Some cookies can collect personal information, including information you disclose like your username, or where

content to your device,</li>\n<li>to track your navigation in order to identify your preferences in terms of our content,</li>\n<li>to offer you customized content based on your preferences identified via your navigation data, and</li>\n<li>to recognize your device, so that you do not have to re-enter the same information each time you access our site.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nThird parties: service providers, partners, social media</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third parties are likely to place cookies on your device.</p>\n<p>We do

content or visited the advertiser\u2019s website after seeing the advertisement on the site.\nand</li>\n<li>to send or display targeted and more relevant marketing and advertising to you on our

several types of cookies including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Session cookies</strong>: Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser\u2019s subfolder while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the website.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Persistent cookies</strong>: In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same website and remain in your browser\u2019s subfolder until they expire (usually after 12 months).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secure cookies</strong>: Secure cookies are a type of cookie which is transmitted over encrypted HTTP connection.\nWhen setting the cookie, the Secure attribute instructs the browser that the cookie should only be returned to the application over encrypted connections.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Third party cookies</strong>: A third party cookie is one that is placed on your hard drive by a website from a domain other than the one you are visiting (e.g.\nwhen the website features content, such as ads, from a third party domain).\nThird party cookies are set so that a site can remember something about you at a later time.\nThese cookies are set by third parties and we do not control how they are set.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The types of cookies that may be used on our site fall into one of four categories as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>\u201cStrictly Necessary\u201d cookies</strong>: These cookies are essential for the operation of our site and enable you to access certain features.\nWithout these cookies, we would be unable to provide you with the online services you request.\nThese cookies do not track where you have been on the internet and do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functional cookies</strong>: Functional cookies are used to recognize you when you return to our site.\nThey also remember your preferences (such as your username, language and region) on our site and enable us to personalize our content for you.\nFunctional cookies do not track your internet usage or gather information which

is only used for statistical purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Targeting cookies</strong>: These cookies may be placed on your device by us or by trusted third parties.\nThey remember that you have visited our site and use that information to provide you with advertising which is tailored to your interests.\nThis is often called online behavioral advertising (OBA) and involves the monitoring of interests based upon web browsing history.\nYour web browsing history can be used to infer things about you (for example, your age, gender etc.), and this information may also be used to make advertising on websites more relevant to you.\nWithout these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can control how cookies are set on your device by adjusting your browser settings (see below).</p>\nHow can you express your choice or object to cookies being placed on your device?\n<p>You may delete or decline
