adopted standard industry practices to protect your personal data and prevent it from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss.\nTo this end, Huawei takes the following

period is required or permitted by law.</p>\n<p>(2) We use a range of technologies such as cryptographic technologies to ensure the confidentiality of data in transmission.\nWe implement trusted protection mechanisms to protect data and data storage servers from attacks.</p>\n<p>(3) We deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access your personal data.\nIn

security measure is perfect and no product, service, website, data transfer, computing system, or network connection is absolutely secure.</p>\n<p>To cope with possible risks, such as personal data leakage, damage, and loss, Huawei has developed several mechanisms and control measures, clearly defined the rating standards of security incidents and vulnerabilities and corresponding processing procedures, and established a dedicated Security Advisory and Security Notice page.\nHuawei has established a dedicated emergency response team to implement security planning, loss reduction, analysis, locating, and remediation, and to perform tracking operations with related departments based on security incident handling regulations and requirements.</p>\n<p>If any personal data incident occurs, Huawei will notify you, pursuant to relevant legal and regulatory requirements, of the basic information about the security incident and its possible impact, measures that Huawei has taken or will take, suggestions about active defense and risk mitigation, and remedial measures.\nThe notification may take the form of an email, text message, push notification, etc.\nIf it is difficult to notify data subjects one by one, we will take appropriate and effective measures to release a Security Notice.\nIn addition, we will also report the handling status of personal data security incidents as required by supervisory authorities.</p> How You Can Manage Your Personal Data <p>A.\nAccess, rectification, deletion, data portability, restriction of processing, objection to

privacy practices for processing personal data protected under various data protection laws.\nHuawei transfers personal data between the countries in which we operate in accordance with the standards and conditions of applicable data protection laws, including standards and conditions related to security and processing.\n</p>\n<p>With respect to personal data coming from the EU or Switzerland, we

the use of cookies.\nDisabling cookies may affect your use of some or all functions of these services.\n</p> Web Beacons and Pixel Tags <p> In addition to cookies, Huawei and some third parties may also use web beacons or pixel tags on websites.\nA web beacon is usually an electronic graphic image embedded into a website or email to identify your device cookies when you browse the website or email.\nPixel tags allow Huawei to send emails in a way that is readable to you and find out whether an email is opened.\n</p>\n<p> Huawei and some third parties use these technologies for various purposes, including analyzing service usage (together with cookies) and providing more satisfactory content and advertisements to you.\nFor example, when you receive an email from Huawei, it may contain a click-through URL which links to a Huawei web page.\nIf you click the link, Huawei will track your visit to help us learn about your preferences for products and services and improve our customer service.\nYou can unsubscribe from the mailing list of Huawei at any time if you do not want to be tracked in this manner.\n</p> Other Local Storage <p> Huawei and some third parties may use other local storage technologies, for example, local shared objects (also called \"Flash cookies\") and HTML5 local storage, in certain products and services.\nSimilar to cookies, these technologies store information on your device and can record some information about your activities and preferences.\nHowever, these technologies may use different media from cookies.\nTherefore, you may not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings.\nFor details about how to disable or delete information contained in Flash cookies, click here.\n</p> Do Not Track <p> Many web browsers provide a Do Not Track function that can release Do Not Track requests to websites.\nCurrently, major Internet standardization organizations have not established policies to specify how websites should handle these requests.\n</p>\n<p> If you enable Do Not Track or other similar functions your browser may provide, Huawei will not change the way we collect and use your data as described in this Statement.\nHowever, we reserve the right to respond to your Do Not Track request and stop the collection of your data without prior notice to you.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Home </li>\n<li> Legal
