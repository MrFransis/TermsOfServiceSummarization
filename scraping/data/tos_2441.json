terms and conditions apply to every offer made by the entrepreneur and to every distance contract concluded between entrepreneur and consumer.<br>\nBefore the distance contract is concluded, the text of these general terms and conditions will be made available to the consumer.\nIf this is not reasonably possible, the entrepreneur will, before the remote agreement is concluded, indicate how the general terms and conditions can be viewed by the entrepreneur and that they will be sent to the consumer free of charge as soon as possible at the consumer's request.<br>\nIf the distance contract is concluded electronically, the text of these general terms and conditions may be made available to the consumer electronically in such a way that the consumer can easily store them on a durable data carrier, contrary to the previous paragraph and before the distance contract is concluded.\nIf this is not reasonably possible, prior to the conclusion of the distance contract, it will be indicated where the general terms and conditions can be viewed electronically and that they will be sent electronically or otherwise free of charge at the consumer's request.<br>\nIn the event that, in addition to these general terms and conditions, specific product or service terms and conditions also apply, the second and third paragraphs shall apply by analogy and the consumer can always invoke the applicable provision that is most favourable to him in the event of conflicting terms and conditions.</p>\n<p>Article 4 - The offer<br>\nIf an offer has a limited period of validity or is made subject to conditions, this will be explicitly stated in the offer.<br>\nThe offer contains a complete and accurate description of the products, digital content and/or services offered.\nThe description is sufficiently detailed to enable the consumer to assess the offer properly.\nIf the entrepreneur uses images, these are a true representation of the offered products, services and/or digital content.\nObvious mistakes or apparent errors in the offer are not binding for the entrepreneur.<br>\nEach offer contains such information that it is clear to the consumer what rights and obligations are attached to the acceptance of the offer.</p>\n<p>Article 5 - The agreement<br>\nThe agreement is concluded, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, at the moment the consumer accepts the offer and meets the conditions set.<br>\nIf the consumer has accepted the offer electronically, the entrepreneur shall immediately confirm receipt of acceptance of the offer electronically.\nAs long as the receipt of this acceptance has not been confirmed by the entrepreneur, the consumer can dissolve the agreement.<br>\nIf the agreement is made electronically, the entrepreneur will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure the electronic transfer of data and will ensure a secure web environment.\nIf the consumer is able to pay electronically, the entrepreneur will take appropriate security measures.<br>\nThe entrepreneur can, within the legal framework, inform himself whether the consumer can meet his payment obligations, as well as all those facts and factors which are important for a responsible conclusion of the distance contract.\nIf, based on this investigation, the entrepreneur has good grounds not to enter into the agreement, he is entitled to refuse an order or request or to attach special conditions to the execution.<br>\nAt the latest upon delivery of the product, service or digital content to the consumer, the entrepreneur will send the following information, in writing or in such a way that the consumer can store it in an accessible manner on a durable data carrier: <br>\nThe visiting address of the establishment of the entrepreneur where the consumer can lodge complaints;<br>\nThe conditions under which and the way in which the consumer can make use of the right of withdrawal, or a clear statement about being excluded from the right of withdrawal;<br>\nThe information about guarantees and existing service after purchase;<br>\nThe price including all taxes of the product, service or digital content.\nwhere applicable, the costs of delivery.\nand the method of payment, delivery or performance of the distance contract;<br>\nThe requirements for terminating the contract if the contract has a duration of more than one year or is of indefinite duration;<br>\nIf the consumer has a right of withdrawal, the withdrawal form.<br>\nIn the case of a long-term transaction, the provision in the previous paragraph shall only apply to the first delivery.</p>\n<p>\nArticle 6 - Right of withdrawal<br>\nFor products:<br>\nThe consumer can dissolve an agreement regarding the purchase of a product during a reflection period of at least 14 days without giving reasons.\nThe entrepreneur may ask the consumer for the reason of withdrawal, but does not oblige the consumer to state his reason(s).<br>\nThe cooling-off period mentioned in paragraph 1 starts on the day after the consumer, or a third party appointed by the consumer in advance, who is not the carrier, has received the product, or:<br>\nif the consumer has ordered several products in the same order: the day on which the consumer, or a third party designated by the consumer in advance, has received the last product.\nThe entrepreneur may, provided he has clearly informed the consumer about this prior to the ordering process, refuse an order for multiple products with a different delivery time.<br>\nIf the delivery of a product consists of several shipments or parts: the day on which the consumer, or a third party appointed by him, has received the last shipment or the last part;<br>\nin the case of contracts for regular delivery of products during a given period: the day on which the consumer, or a third party designated by him, has received the first product.</p>\n<p>In the case of services and digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium:<br>\nThe consumer may terminate a service contract and a contract for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium for a minimum period of 14 days without giving any reason.\nThe entrepreneur may ask the consumer for the reason for withdrawal, but does not oblige the consumer to state his reason(s).<br>\nThe cooling-off period mentioned in paragraph 3 starts on the day following the conclusion of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Extended cooling-off period for products, services and digital content that has not been delivered on a material carrier in case of failure to inform about the right of withdrawal:<br>\nIf the entrepreneur has not provided the consumer with the legally required information about the right of withdrawal or the withdrawal form, the cooling-off period expires twelve months after the end of the original cooling-off period determined in accordance with the previous paragraphs of this article.<br>\nIf the entrepreneur has provided the consumer with the information referred to in the previous paragraph within twelve months after the starting date of the original cooling-off period, the cooling-off period shall end 14 days after the day on which the consumer has received this information.</p>\n<p>Article 7 - Obligations of the consumer during the reflection period<br>\nDuring the reflection period, the consumer will handle the product and its packaging with care.\nHe will only unpack or use the product to the extent necessary to determine the nature, characteristics and functioning of the product.\nThe basic principle here is that the consumer may only handle and inspect the product as he would in a shop.\n<br>\nThe consumer shall only be liable for any diminished value of the product resulting from a handling of the product which goes beyond what is permitted in paragraph 1.<br>\nThe consumer is not liable for any reduction in value of the product if the entrepreneur has not provided him with all legally required information about the right of withdrawal before or at the conclusion of the agreement.</p>\n<p>Article 8 - Exercise of the right of withdrawal by the consumer and costs thereof<br>\nIf the consumer makes use of his right of withdrawal, he shall report this to the entrepreneur within the cooling-off period by means of the withdrawal form or in another unambiguous manner.\n<br>\nAs soon as possible, but within 14 days from the day following the notification referred to in paragraph 1, the consumer shall return the product, or hand it over to (an authorized representative of) the entrepreneur.\nThis is not necessary if the entrepreneur has offered to collect the product himself.\nThe consumer has in any case observed the return period if he returns the product before the reflection period has expired.<br>\nThe consumer returns the product with all delivered accessories, if reasonably possible in original condition and packaging, and in accordance with the reasonable and clear instructions provided by the entrepreneur.<br>\nThe risk and burden of proof for the correct and timely exercise of the right of withdrawal lies with the consumer.<br>\nThe consumer bears the direct costs of returning the product.\nIf the entrepreneur has not reported that the consumer has to bear these costs or if the entrepreneur indicates to bear the costs himself, the consumer does not have to bear the costs of returning the product.<br>\nIf the consumer withdraws after having first explicitly requested that the provision of the service or the supply of gas, water or electricity which are not made ready for sale in a limited volume or certain quantity starts during the reflection period, the consumer owes the entrepreneur an amount which is proportional to that part of the commitment which the entrepreneur has fulfilled at the moment of withdrawal, compared to the full fulfilment of the commitment.\n<br>\nThe consumer shall not bear any costs for the performance of services or the supply of water, gas or electricity, which are not put up for sale in a limited volume or quantity, or for the supply of district heating, if:<br>\nthe entrepreneur has not provided the consumer with the legally required information about the right of withdrawal, the reimbursement of costs in case of withdrawal or the withdrawal form, or.\n<br>\nthe consumer has not expressly requested the start of the performance of the service or the supply of gas, water, electricity or district heating during the cooling-off period.<br>\nThe consumer shall not bear any costs for the supply, in whole or in part, of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium, if:<br>\nhe has not explicitly consented to the commencement of performance of the contract before the end of the cooling-off period prior to its delivery;<br>\nhe has not acknowledged losing his right of withdrawal when giving his consent.\nor<br>\nThe entrepreneur has failed to confirm this statement from the consumer.<br>\nIf the consumer makes use of his right of withdrawal, all additional agreements will be dissolved ipso jure.</p>\n<p>Article 9 - Obligations of the entrepreneur in case of withdrawal<br>\nIf the entrepreneur allows the consumer to revoke electronically, he will send a confirmation of receipt without delay after receipt of this notification.<br>\nThe entrepreneur shall reimburse all payments made by the consumer, including any delivery costs charged by the entrepreneur for the returned product, immediately but within 14 days following the day on which the consumer notifies him of the withdrawal.\nUnless the entrepreneur offers to collect the product himself, he may wait until he has received the product or until the consumer can prove that he has returned the product, whichever time is earlier.\n<br>\nThe entrepreneur uses the same means of payment that the consumer has used for the refund, unless the consumer agrees to a different method.\nThe refund is free of charge for the consumer.<br>\nIf the consumer has chosen a more expensive method of delivery than the cheapest standard delivery, the entrepreneur does not have to reimburse the additional costs for the more expensive method.</p>\n<p>Article 10 - Exclusion of right of withdrawal<br>\nThe entrepreneur can exclude the following products and services from the right of withdrawal, but only if the entrepreneur has clearly stated this in the offer, at least in time for the conclusion of the agreement:<br>\nProducts or services of which the price is linked to fluctuations in the financial market which are beyond the Entrepreneur's control and which may occur within the withdrawal period;<br>\nContracts that have been concluded during a public auction.\nBy a public auction is meant a sales method in which products, digital content and/or services are offered by the entrepreneur to the consumer who is personally present or has the opportunity to be personally present at the auction, under the supervision of an auctioneer, and in which the successful bidder is obliged to purchase the products, digital content and/or services;<br>\nService agreements, after full execution of the service, but only if:<br>\nperformance has started with the express prior consent of the consumer.\nand<br>\nThe consumer has declared that he loses his right of withdrawal as soon as the entrepreneur has fully executed the contract;<br>\nPackage tours as referred to in article 7:500 BW and passenger transport agreements;<br>\nService agreements for the provision of accommodation, if the agreement provides for a certain date or period of performance and other than for residential purposes, transport of goods, car rental services and catering;<br>\nLeisure contracts, if the contract provides for a specific date or period of performance thereof;<br>\nProducts made to the consumer's specifications, which are not prefabricated and which are made on the basis of the consumer's individual choice or decision, or which are clearly intended for a particular person;<br>\nProducts which are liable to deteriorate rapidly or have a limited shelf life;<br>\nSealed products which are not suitable for return for reasons of health protection or hygiene and whose seal has been broken after delivery.\nThis regulation is mandatory under Dutch law by virtue of art.\n6:230p sub f under 1 of the Dutch Civil Code;<br>\nProducts which, by their nature, have been irrevocably mixed with other products after delivery;<br>\nAlcoholic beverages of which the price was agreed upon when the agreement was concluded, but of which the delivery can only take place after 30 days, and of which the actual value depends on fluctuations in the market over which the entrepreneur has no influence;<br>\nSealed audio, video recordings and computer software, of which the seal has been broken after delivery;<br>\nNewspapers, magazines or journals, with the exception of subscriptions to these;<br>\nThe delivery of digital content other than on a material carrier, but only if:<br>\nthe execution has started with the express prior consent of the consumer.\nand<br>\nthe consumer has declared that he thereby loses his right of withdrawal.</p>\n<p>\nArticle 11 - The price<br>\nDuring the period of validity stated in the offer, the prices of the products and/or services offered will not be increased, except for price changes due to changes in VAT rates.<br>\nContrary to the previous paragraph, the entrepreneur may offer products or services whose prices are subject to fluctuations in the financial market and on which the entrepreneur has no influence, with variable prices.\nThis obligation to fluctuate and the fact that any prices quoted are target prices will be stated in the offer.\n<br>\nPrice increases within 3 months after the conclusion of the agreement are only allowed if they are the result of legal regulations or provisions.<br>\nPrice increases from 3 months after the conclusion of the contract are only allowed if the entrepreneur has stipulated this and: <br>\na.\nthey are the result of legal regulations or provisions.\nor<br>\nb.\nthe consumer has the right to terminate the contract from the day on which the price increase takes effect.<br>\nThe prices mentioned in the offer of products or services are inclusive of VAT.</p>\n<p>Article 12 - Fulfilment of the agreement and extra guarantee <br>\nThe entrepreneur guarantees that the products and/or services meet the agreement, the specifications stated in the offer, the reasonable requirements of reliability and/or usability and the legal provisions and/or government regulations existing on the date of the conclusion of the agreement.\nIf agreed, the entrepreneur also guarantees that the product is suitable for other than normal use.<br>\nAn extra guarantee provided by the entrepreneur, his supplier, manufacturer or importer never limits the legal rights and claims that the consumer can assert against the entrepreneur on the basis of the agreement if the entrepreneur has failed to fulfil his part of the agreement.<br>\nBy extra guarantee is meant every commitment of the entrepreneur, his supplier, importer or producer in which he grants the consumer certain rights or claims that go beyond what the consumer is legally obliged to in case he has failed in the fulfilment of his part of the contract.</p>\n<p>Article 13 - Delivery and execution<br>\nThe entrepreneur will take the greatest possible care in receiving and executing orders for products and in assessing requests for the provision of services.<br>\nThe place of delivery shall be the address which the consumer has given to the entrepreneur.<br>\nSubject to what is stated in article 4 of these general terms and conditions, the entrepreneur shall execute accepted orders expeditiously but at the latest within 30 days, unless a different delivery period has been agreed upon.\nIf the delivery is delayed, or if an order cannot be carried out or can only be carried out partially, the consumer shall be informed of this within 30 days after he has placed the order.\nIn that case, the consumer has the right to dissolve the agreement free of charge and is entitled to any compensation.<br>\nAfter dissolution in accordance with the previous paragraph, the entrepreneur will immediately refund the amount paid by the consumer.<br>\nThe risk of damage and/or loss of products rests with the entrepreneur until the moment of delivery to the consumer or a representative appointed in advance and announced to the entrepreneur, unless explicitly agreed otherwise.</p>\n<p>Article 14 - Duration transactions: duration, termination and renewal<br>\nDenunciation:<br>\nThe consumer may terminate an open-ended contract for the regular supply of products (including electricity) or services at any time, subject to the agreed termination rules and a notice of up to one month.<br>\nThe consumer may terminate a fixed-term contract for the regular supply of products (including electricity) or services at any time at the end of the fixed-term, subject to the agreed termination rules and a notice of up to one month.<br>\nThe consumer may terminate the agreements referred to in the previous paragraphs:<br>\nterminate at any time and not be limited to termination at a specific time or in a specific period;<br>\nat least terminate them in the same way as they have been entered into by the consumer;<br>\nalways terminate with the same notice period as the entrepreneur has stipulated for himself.<br>\nExtension:<br>\nA contract that has been entered into for a definite period and that is intended for the regular delivery of products (including electricity) or services, may not be tacitly extended or renewed for a definite period.<br>\nContrary to the previous paragraph, a fixed-term contract that has been concluded for the regular supply of daily, weekly and weekly newspapers and magazines may be tacitly renewed for a fixed period of up to three months, if the consumer can terminate this renewed contract at the end of the renewal with a period of notice that does not exceed one month.<br>\nA fixed-term contract for the regular supply of products or services may only be tacitly renewed for an indefinite period if the consumer may terminate it at any time with a period of notice that does not exceed one month.\nThe period of notice shall not exceed three months if the contract is for the regular supply of daily or weekly newspapers, newspapers, magazines and periodicals, but less than once a month.<br>\nA contract of limited duration for the regular supply of newspapers, news and weekly newspapers and periodicals (trial or introductory subscription) shall not be tacitly continued and shall end automatically at the end of the trial or introductory period.<br>\nDuration:<br>\nIf a contract has a duration of more than one year, after one year the consumer may terminate the contract at any time with a notice of up to one month, unless the reasonableness and fairness opposes termination before the end of the agreed term.</p>\n<p>Article 15 - Payment<br>\nUnless otherwise stipulated in the agreement or additional conditions, the amounts owed by the consumer must be paid within 14 days of the start of the cooling-off period, or, in the absence of a cooling-off period, within 14 days of the conclusion of the agreement.\nIn the case of an agreement to provide a service, this period shall commence on the day after the consumer has received confirmation of the agreement.<br>\nWhen selling products to consumers, general terms and conditions may never oblige the consumer to pay more than 50% in advance.\nIf an advance payment has been stipulated, the consumer may not assert any rights regarding the execution of the order or service(s) in question before the stipulated advance payment has been made.<br>\nThe consumer has the duty to report any inaccuracies in the payment details provided or stated to the entrepreneur without delay.<br>\nIf the consumer does not meet his payment obligation(s) on time, he shall owe the statutory interest on the amount still due after he has been notified of the late payment by the proprietor and the proprietor has granted the consumer a period of 14 days to still meet his payment obligations, after payment has not been made within this 14-day period, and the proprietor shall be entitled to charge the extrajudicial collection costs he has incurred.\nThese collection costs amount to a maximum of: 15% over outstanding amounts up to \u20ac 2,500.\n10% over the next \u20ac 2,500 and 5% over the next \u20ac 5,000 with a minimum of \u20ac 40.\nThe entrepreneur may deviate from the stated amounts and percentages.</p>\n<p>Article 16 - Complaints procedure<br>\nThe entrepreneur has a sufficiently publicized complaints procedure and handles the complaint in accordance with this complaints procedure.<br>\nComplaints about the implementation of the agreement must be submitted to the entrepreneur completely and clearly described within a reasonable time after the consumer has discovered the defects.<br>\nComplaints submitted to the entrepreneur will be answered within a period of 14 days from the date of receipt.\nIf a complaint requires a foreseeable longer processing time, the entrepreneur will answer within the period of 14 days with a message of receipt and an indication when the consumer can expect a more detailed answer.<br>\nThe consumer must give the entrepreneur at least 4 weeks to solve the complaint in mutual consultation.\nAfter this period, a dispute will arise that is subject to dispute resolution.</p>\n<p>Article 17 - Disputes<br>\nAgreements between the entrepreneur and the consumer to which these general terms and conditions apply, are exclusively governed by Dutch law.</p>\n<p>Article 18 - Changing this document<br>\nThe entrepreneur can unilaterally change this document at any time.\n<br>\nThe entrepreneur must inform consumers with whom he has an existing legal relationship or a long-term contract of any change in this document.</p>\n<p>Article 19 - Damages<br>\nThe entrepreneur is not liable for damage that does not result from his intent or recklessness.</p>\n<p>Article 20 - Obligations outside of this document<br>\nThe entrepreneur has no obligations towards the consumer other than those mentioned in this document, the law or the
