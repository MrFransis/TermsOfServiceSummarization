purposes:<br>\n<br>\n<b>Account registration</b> \u2013 To register your user account.\nWhen registering your account, we process basic data such as your device ID and device type information to generate your unique account ID.\nWe also ask you to create a password to keep your account secure.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Service delivery </b> \u2013 To enable you to use our Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution.\nOperating a VPN solution entails that we process your IP address at a minimum in order to effectively reroute traffic through the servers that can deliver optimal performance of the
