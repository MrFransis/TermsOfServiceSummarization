reasoning.</p>2.\nSupport<p>Support for the matrix.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by New Vector Ltd - however, support is often available from the wider Matrix Community in the public Matrix Support rooms (as listed in the +matrix:matrix.org community).</p>\n<p>Queries sent to support@matrix.org will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the paid team.\nPhone support is not provided.</p>\n<p>We love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance.\nThis means that although we\u2019ll try our best, we do

an email at dpo@element.io.<br>\n</p> 1.2 Scope of This Document <p>This document explains how we process personal data, as it relates to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Element chat app users</em>: Element chat app users use Element to connect to any server that implements the Matrix Protocol.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Gitter app users</em>: Gitter.im is now a part of Element, and will soon be bridged to the Matrix protocol, allowing its users to talk to other Matrix users.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Element Customers</em>: Element Customers use Element Matrix Services (EMS) to provision and manage hosted homeservers.\nApart from where otherwise noted, this document does <strong>not</strong> address data protections issues relating to the messaging and file data submitted by Users to the hosted homeserver instances, as this is the legal responsability of the Customer.\nFor general Terms of Use for Homeserver users, please see: User Terms of Service </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This document does not cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Your relationship with the Matrix server if it isn't provided by EMS</em>: Your account details and preferences, messages, files and any other data you share via the Matrix protocol are the responsibility of the Matrix server, and it is the provider of that server's job to make sure your data is handled appropriately and that you are well informed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are using the matrix.org server provided by the Matrix Foundation, you can find the relevant Privacy Notice and Terms and Conditions here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matrix.org Privacy Notice - https://matrix.org/docs/guides/privacy_notice.html </li>\n<li> \u200dMatrix.org Terms and Conditions - https://matrix.org/docs/guides/terms_and_conditions.html </li>\n<li> \u200dMatrix.org Code of Conduct - https://matrix.org/docs/guides/code_of_conduct </li>\n<li> \u200dMatrix.org Copyright Notice - https://matrix.org/docs/guides/copyright_notice </li>\n</ul> 1.2 The Customer and the User <p>This document is designed to explain Data Protections issues relating to Element Customers and Users.\nPut simply, you're a Customer if you're paying (or otherwise compensating) Element to provide a dedicated hosted messaging service.\nIf you have an account registered on a homeserver that you use to send and receive messages, or use the Element chat app to connect any server within the Matrix Protocol, you are a User.</p>\n<p>It is possible to be both a Customer and a User, but we encourage you to consider these roles separately when thinking about Data Protection concerns.</p> 1.3 Changes to This Document <p>Over time we may make changes to this document.\nIf we make a material change we will provide the Customer with reasonable notice prior to the change.\nWe will set forth the date upon which the changes will become effective.\nany use of Element by the Customer, or any use of a hosted homeserver from EMS by a User will constitute the Customer's acceptance of these changes.</p>\n<p>Your access and use of Element is always subject to the most current version of this document.<br>\n</p> 2.\nAccess to Your Data 2.1 What is the legal basis for processing my data and how does this affect my rights under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)? 2.1.1 Legal Basis for Processing <p>Element has different legal basis for processing, based on which product you are using:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Element chat app users</em>: we collect your IP address when you request access to the Element client from our web server.\nThis data is collected under <em>Legitimate Interest</em>, to support operational maintenance and to protect against malicious actions against our infrastructure.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Gitter app users</em>: we collect the details of whatever account you use to sign-up to Gitter, via OAuth (this could be GitLab/GitHub/Twitter).\nThis data is collected under <em>Legitimate Interest</em>, to allow you to use the service.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Element customers</em>: your data is processed under <em>Performance of Contract</em>.\nThis means that we process your data only as necessary to meet our contractual obligations to you, or to engage with you to do something before entering into a contract (such as providing a quote);</li>\n</ul> 2.1.2 Data Ownership - Messaging and File data within hosted homeservers <p>The Customer can use Element Matrix Services to provision and manage hosted Matrix homeservers.\nThe Customer owns and controls all messages and files submitted to their homeserver by User accounts registered natively on their homeserver.\nThis ownership does not extend to messages and files submitted over federation or bridging.<br>\n</p>\n<p>This means that, in addition to the usual data access controls defined by the Matrix protocol, all unencrypted messages and files can be accessed by the Customer, and that access is retained even if no User account within the system

Why? <p>The information we collect is for the purpose of supporting your management of hosted homeservers through Element Matrix Services, or to support operational maintenance of the Element Matrix client.\nWe do not profile homeserver Users or their data, but we might profile metadata pertaining to the configuration and management of hosted homeservers so that we can improve our products and services.<br>\n</p> 2.2.1 Information you provide to us: <p>We collect information about you when you input it to the Element or Element Matrix Services apps or otherwise provide it directly to us.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Element Matrix Services Customer Account and Profile Information</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We collect information when you register for an account.\nThis information is kept to a minimum on purpose, and is restricted to:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Authentication Identifier.\none of: <ul>\n<li>Email address and password</li>\n<li>Twitter id</li>\n<li>Google id</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Your authentication identifier is used to authenticate your access to Element Matrix Services at https://ems.host and to uniquely identify you.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Element Matrix Services (EMS) Customer Account Transaction and Billing Information</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Paying for hosted homeserver service via EMS is handled entirely by our payment processor, Stripe.\nThe processor stores your credit card information as well as your billing contact information in order to process your monthly or annual automatic renewals, or to allow you to upgrade or downgrade your subscription without re-entering a credit card number.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We never have access to, nor store your full credit card information.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The payment processor code we use also sets a cookie in your browser, to remember your info for future purchases.\nYou can delete or block that cookie if you wish.\nour website will continue to work.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We require you to enter your billing information.\nThis data, as well as the last four digits of your credit card which is sent to us by our payment processor, is stored in our transaction database in order to maintain our financial records.\nThis information appears on your invoice, which can be accessed by anyone who has been sent the url link to your invoice.\nWe make the invoice links purposefully long and hard to guess for added security, and we prevent search engines from indexing them.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The history of changes to the billing contact information on the invoice made by you or our team are logged and stored in our transaction database.<br>\n</p>\n<p>The data we collect in our transaction database, including Personal Data, is not shared with third parties, except for the purposes of determining the validity of a payment.\nIn this case we may share the name and email address associated with the purchase with the credit card holder, your company's accounting department, or with our payment processor when responding to a chargeback.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We use a third-party, Quaderno, to help us with tax automation within our billing system.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Lead generation and marketing information</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We might collect information about you through adverts placed in third-party platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter or Google.\nWhenever you click an advert on these platforms you may be asked to provide details such as:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Organisation of employment</li>\n<li>Job title</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Within each of these adverts you will be notified of the legal basis under which your data will be processed.\nThis information will be stored on our marketing automation platform Force24 and our CRM system Pipedrive, and will be processed in accordance with this policy.<br>\n</p> 2.2.2 Information we collect automatically as you use the service:<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Connect information</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We log the IP addresses of everyone who accesses Element.\nThis data is used in order to mitigate abuse, debug operational issues, and monitor traffic patterns.\nOur logs are kept for:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30 days, for EMS Customer IP addresses;</li>\n<li>180 days, for Element chat app IP addresses;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Usage Information</strong>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>We track usage data for Element hosting services.\nWhen you are signed in to your account we may track your usage of the site and associate that information with your account details.\nThis data helps us understand how our users are using the application so that we can make improvements to the Service.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Our analytics are powered by the Free and Open Source analytics platform Matomo, hosted entirely within our network.\nThe servers which host this data are located in the EEA, specifically in London, United Kingdom.\nWe don't share any analytics data with third parties.<br>\n</p>\n<p>If you are using the Element chat app, you will be asked to opt-in to this anonymised data collection.\nYour use of the Service does not rely on your opt-in to this.\nWhen using any of the Element chat clients your visit to the service will be logged, alongside your device ID and agent.\nThis allows us to understand usage patterns based on each platform.\nThe mapping of this data is logged for 28 days - from this point on only aggregated data is kept, for operational and statistical purposes.<br>\n</p>\n<p>When reporting errors we might collect some information to help us find a solution.\nThis may include your IP address, hostname, full name and e-mail address.\nThis information is collated in the application monitoring platform Sentry and is subject to strict retention policies.<br>\n</p> 2.4 Sharing Data in Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws.\nEnforcement of Our Rights<br>\n<p>\n<strong>\u200d</strong>In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to<br>\n<br>(a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,<br>\n<br>(b) protect the security or integrity of our products and services (e.g.\nfor a security audit),<br>\n<br>(c) protect Element and our users from harm or illegal activities, or<br>\n<br>(d) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the serious bodily harm of any person.<br>\n</p> 2.5 How Do You Handle Passwords?<br>\n<p>We never store password data in plain text.\ninstead they are stored hashed (with at least 12 rounds of bcrypt, including both a salt and a server-side pepper secret).\nPasswords sent to the server are encrypted using SSL.<br>\u200d<br>It is your sole responsibility to keep your user name, password and other sensitive information confidential.\nActions taken using your credentials shall be deemed to be actions taken by you, with all consequences including service termination, civil and criminal penalties.<br>\n<br>If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you must notify Element immediately by sending an email to dpo@element.io.\nUsers should manage good password hygiene (e.g.\nusing a password manager) and change their password if they believe their account is compromised.<br>\n<br>If you forget your password (and you have registered an email address) you can use the password reset facility to reset it.<br>\n</p> 2.6 Our Commitment to Children's Privacy<br>\n<p>We never knowingly collect or maintain information in Element, through any of the Services provided, from those we know are under 16, and no part of Element is structured to attract anyone under 16.\nIf you are under 16, please do not use the Service.<br>\n</p> 2.7 How Can I Access or Correct My Information?<br>\n<p>If you are a customer of Element Matrix Services (EMS) you can access all personal information that we collect by using the account management interface at https://element.io.\nYou can download a copy of all your data as per section 2.1.3.<br>\n<br>If you are a user of the Element chat app you can request a copy of your data by emailing dpo@element.io.\nWe are working on a solution which will allow you to download the data automatically.<br>\n</p> 2.8 Who Can See My Homeserver Configuration?<br>\n<p>Data stored in Element is accessible by the Customer's account and by Element engineers (employees and contractors) under the conditions outlined below.<br>\n</p> 2.9 What Are the Guidelines Element Follows When Accessing My Data?<br>\n<ul>\n<li>We restrict who at Element (employees and contractors) can access Element data to roles which require access in order to maintain the health of the Element apps and services.</li>\n<li>We never share what we see with other users or the general public.</li>\n</ul> 2.10 Who Else Has Access to My Data?<br>\n<p>We host the Element Matrix Services on Amazon Web Services (AWS), specifically:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our admin server is hosted in an AWS data centre in Amsterdam;</li>\n<li>Our deployment server is hosted in an AWS data centre in London;</li>\n<li>Customer deployments have the option to select the geographical location which is the most convenient for them;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also host the Gitter.im app on AWS, in a datacenter based in the East of the US.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Amazon employees have access to this data.\nHere's Amazon's privacy policy.\nAmazon controls physical access to their locations.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We use Cloudflare to mitigate the risk of DDoS attacks.\nHere's CloudFlare's privacy policy.<br>\n</p>\n<p>Physical access to our offices and locations use typical physical access restrictions.<br>\n</p>\n<p>We use secure private keys when accessing servers via SSH, and protect our AWS console passwords locally with a password management tool.<br>\n</p> 2.11 What happens if Element is sold?<br>\n<p>In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.<br>\n<br>If we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets.<br>\n</p> 2.12 How Is My Data Protected from Another User's Data?<br>\n<p>All of the Element user data resides within the same dedicated cluster.\nWe use software best practices to guarantee that only the Customer can access it.\nIn other words, we segment User data via software.\nWe do our best and are very confident we're doing a good job at it, but, like every other service that hosts User data on the same database, we cannot guarantee that it is immune to a sophisticated attack.<br>\n</p> 2.13 What Should I Do If I Find a Security Vulnerability in the Service?<br>\n<p>If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at security@element.io.\nWe'll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern.\nInformation security is our highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.<br>\n<br>Please act in good faith towards our users' privacy and data during your disclosure.\nWhite hat security researchers are always appreciated.<br>\n</p> 3.\nMaking a Complaint <p>We try to meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal information.\nFor this reason, we take any complaints we receive about this very seriously.\nWe encourage people to bring it to our attention at dpo@element.io if they think that our collection or use of information is unfair, misleading or inappropriate.\nWe would also welcome any suggestions for improving our procedures.<br>\n</p>\n<p>If you want to make a complaint about the way we have processed your personal information to the supervisory authority, you can contact the ICO (the statutory body which oversees data protection law) at https://www.ico.org.uk/concerns.<br>\n</p> 4.\nDocument history <ul>\n<li>2018, March 28: Policy document for public

read this document carefully before accessing or using this service!</p>1.\nIntroduction1.1 English, Not Legalese<p>Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable.\nThey are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.</p>\n<p>We decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible.\nSome sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time.</p>\n<p>When you read \u2018the matrix.org homeserver\u2019 or \u2018the Service\u2019 below, it refers to the services made available at <strong>matrix.org</strong> which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges, and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.</p>\n<p>Where you read <em>New Vector</em>, <em>New Vector Ltd.</em> or <em>we </em>or<em> us</em> below, it refers to the company we created in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core team and support Matrix\u2019s development and so run the matrix.org homeserver: New Vector Ltd., and its French subsidiary: New Vector SARL and their agents.\n<strong>This agreement does not apply to Matrix servers run by anyone else - Matrix is an open network like the Web and this agreement only applies to the server (matrix.org) provided by New Vector Ltd.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else!</p>\n<p>Contact Information:</p>\n<p>Email: support@matrix.org</p>\n<p>Postal

support@matrix.org.</p>1.2 Using The Service Means Accepting These Terms<p>By accessing or using the Service in any way, whether you have created a Matrix account on the matrix.org homeserver, or whether you are accessing content federated from the matrix.org homeserver to another Matrix homeserver, or are just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.</p>\n<p>If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else and refrain from accessing content federated from this server.</p>1.3 This Is a Living Document<p>This is a living document.\nWith your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.</p>\n<p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We\u2019re all ears! Email support@matrix.org and we\u2019ll chat.</p>\n<p>We don\u2019t amend this document for any specific users or use case, but if your proposed changes apply to all of our users, we\u2019ll be happy to update it for everyone.\nScroll to the bottom to see the history so far.</p>\n<p>We will likely improve this document over time.\nBy continuing to use the Service, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.</p>\n<p>Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.</p>1.4 Breach of Terms<p>If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Service automatically terminates.\n</p>\n<p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.\n</p>\n<p>If you think we removed your access by mistake, send an email to support@matrix.org and we\u2019ll give you our reasoning.</p>2.\nSupport<p>Support for the matrix.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by New Vector Ltd - however, support is often available from the wider Matrix Community in the public Matrix Support rooms (as listed in the +matrix:matrix.org community).</p>\n<p>Queries sent to support@matrix.org will be addressed on a best-effort basis by the paid team.\nPhone support is not provided.</p>\n<p>We love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a small team and value our work/life balance.\nThis means that although we\u2019ll try our best, we do not provide 24/7 support.</p>3.\nIntellectual Property Rights<p>\n<em>Note on Plain English: We know that the language in this section still reads like legalese - this will be improved in later

Understand how your data is used <p> The Matrix protocol is designed with your privacy and data sovereignty in mind.\nBecause it is a decentralised, federated service with cryptographically-validated message integrity, there are a few important things to know before you use the Service.\n</p>\n<p> This Service (via the Matrix homeserver hosted at https://matrix.org) is run and managed by New Vector Ltd, the company formed in July 2017 to hire the Matrix core development team.\n</p> Federation <p> Services using the Matrix protocol rely on Matrix homeservers which share user data with the wider ecosystem over federation.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> When you send messages or files in a room, a copy of the data is sent to all participants in the room.\nIf these participants are registered on remote homeservers, your username, display name, messages and files may be replicated across each participating homeserver.\n</li>\n<li> We will forget your copy of your data upon your request.\nWe will also forward your request onto federated homeservers.\nHowever - these homeservers are outside our span of control, so we cannot guarantee they will forget your data.\n</li>\n<li> Federated homeservers can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.\n</li>\n</ul> Bridging <p> Some Matrix rooms are bridged to third-party services, such as IRC networks, twitter or email.\nWhen a room has been bridged, your messages and media may be copied onto the bridged service.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> It may not be technically possible to support your management of your data once it has been copied onto a bridged service.\n</li>\n<li> Bridged services can be located anywhere in the world, and are subject to local laws and regulations.\n</li>\n</ul> Integration Services (Bots and Widgets) <p> The matrix.org homeserver provides a range of integrations in the form of Widgets (web applications accessed as part of the Matrix Client webapp) and Bots (automated participants in rooms).\nBots and Widgets have access to the messages and files in rooms in which they participate.\n</p> Forgetting your Data <p> You can request that we forget your data if you deactivate your account.\nEach user in a Matrix conversation receives their own copy of all messages and files in that conversation (similar to email), so we ensure data is forgotten by ensuring that your data is not shared further and is not visible to future users.\nOnce all users\u2019 copies have been forgotten the messages and files will be deleted from the matrix.org homeserver database.\nFor full details, please see the full privacy notice.\n</p>\n<p> If you remove (redact) a message, the message content will no longer be accessible to users.\nRedactions only remove message content, your display name and avatar - your username will still be visible.\nFederated homeservers and some matrix clients may not honour the redaction request.\n</p> Legal Basis for Processing <p> New Vector processes your data under Legitimate Interest.\nThis means that we process your data only as necessary to deliver the Service, and in a manner that you understand and expect.\n</p>\n<p> The Legitimate Interest of our Service is the provision of decentralised, openly-federated and (optionally) end-to-end encrypted communication services.\nThe processing of user data we undertake is necessary to provide the Service.\nThe nature of the Service and its implementation results in some caveats concerning this processing, particularly in terms of GDPR Article 17 Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten).\nWe believe these caveats are in line with the broader societal interests served by providing the Service.\nThese caveats are discussed in detail in the full privacy notice, but the most important restriction is that your username will still be publicly associated with rooms in which you have participated even if you deactivate your account and ask us to forget your data.\n</p>\n<p> In situations where the interests of the individual appear to be in conflict with the broader societal interests, we will seek to reconcile those differences in accordance with our policy.\n</p>\n<p> If any of the above are unacceptable to you, <b>please do not use the Service.</b>\n</p>\n<p> Please review the full privacy notice and code of conduct before using this Service.\n</p>\n<p> Please review the terms and conditions before using this Service.\n</p>\n<p> You must be at least 16 years old to use this Service (https://matrix.org) </p> ", "created_at":
