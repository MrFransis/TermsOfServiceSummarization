Action<p>These Terms and Conditions, its subject matter and Duolingo\u2019s and your respective rights under these Terms and Conditions, as well as and any claim, cause of action or dispute (\u201cclaim\u201d) arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions, shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, excluding the conflict of law provisions of that or any other jurisdiction, regardless of your country of origin or where you access the Service.\nANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except for Duolingo\u2019s right to seek injunctive relief as set forth below.\nUnless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys\u2019 fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.</p>\n<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Duolingo and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@duolingo.com within 30 days of the day you first access or use the Service.</p>\n<p>If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Duolingo\u2019s Administration Office of your intent to arbitrate (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to Duolingo should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to legal@duolingo.com.\nor (ii) sending the Notice by U.S.\nPostal Service certified mail to Duolingo, Inc., Attention:

JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) as modified by these Terms and Conditions.\nThe JAMS Rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms and Conditions.\nIf you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the JAMS Rules.\nWe will reimburse all other JAMS filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the JAMS Rules.\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language.\nJudgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nFor any claim where the potential award is reasonably likely to be $10,000 or less, either you or Duolingo may elect to have the dispute resolved through non-appearance-based arbitration.</p>\n<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, YOU AND DUOLINGO EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDING WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND DUOLINGO EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.\nIf a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and Duolingo agree that all claims arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the County of Allegheny in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and you and Duolingo each agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such claims.\nNotwithstanding the above, you agree that Duolingo shall still be allowed to apply for and obtain injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Language<p>This agreement was originally written in English (US).\nTo the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.</p>\n</li>\n<li>California Resident<p>If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00a7 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous<p>These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between Duolingo and you concerning the subject matter hereof.\nIn the event that any of the Terms and Conditions are held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, such provisions shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms and Conditions shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.\nA waiver by Duolingo or you of any provision of these Terms and Conditions or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.\nDuolingo may assign its rights or obligations under these Terms and Conditions without condition.\nThese Terms and Conditions will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of Duolingo and you, and Duolingo's and your respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>Last revised on October 22st, 2020 ", "created_at": "2018-10-12 14:16:27.241048", "updated_at": "2021-05-08

Speaking Practice<p>When you take a Live Speaking Lesson, we will use your computer's microphone throughout the lesson to speak to your tutor.\nYou also have the option of using your camera to share your video with your tutor.\nDuolingo records these audio and video lessons and retains them until you close your Duolingo account.\nDuolingo uses this data to help improve the quality of the lessons

show them your video or tell them any personal details such as your name during the conversation.\nDuolingo only shares some basic skill level information with the tutor, prior to your lesson, so they understand how best to speak to you.</p>Speaking Challenges<p>Some lessons involve you speaking into the app.\nTo recognize speech your audio may be sent to a third party provider such as Google, Apple, or Amazon Web Services.\nWe may ask you to allow Duolingo to collect and analyze your speech data to help us understand the effectiveness of our lessons, and to improve the product.\nIf you choose not to share your audio with us, or if we haven\u2019t asked you yet, then your audio will not be used in this way.\nAny audio you agree to send to Duolingo is anonymized when it reaches our servers to ensure that no trace of your personal data remains attached to the audio.</p>Test Data<p>If you register for the Duolingo English Test, you will also provide us with your gender, native language, secondary school, and self-reported test scores for other exams.\nEach time you take a test you must also provide a photo of a current, valid driver\u2019s license, passport, or other government issued ID and take a photo of your face to verify your identity (\u201c<strong>Testing ID</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>When you use the Service to take an examination in the Duolingo English

Video</strong>\u201d).\nWhile using the Duolingo English Test, you will submit answers to questions and other information as part of the testing and evaluation process.</p>\n<p>The testing software will be installed onto your computer.\nDuring the test, the testing software will monitor if additional applications are running on your computer, but will not open any applications or individual files.\nPlease close any other applications by exiting from them completely prior to starting the test.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Duolingo will be able to note if any peripherals are used during the test (i.e.\nexternal devices attached to your computer), but will not have any control or access to these peripherals.\nPlease remove these before testing if you do not wish to have their presence known.</p>\n<p>Duolingo will not open network packets, but will have access to network usage statistics and the volume of network traffic.</p>Third Party Data<p>We also collect information about you

cases, other users may be able to supplement your profile, including by submitting comments (which can be deleted by you).\nDuolingo uses this information to provide you with support, to send you essential notifications, to enforce our terms, conditions and policies, to communicate with you, to administer the Services, and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical, and survey purposes.\nDuolingo\u2019s Terms and Conditions provide the contractual lawful basis for these processing activities.</p>Duolingo English Test<p>When you

extra privacy protection.\nThat\u2019s why we treat child users differently to ensure their parents are in control and we only collect the bare minimum information we need to make Duolingo work.</p>\n<p>When a user creates a Duolingo account we collect their age and compare it to the local standard of child online consent depending on the country they registered in.\nWe refer to users under this age as \u201cchild users\u201d.\nChild users are permitted to create a user account but we ask them to provide their parent\u2019s email address instead of their own.\nWe also prevent child users from supplying their own name because we don\u2019t need that information.</p>\n<p>After registration we will send an email notifying the parent about Duolingo\u2019s privacy and information practices regarding child users, including what personal data we collect and how we use, share, and protect that personal data.\nThe email also explains how parents can request that Duolingo access, change or delete the personal data about their child.</p>\n<p>Child users receive the following special treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lessons are made age appropriate by removing mature words like \u201cbeer\u201d or \u201cwine\u201d.</li>\n<li>Advertisements are set to family safe content.</li>\n<li>The Profile page is hidden, preventing the child from stating their name, location or bio.</li>\n<li>Uploading an avatar photo is disabled.</li>\n<li>Promotional emails are disabled.</li>\n<li>Leaderboards are disabled.</li>\n<li>Discussion forums are disabled.</li>\n<li>The child\u2019s profile is made private and hidden from other users\u2019 searches.</li>\n<li>Other users are unable to follow the child.</li>\n<li>The ability to follow other users or search for other users is disabled.</li>\n<li>The ability to send an invitation email is disabled.</li>\n<li>Finding friends on Facebook is disabled.</li>\n<li>Social logins with Facebook, Google or Apple are disabled.</li>\n<li>Social follow buttons for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are disabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, all users under the age of 16 receive the following special treatment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advertisements are set to non-personalised.</li>\n<li>Third party behavioral tracking is disabled.</li>\n<li>Third party analytics is disabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To prevent restricted users from amending these features, the settings will be hidden or grayed out.\nIn the future, once we\u2019re sure the user is old enough we will automatically remove the restrictions, reset the settings to their defaults and make the settings visible for them to configure how they choose.</p>\n<p>With regards to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (\"COPPA\"), Duolingo only collects personal information from children under the age of 13 for the sole purpose of performing internal operations of the Service.\nIf we discover that we have unknowingly collected

implemented administrative and technical safeguards it believes are appropriate to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of your personal data, Testing ID, User Photo, access credentials, and Duolingo English Test results.\nHowever, given sufficient resources, a determined attacker could defeat those safeguards and may, as a result, gain access to the data we seek to protect.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Do Not Track<p>The Service is not designed to respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals sent by some browsers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Contact Us<p>Duolingo\u2019s headquarters are
