Modified: 18th December 2019\n<p>Waterfall (referred too hereafter as\n\"Waterfall\", \"us\", \"we\", or \"our\") based in the United Kingdom.\nWe try our best to be transparent about what we're\ndoing with the site, and this includes how we handle your personal data and keeping it secure.\nThis document (the \"Privacy Policy\")\nis intended to shed some light on how we treat the information you provide when you visit waterfall.social (\"the site\"), any of the blogs\nhosted on the site, or any of our other domains, products, or apps (including mobile - collectively with the site, the \"Services\").</p>\nWhat this Privacy Policy covers\n<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of data gathered when you use the Services.\nIt does not apply to the practices of third parties we do not own,\ncontrol, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (\"Third Party Services\").\nWaterfall tries\nto work only with Third Party Services with similar or compatible privacy policies, and abides by the European Union's General Data Protection Regulations.</p>\n<p>Also.\nthis doesn't cover what our users do on their blogs.\nWhile we try and prevent any tracking scripts from being added, we can't guarantee we get them all.\nWhen you visit a blog, it might collect information that we don't.</p>\nWhat We Collect and How We Use It\n<p>In the course of providing the Services, we collect and recieve various types of information.\nSome is necessary to use the Services, such as some basic analytics\ninformation on how you're using the site to provide recommendations.\nWe describe more about the information and their uses below.</p>\n<p>We rely on the following bases to lawfully collect and use your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First, we need to process your information in certain ways to provide the Services to you in accordance with our Terms of Service.\nThis processing is\nnecessary to perform the contract between you and us, and our TOS makes it clear that processing this information to provide personalised recommendations to you, and to provide\ndetailed analytics regarding selected creator's content is a necessary part of providing the Services.\nAll data provided to creators is fully anonymised.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Second, where you've given us consent to use your information in certain ways, we will rely on your continued consent.\nThis consent can be revoked at any time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third, as described below, in certain cases we might process information where necessary to further legitimate interests, whether those of ourselves, our users (such as to decide on additional site features that benefit everyone)\nor partners, but only when those interests are not overridden by your own rights or interests.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Occasionally, Waterfall may rely on other legal bases to process your information, such as to protect your vital interests or those as others (such as where there is a risk of imminent harm), where necessary in the public interest, or to comply with legal obligations.\nWhere appropriate, users will be informed of these uses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account on the Services (an \"Account\"), we ask information such as your email address, blog names, password, date of birth, etc (\"Account Information\") in order to provide\nthe Services.\nWe may use this data to allow or deny access to certain types of content, such as by using your age to prevent access to adult content, or your provided blacklist to help you avoid content you don't want to see.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can keep yourself as anonymous as you want on Waterfall, but remember that if you post something, you should, by and large, assume it's here forever, same as with anything on the Internet.\nBlogs are visible publicly by default, but you can password protect them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Email Communications:</strong> As part of the Services, you will occasionally receive email and other communications from us.\nAdministrative communications are considered\npart of the services (for example, account recovery, password reset, and emergency security notifications), which cannot be opted out of.\nOther notifications, such as\nwhen a user follows a blog you own, can be opted of from the Settings pages.\n<strong>We will never email you to ask for your password.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information about Your Accounts on Third Party Services:</strong> You can link your Account to certain Third Party Services, such as Discord.\nIn order to do so, you can choose to provide us with your username or other user ID for a Third Party Service, and you may then be required to log into that Service.\nAfter you complete this login process, we will receive a token that allows us to access your account on that service so that we can, for example, post your content to that service when you ask us to.\nWe do not receive or store your passwords for your Third Party Service accounts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>User Content:</strong> By default, all sharing through the Services is public.\nWhen you provide content to us, it is published so that anyone can view it.\nWe do have\noptions for restricted access, such as password protected blogs, blocking users, etc that allows private publishing.\nUnless you specifically select otherwise, you\nshould assume content is public.\nPlease also be aware that though you may have shared something privately with another User, they may choose to subsequently post it in a public manner.\nContent published publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines (note: when you disable your blog from being searched on the site, we also ask search engines not to index it.\nMost respect this request, though there are some that don't)\nand this may affect the control you have regarding that content.\nIn addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Services, such as reblogging.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Don't let this put you off form sharing your creations or thoughts - just understand that it can be nearly impossible to get rid of something once it's out there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Native Actions:</strong> The Services allow you to perform certain actions integral to the product, such as like, reblog, or comment on a post.\nThese are all public actions, and a record is left on the notes\nof a post.\nWe use information about native actions to improve the Services, such as by seeing which kinds of content are popular, which kinds of content have trouble spreading, etc.\nWe also use this for personalisation -\nsuch as generating blog recommendations, etc.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Financial Information:</strong> We will sometimes collect financial information, such as information related to your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information).\nWe ask for this information when you decide to purchase a paid Service.\nWe do not, however, store that financial information.\nsuch information is stored by our payment processor (the \"Payment Processor\"), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor's applicable terms of service and privacy policy.\nFor Waterfall, we use Stripe.\nWe do receive certain information from our Payment Processor - a unique token that we connect with your Account for audit and support purposes, and in the case of an artist on the Commission Market, an ID provided to us to allow directing the flow of payments.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Related to Use of the Services:</strong> We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account.\nThis type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with the Services.\nWe use internal tools and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics) to collect and analyse this information.\nSome of this information may be associated with the IP Address used to access the Services, and some may be connected with your Account, and some may only be collected and used in an aggregated and anonymised form (as a statistical measure that wouldn't identify you or your Account).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location Information:</strong> As well as your IP Address, which could be used to glean a rough location, we collect your timezone and local currency when you log in.\nWe use this to determine the correct timezone for queued posts, and the currency to present to you when purchasing blog slots or a subscription on the Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Derived Information:</strong> As described above in \"Native Actions\" and \"Information Related to Use of the Services,\" we may analyse your actions on the Services in order to derive or infer characteristics that may be descriptive of your Account (for example, what kinds of blogs you follow or what kinds of posts you view, like, or reblog).\nWe use this information for the purposes described in \"Information Related to Use of the Services\" above.</p>\nWith Whom Your Information Is Shared\n<p>We only share information when we have your permission to do so, have given prior notice (such as in this Privacy Policy), or that information is\naggregated or anonymised and does not identify you.\nYou confirm that you have all appropriate consents to upload and share the personal information of third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Shared With and Received from out Affiliates:</strong> We do not share data with any business or group external to ourselves except as outlined below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Shared with the Public through the Services:</strong> As noted above, by default, content on the Services is public.\nBecause this kind of information is\npublic and may be indexed by search engines, this information is inherently shared.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember, you can make a blog private or unsearchable in your Settings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Share with Your Consent or at Your Request:</strong> Without prejudice to your rights mentioned below, if you ask us to release information that we have about your Account, we will do so if reasonable and not unduly burdensome.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Shared with Other Third Parties:</strong> We may share or disclose public, aggregate or anonymised information with people and entities that we do business with, such as for the purposes of analytics.</p>\nSecurity and Information Retention\n<p>Protecting our systems and the information within is an uphill battle, but a necessary one.\nWe do our best to make sure everything stays\nsecure, and that the trust you put in us is deserved.</p>\n<p>Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.\nWe may enable additional security features in the future, or you\nmay elect to use any of the features provided to further enhance your security, such as Two-Factor Authentication.\nChoosing a strong, secure password is\nyour responsibility.\nWaterfall cannot see your password.</p>\n<p>Waterfall will retain account information for as long as necessary for the purposes set out above.\nYou can, at any time, close your account\nand Waterfall will, within a reasonable timeframe, delete all information that is no longer required to comply with legal requirements, provide the Services, resolve disputes, enforce other agreements, or as\notherwise permitted by law.</p>\nLegitimate Interests\n<p>Waterfall may use your data to provide, improve, and customise the Services and content we provide to you.\nThis may include the sharing of your information for such purposes and we do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests and your legitimate interests in receiving personalized content and services.\nUsing and sharing your information for such purposes is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interests of understanding how our Services are being used.\nUsing your information for the reasons described in this Privacy Policy is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services, obtaining insights into usage patterns of our Services, efficiency and interest of our Services for users.</p>\n<p>We may also use your information for safety and security purposes, including the sharing of your information for such purposes and we do so, as it is necessary to pursue our and your legitimate interests of ensuring the security of our Services, including enhancing users' protection against harassment, intellectual property infringement, spam, crime and security risks of all types.</p>\nWhat Information You Can Access\n<p>If you have a registered Account, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging in and checking your Account Settings.\nAll users, regardless of whether logged in or having an account, can remove cookies from their web browser settings.</p>\nDeleting Your Account\n<p>You can delete your account while logged in from your settings page.\nThis action cannot be undone.\nDeletion will be effective immediately, though it will take some time for some data to be cycled out of\nbackups, caches, etc.\nData that will not be scrubbed includes any reblogs of your post, and data within them.\nThose will remain on the blogs of whoever reblogged them.\nIf there's something you absolutely need gone, edit the post\nbefore deleting your account.</p>\nTransfers\n<p>Waterfall is run by a British individual, and so information is primarily collected and processed in the United Kingdom.\nHowever, we also maintain servers in Canada, which serves as a secondary\nlocation for processing and collection.\nUnder GDPR, we are permitted only to transfer information to countries outside of the EU with an adequate level of privacy protection.\nThe Adequacy Decisions made under the old Data Protection Directive remain in force,\nmeaning that Waterfall may, if ever required, transfer data between the countries of Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faeroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Uruguay.</p>\n<p>Waterfall will maintain an up to date list of server locations on this page.\nCurrently, servers are located in France, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Waterfall will not store data in the United States due to doubts over the adequacy of US Privacy Protections.</p>\nChanges to The Privacy Policy\n<p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally, so you should check in now and then.\nIf we make substantial changes, we will notify you either\nby email, staff post, or prominently posting a notice on the dashboard.</p>\nQuestions or Concerns\n<p>If you have questions regarding privacy on the Services, please contact us using the support email.\nYou are also welcome to contact us in the Discord server if a faster response is warranted.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Privacy Policy </li>\n<li> Terms Of Service </li>\n<li> Community Guidelines

the TOS <p>Please read the Terms of Services and Community Guidelines (collectively referred to here as \u201cThe Agreement\u201d) carefully before proceeding to register and account on Waterfall (referred to here as \u201cThe Site\u201d), as well as any other services that the site may offer.\n</p>\n<p>By using the services, you (\u201cSubscriber\u201d, or \u201cyou\u201d) agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of The Agreement.\nIf you don\u2019t agree, you neither should, nor are permitted to use the site.\n</p>\n<p>Waterfall is subject to European Union and United Kingdom law.</p> 2.\nModifications to this Agreement <p>Waterfall reserves the right to modify its Terms Of Service, Community Guidelines, and Privacy Policy, as well as this Agreement, by posting either a) A notice of the revisions on the Service, or b) Providing notice to you, usually via email, and otherwise through the Service.\nModifications will NOT apply retroactively.\nThe responsibility for reviewing and acting on any modifications lies with you.\n</p>\n<p>Waterfall may, on occasion, ask you to review and explicitly agree to or reject a revised version of the Agreement.\nIn such cases, modifications will become effective at the time of your acceptance of the revised Agreement.\nIf you do not agree, your account will become locked until such a time that you do, and you will not be permitted to use the Service until you agree.</p>\n<p>In cases where explicit acceptance is not sought, and notice is posted, the new Agreement will become effective fourteen days after notification is posted.\nContinuing to use the Service after this time constitutes agreement.\nIf you do not agree, you should immediately discontinue use of the Service.</p> tl;dr: The TOS can and will change as more stuff is added, more users join, and we expand.\n3.\nUse of Services Eligibility <p>To use Waterfall, provide any personal information or content to Waterfall, or otherwise use any functionality of the site, you must be of or above minimum age.\nThe minimum age to use the service is thirteen years old regardless of jurisdiction.\nYou may not, and are legally prohibited under European Union Law, use the service if you are under the age of thirteen.</p> Service Changes and Limitations <p>The Service changes frequently in terms of functionality, and the form and capabilities may change without prior notice.\nWaterfall retains the right to impose or otherwise create limits on the use of the service at its sole discretion with or without notice, and without liability.\nWe may also change, suspend, or discontinue access to or functionality of any part of the service or Content (as defined below) or Account (as defined below) at any time, at its sole discretion.\n</p> tl;dr: The site is under active development, which means things will change.\nAlso, we can and will ban you if you post stuff that's not allowed on the site.\n4.\nRegistration, URLs and Security\n<p>As a condition of using the site, you are required to create an Account, provide your age, email address, and a password.\nAdditionally you are required to provide a default blog name, which serves as your initial presence on the site and may be changed later.\nThis will take the form of a URL in the form of \"[blogname].waterfall.social\".\nEach blog must have a unique URL.\n</p>\n<p>You agree that when registering, you will provide a valid, accurate email address that you control.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials, and you should notify Waterfall immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorised use of your account.\n</p>\n<p>Waterfall uses the definition of a minor in some contexts, such as for content restrictions or NSFW content.\nWe define this by the standard of \"under 18 years old.\" </p>tl;dr GDPR mandates any information we hold is accurate.\nAlso, if you enable notifications, we need to actually be able to send them.\nWe'll also ask you to confirm your email address.\n5.\nPrivacy <p>For detailed information of how we collect and use information, see the Privacy Policy.\nBy using the Service you agree you have read and permit this usage.\n</p> 6.\nContent\n<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, the term \u201cContent\u201d means a creative expression and includes, without limitation, video, audio, photography, illustrations, animations, logos, tools, written posts, replies, code snippets, comments, information, data, text, software, scripts, executable files, graphics, Themes (as defined below), interactive features, any of which may have been generated, provided, or made accessible with or through the service.\nThe term \u201cSubscriber Content\u201d means the Content that a Subscriber submits, transfers, or otherwise provides to the Service.\nContent includes, without limitation, all Subscriber Content.\n</p>\n<p>Subscribers retain ownership and/or other applicable rights in Subscriber Content, and Waterfall retains ownership and applicable rights of all Content other than Subscriber Content.</p> tl;dr You keep ownership of any intellectual property you upload.\nWe're not interested in owning it.\n<p>You agree that, in the case of Art posts, Waterfall may create data based on the uploaded file.\nThis data is used to ensure that any future uploads to the site are not duplicated of your art (either with or without credit), and grant permission to Waterfall to automatically convert the attempted post into a reblog of your original post, enforcing credit of your work.\n</p>\n<p>Artists may mark art as able to be included in posts without forcing a reblog, such as for mood boards or other image sets.\nIn these cases, the content system will enforce adding credit to the footer of the post instead of converting it to a reblog.\n</p> tl;dr: The system will try it's best to give you credit when an art thief uploads your stuff.\n<p>When you upload content to Waterfall, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform to the requirements of any network, device or service), and create derivative works of Subscriber Content.\nThe rights you grant in this license are for the sole purpose of allowing us to operate the Service with full functionality.\n\u201cCreating derivative works\u201d in this license does not give Waterfall the right to make substantial changes or derivations, but does give the right to, for example, enable reblogging (allowing subscribers to share and add comments to Content).</p> tl;dr: Examples of the modifications and derivatives we'll make include resizing images, transcoding video to a more web-friendly format, using our own audio/video players, etc.\n<p>You also agree that this license includes rights for Waterfall to share public Content with third-parties for distribution or analysis.\n</p> tl;dr: We try and keep stuff on servers we own, but sometimes need to rent some.\nThis bit basically means we can put stuff on those servers until we have the capacity in house.\nIt DOESN'T cover us selling your data, which we don't do.\n<p>Note also that this license to your Subscriber Content continues even if you stop using the Services, primarily because of the social nature of Content shared through Waterfall.\nWhen you post something publicly, others may choose to comment on it or share it, making the Content part of a conversation that cannot later be erased without censoring the content of others.\n</p>\n<p>You also agree to respect the intellectual property rights of others, and represent and warrant you are able and willing to grant this license to us for any Content transferred to us.</p>\n<p>As a Subscriber to the Service, Waterfall grants you a worldwide, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable licence to view, download, store, perform, redistribute and create derivative works of Content solely in connection with your use of, and in strict accordance with the functionality of the site.\nThis means, for example, that Content is licenced to you for the purposes of reblogging.\n</p>\n<p>You agree you will not violate the Community Guidelines.\nYou agree that if you upload or post content contravening these Guidelines, Waterfall may terminate your account and prevent access.\nYou further\nagree that purchasing a Premium Subscription or any other Paid Service on the site does not grant a waiver of the Guidelines, and that account termination shall not result in a refund, except at Waterfall's sole discretion.</p>\n<p>On termination of your account, or upon deletion of particular pieces of Subscriber Content from the service, Waterfall shall make reasonable efforts to make such Subscriber Content inaccessible\nand cease use of it, and, if required, delete your Account data and/or Subscriber Content, unless permitted or required to keep this data by law.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that a) deleted\nSubscriber Content may persist in cache or backups for a period of time and b) copies of or references to the Subscriber Content may not be entirely removed (due to reblogs, for example).\n</p>\n<p>Any Content uploaded of an adult or sexual nature must be clearly marked as such, such as by including the tag \u201cNSFW\u201d.\nAdditional personalised NSFW tags are permitted, but NSFW posts MUST use the standard \"nsfw\" nomenclature for filtering purposes.\nBlogs consisting primarily of adult or sexual content should flag themselves as NSFW in the settings page for that blog.\nThe Service permits any and all adult and sexual content that is legal under the jurisdictions above.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>
