warranty.\nThis PSW provision modifies the Limited Warranty provision set forth above for those Merchants that are enrolled in and have purchased a service package that includes a PSW.\nSecurityMetrics represents and warrants that SecurityMetrics PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance Services will be performed in accordance and comply with the PCI DSS as amended or HIPAA as amended from time to time.\nSecurityMetrics provides a PSW to a Merchant only for Services actually purchased by the Merchants.</li>\n<li>Exclusions.\nThis PSW excludes incorrect data, information, or policies

Services, any security and privacy trainings sold by SecurityMetrics, and any services performed by a Qualified Security Assessor, Payment Application Qualified Security Assessor, Point-to-Point Encryption Qualified Security Assessor, Payment Card Industry Forensic Investigator, penetration tester, or an employee supervised by one of the above-mentioned specialists.</li>\n<li>A Merchant that is enrolled in SecurityMetrics' PCI or HIPAA compliance services that includes a PSW, and suffers a data breach as a result of a failure of such SecurityMetrics' Services, will be reimbursed by

Limitations.\n<p>The PSW is not available to level 1 Merchants, as level 1 Merchants are defined by the card brands.\nThe PSW is only available to Merchants located in the United States and Canada and

up to $100,000 (the \"PSW Limit\") per Merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification,) subject to the terms and limitations described more fully below.\nSecurityMetrics will reimburse Merchants only for the following costs and expenses actually incurred as a result of a failure of SecurityMetrics' Services to comply with PCI DSS and HIPAA, and that are timely reported according to Section 5 below by Merchants in connection with a properly reported data breach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Penalties or fines charged to Merchant by Visa, MasterCard,

costs, victim cost reimbursement, or identity theft monitoring and services.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The Program is Not Insurance.\n<p>The PSW is not insurance.\nNeither Merchants nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship receives insurance as a result of the PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement.\nNeither the Merchant nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship is an \"insured\" or beneficiary under any insurance policy.\nNothing in PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement creates an insurance relationship between Acquirer or the merchant and AIG (or any other AIG affiliate).\nSecurityMetrics is not providing Merchants or any entity with which Merchants have a relationship with insurance pursuant to a contractual agreement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>The Program Limit.\n<p>The PSW Limit is the most any Merchant can recover for each merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification) during a twelve (12) month period for any or all such costs or expenses, combined, and regardless of the number of data security events discovered or regulatory actions taken.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Notification.\n<p>Merchants are required to provide SecurityMetrics notice within thirty (30) days of discovery or suspicious of a breach or compromise.\nA Merchant is required to provide SecurityMetrics with any documentation, invoice, or other evidence required by SecurityMetrics within thirty (30) days after receipt of this documentation, invoice, or other evidence.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Reporting.\n<p>The PSW reimburses Merchants only if a Merchant provides a timely (within 30 days) notification and complete report of a data security event or regulatory action as soon as the Merchant becomes aware of such event or action.\nMerchants will need to provide details on the data security event or regulatory action including, but not limited to: a complete description of the data security event or regulatory action, all documents relating to the data security event or regulatory action, and any other pertinent information requested by or on behalf of SecurityMetrics.\nTo report a data security event or regulatory action under the Program, contact SecurityMetrics at: Breach_Reporting@securitymetrics.com.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Reimbursement Process.\n<ol>\n<li>Merchants must provide invoices of costs described in Section 1 above to SecurityMetrics in a timely manner\u2013within 30 days.\nMerchants may email SecurityMetrics at the email address above, or by certified mail to 1275 West 1600 North, Orem, Utah 84057.</li>\n<li>Once an invoice is received by SecurityMetrics, SecurityMetrics will determine whether the PSW applies to the Merchant's breach or compromise.\nIf SecurityMetrics determines that the PSW applies and SecurityMetrics will reimburse the Merchant in accordance with the PSW terms, then SecurityMetrics will provide the Merchant with the reimbursement in a reasonable time.\nIf SecurityMetrics determines that the PSW doesn't apply, then SecurityMetrics will notify the Merchant that no reimbursement is available.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Limitation of Liability for the Program.\n<p>Merchants assume sole responsibility and liability for making timely and complete claims under the PSW, providing necessary or requested data and information, and otherwise complying with the terms and conditions set forth in the PSW.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> Scanning Abuse <p>SecurityMetrics, Inc., is a PCI Approved Scanning Vendor under certificate number 3707-01-08 and performs security
