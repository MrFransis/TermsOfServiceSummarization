controversies related to these Terms, your use<br>\nof the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise<br>\nrelated to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether<br>\ncontractual or non-contractual, that are not subject to mandatory<br>\narbitration under <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>.</p>\n<p>4.\n<u>Mandatory Binding Arbitration</u>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<br>\n<i>(a) Agreement to Arbitrate</i>\n<br>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>Any claims, disputes or controversies related to these Terms, your<br>\nuse of the App or any Content provided through the App, or otherwise<br>\nrelated to the relationship between you and WiFi Map, whether based<br>\nin contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other<br>\nlegal theory, regardless of when they arise and regardless of any<br>\ntermination of these Terms, shall be determined by mandatory binding<br>\nindividual (not class) arbitration.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her<br>\nown jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the<br>\nexistence, scope or validity of the this agreement to arbitrate or<br>\nto the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.\nArbitration is<br>\nmore informal than a lawsuit in court.\nTHERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN<br>\nARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.<br>\nThere may be more limits on the availability and scope of discovery<br>\nthan in court.\nThe arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award<br>\nthe same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees),<br>\nexcept that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including<br>\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties<br>\nto the arbitration.\nThis arbitration provision will survive<br>\ntermination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<br>\n<i>(b) Exceptions</i>\n<br>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding <u>Section&nbsp;4(a)</u>, nothing in these Terms,<br>\nincluding this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>, will be deemed to waive,<br>\npreclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to<br>\n(i)&nbsp;bring an individual action in a U.S.\nsmall claims court for<br>\na matter within the jurisdiction of that court or (ii)&nbsp;bring an<br>\nindividual action seeking only temporary or preliminary<br>\nindividualized injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final<br>\nruling from the arbitrator.\nIn addition, the agreement to arbitrate<br>\nin this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u> doesn\u2019t stop you or us from bringing<br>\nissues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nThose<br>\nagencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your<br>\nbehalf (or vice versa).</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<br>\n<i>\n<br>\n(c) No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver<br>\n</i>\n<br>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>YOU AND WIFI MAP EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN<br>\nYOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS<br>\nMEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nUnless both<br>\nyou and WiFi Map agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more<br>\nthan one person\u2019s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a<br>\nrepresentative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award<br>\ninjunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking<br>\nrelief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted<br>\nby that party\u2019s individual claim.\nIf a court decides that applicable<br>\nlaw precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph\u2019s limitations as<br>\nto a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that<br>\nclaim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in<br>\ncourt.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<br>\n<i>(d) Arbitration Rules</i>\n<br>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>Either you or WiFi Map may start arbitration proceedings.\nAny<br>\narbitration between you and WiFi Map will take place in the English<br>\nlanguage under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American<br>\nArbitration Association (\u201c<u>AAA</u>\u201d) then in force (the \u201c<br>\n<u>AAA Rules</u>\u201d), as modified by this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u>.\nThe<br>\nFederal Arbitration Act shall apply to, and govern the<br>\ninterpretation and enforcement of, this provision (despite the<br>\nchoice of law provision above).\nThe AAA Rules, as well as<br>\ninstructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA,<br>\nappear at adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nWiFi<br>\nMap can also help put you in touch with the AAA.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish)<br>\nof your residence, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or<br>\nless, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted<br>\n(i)&nbsp;solely on the basis of documents submitted to the<br>\narbitrator.\n(ii)&nbsp;through a non-appearance based telephonic<br>\nhearing.\nor (iii)&nbsp;by an in-person hearing as established by the<br>\nAAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence.</p>\n<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required<br>\nto pay a filing fee, WiFi Map will reimburse you for that filing<br>\nfee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case<br>\nyou will be responsible for the filing fee.\nWiFi Map will pay any<br>\nother arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator<br>\ncompensation, unless otherwise required by the AAA Rules or court<br>\norder.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is<br>\nconducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision<br>\nsufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on<br>\nwhich the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may<br>\nmake rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and<br>\nreimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding<br>\nand upon request from either party made within 14 days of the<br>\narbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<br>\n<i>(e) Notice.\nProcess</i>\n<br>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written<br>\nnotice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail, Federal<br>\nExpress, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or if we do not<br>\nhave a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\u201c<br>\n<u>Notice</u>\u201d).\nWiFi Map\u2019s address for Notice is: WiFi Map LLC,<br>\nAttn: President, 25 Broadway, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10004, USA.<br>\nThe Notice must (i)&nbsp;describe the nature and basis of the claim<br>\nor dispute.\nand (ii)&nbsp;set out the specific relief sought (\u201c<br>\n<u>Demand</u>\u201d).\nYou and WiFi Map each shall use good faith efforts<br>\nto resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement<br>\nto do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or WiFi<br>\nMap may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration,<br>\nthe amount of any settlement offer made by you or WiFi Map shall not<br>\nbe disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a<br>\nfinal decision and award, if any.\nAll documents and information<br>\ndisclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly<br>\nconfidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient<br>\nfor any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the<br>\nenforcement of the arbitrator\u2019s decision and award and shall not be<br>\ndisclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know<br>\nfor such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<u>\n<br>\n<i>(f) Enforceability</i>\n<br>\n</u>\n</p>\n<p>If the agreement to arbitrate in this <u>Section&nbsp;4</u> is<br>\ninvalidated in whole or in part, the exclusive jurisdiction and<br>\nvenue described in <u>Section&nbsp;3</u> shall govern any claim in<br>\ncourt arising out of or
