screen resolution, operating system version, CPU and memory configuration of your machine, and other configuration information<br> The number of tabs you have open (but not the sites you have open in those tabs)<br>\nIf you open a window in \"Privacy\" or \"Incognito\" mode, no data from that window will be collected or sent to Cocoon, and all data from that window including history and cache generated by activity in that window will be deleted as soon as you close that window.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Information Collection, Use and Disclosure</b>\n<br> Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our services, features, and content.<br> Your Personal Information.\nWhen you communicate with us or use Cocoon Properties, we may collect personal information about you.\nFor instance, if you email us requesting support, you\u2019ll provide us with your email address so we can respond to you.\nPersonal Information can also include, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, IP address, or home address.\n(We might not ask you for all or any of these things, but you might provide them to us without our asking \u2013 for instance, in an email to us.) We use your Personal Information to provide the Services and to respond to your requests for support.<br> Pseudonymous Information.\nWe also collect other information that you provide or that is provided to us about you when using Cocoon Properties (e.g., without limitation, what search engine(s) you use, and your individual preferences, your interest data when signing up for our mobile apps, etc.) (\"Pseudonymous Information\").\nWe may also collect Pseudonymous Information about your age, gender, and city or zip code when you log into the product or even if you've just downloaded the product, but have yet to register.\nThis information on its own generally isn\u2019t enough to identify you specifically.\nAll this information is considered Pseudonymous Information.<br>\n<br>\n<b>How We Use Your Information.</b>\n<br> Aggregating Information.\nWe may aggregate the Pseudonymous Information we collect with similar information collected from other Cocoon Users to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of Cocoon Properties, and to analyze and understand how Cocoon Properties are used.\nWe may also use information you provide without aggregating it to serve you specifically.\nfor instance, to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.<br> Demographic Profiling.\nWe might also use non-aggregated information for development or demographic profiling purposes, but any such use would not be personally identifiable.\nFor instance, we might combine the information Facebook sends us about your age, gender and ZIP code with the data Cocoon sends us about your usage habits to find out more about which groups of people use specific Browser features.\nAs an example, we might do this to get a sense of how many people aged 18-21 use the incognito feature, but not who those people actually are.<br> Newsletters and Marketing.\nWe also may use your Personal Information to contact you with Cocoon newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you, either generally or in your capacity as a Cocoon.com member.\nIf you decide at any time you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or contact us as explaining in Your Data Protection Rights section below.<br> Log Data.\nWhen you visit the Cocoon Web Sites (like www.GetCocoon.com), whether you\u2019re using Cocoon or as a non-registered user just visiting, our servers automatically record information your browser sends whenever you visit a website (\"Log Data\").\nThis is different from the information Cocoon will send included in the \"Please Read This Carefully\" section at the top of this Policy.\nhere, we\u2019re talking about information that\u2019s automatically collected by our web server in order to show you pages on the Cocoon Web Sites.\nThis data is collected whether or not you use Cocoon, but only when you visit our website.\nThis Log Data may include information such as your computer\u2019s Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to our Sites, pages of our Sites that you visit, the time spent on those pages, the information you search for on our Sites, access times and dates, and other statistics.\nWe use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Sites and the Service and for the Sites\u2019 technical administration, to increase our Sites\u2019 functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors\u2019 needs.\nWe also use this information to verify that visitors to the Sites meet the criteria required to process their requests.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Opt-Out</b>\n<br> Certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d) AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads.\nYou can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program here: http://www.youradchoices.com.\nIn addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).\nThe NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI members\u2019 ad networks.\nTo learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.<br> You may opt-out of providing your location information to us when you are using mobile devices.\nIf you do not want us to use your location information as described in this Privacy Policy, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your account settings (if available) or in your mobile device settings.\nPlease refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your mobile device and mobile browser settings.<br> If you do not want our mobile applications to collect any information from you, you should uninstall the application using the standard uninstall procedures that may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network where you obtained the mobile application.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Cookies</b>\n<br> Like many websites, we may use \"cookies\" to collect information.\nA cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer\u2019s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.\nWe use cookies for two purposes.\nFirst, we may use persistent cookies to authorize you and ensure that only approved Cocoon.com members may use the service.\nSecond, we may use session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Sites, to better understand how you interact with the Sites, and to monitor aggregate usage by Cocoon Users and web traffic routing on the Sites.\nUnlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Sites and Service and then close your browser.\nWe have no third-party advertisers on our Sites today.\nYou can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any websites you visit.\nIf you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Sites or all functionality of the Services.\nTo opt-out of certain cookies and for more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices and/or http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp .<br>\n<br>\n<b>Information Sharing and Disclosure</b>\n<br> Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.\nCocoon cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law.\nWe may disclose information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties that we believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal processes (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Cocoon or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.\nWe may also transfer your Personal Information to third-party service providers that assist us with carrying out the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.\nLastly, we may disclose your Personal Information for any other purpose to which you Consent.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Business Transfers</b>\n<br> In the event Cocoon (or any of its affiliates) goes through a business transition, such as a merger, consolidation, restructuring, acquisition by another company, sale or assignment of rights or assets or a portion thereof, or other company change, we may transfer users\u2019 information, including Personal Information, and other business data in connection with that business transition (e.g., to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of Cocoon, or any affiliates and trusted agents, service providers, or partners thereof), including during the course of any due diligence process.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Security</b>\n<br> Cocoon is very concerned with safeguarding your information.\nWe employ appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access.<br>\nCocoon uses physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases to help protect the security of information.\nFor example, we restrict access to your information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services.\nHowever, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.\nTherefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Retention</b>\n<br> We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).<br>\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Your Data Protection Rights</b>\n<br>\nData protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others.\nRegardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.\nWhen we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint.\nWe work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Our Policy Toward Children</b>\n<br>\nWe do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.\nIf a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@getcocoon.com.\nIf we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.<br>\n<b>Under the GDPR rules MyData Rewards users have the following rights:</b>\n<br>\nThe right to know what personal data is collected <br>\nThe right to know if personal data is being shared, and with whom<br>\nThe right to access your personal data<br>\nThe right to exercise your privacy rights without being discriminated against<br> To exercise any of these
