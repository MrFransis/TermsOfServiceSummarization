a live feed by RSC staff within our Facilities Management and Hospitality teams.\nOff-site/remote access to surveillance footage is only granted to designated staff and is provided securely through our IT system, subject to our off-site working practices and policies.</p>\n<p>Surveillance cameras are located in public access areas such as meeting rooms, post rooms, corridors, cafes, canteens, libraries, stairs, lifts, reception areas and fire exits.\nSurveillance cameras on these sites record images only.\nthere is no recording of sound.</p>\n<p>Designated RSC staff have 24 hour access to the surveillance feeds and may access them during out of office hours in the case of an emergency, incident or alarm activation at our sites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Surveillance footage is stored securely for a period of 60 (sixty) days in our UK based servers, after which time the surveillance footage is automatically deleted.</p>\n<p>In the event of an incident or accident at either site, the footage may be downloaded by our staff and stored securely on our UK based servers in the interests of preserving evidence for any potential investigation and/or claim(s).\nAny such downloaded footage may also be shared with the relevant authorities, including the police, where we are required to do so by law.\nWe may retain footage that is downloaded and/or stored for these purposes for a period up to 6 (six) years to take into account the statutory limitation periods for any potential investigation(s) and claim(s).\nOnce any potential investigation(s) or claim(s) has concluded, we will delete the relevant footage.</p>\n<p>Access to the surveillance footage is limited to staff and those third party contractors that are required to perform maintenance and servicing of the surveillance camera equipment, including ADT Fire and Security PLC (\u201cADT\u201d).\nADT are our chosen third party contractors for this service at both sites, however, alternative third party contractors in the same industry may be used by us to maintain and service our surveillance camera equipment in the event of an emergency or a change in our requirements.\nADT, or any such third party contractor, will not have access to the surveillance footage off-site/remotely.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nCookies\nWhat is a cookie?\n<p>A cookie is text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website\u2019s server.\nEach

subsidiary companies located around the world.\nThis Statement establishes our global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our websites and applications.\nThe country in which you are doing business with us or where the website you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal data.</p>\n<p>On occasion, the information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA).\nBy way of example, this may happen where any of our servers or those of our third party service providers are from time to time located in a country outside of the EEA.\nThese countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK.\nWhere possible, we will seek to work with service providers whose servers are located within the EEA.</p>\n<p>If we transfer your information outside of the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected as outlined in this policy.\nThese steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal information or ensuring that the recipients are subscribed to \u2018international frameworks\u2019 that aim to ensure adequate protection.</p>\n<p>We have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used.\nYou can contact us at&nbsp;DPO@rsc.org&nbsp;for the details as to how we protect specific transfer of your data.</p> Children\u2019s Data\n<p>We recognise any individual under the age of 18 years old as being a child.\nWe take safeguarding of children (including the protection of their personal data) seriously and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that children are provided with sufficiently clear information on how we will collect, process and store their personal data, and that children&nbsp;and their guardians understand the nature of the processing of their personal data together with their rights in respect of the same.</p>\n<p>Save for photography and filming, children under 18 years old may be able to provide consent in their own right to the processing of their personal data depending on their maturity and ability to understand the nature of the processing of that data.\nWe will take reasonable steps to assess a child\u2019s maturity and ability to understand the nature of data processing before determining whether a child can reasonably consent to processing in their own right.\nFurther information on how we will assess a child\u2019s ability to consent in their own right can be supplied on request via our contact details above.</p> Special categories of personal data\n<p>We may collect special categories of personal data if it is provided to us by you, or on your behalf, with your consent and it is appropriate to the service that we will provide to you.\nBy giving us this information, you agree that we may use such data as set out in this Statement.</p> Data anonymisation and aggregation\n<p>We may anonymise or aggregate your personal information in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it, in order to use the anonymised or aggregated data, for example, for statistical analysis and administration including analysis of trends, to carry out actuarial work, to tailor products and services and to conduct risk assessment and analysis of costs and charges in relation to our products and services.\nWe may share anonymised or aggregated data with third parties.</p> Your rights\n<p>We also offer the following controls:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You may request access to, or copies of, the personal data that we hold about you.\nIf you would like to exercise this right, please contact us at DPO@rsc.org or the RSC designated address above;</li>\n<li>If you believe that any data we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, or have concerns as to how we are using your data please contact us at DPO@rsc.org as soon as possible.\nWe will take steps to seek to correct or update any data if we are satisfied that the data we hold is inaccurate.</li>\n<li>You may request that your personal data is deleted, where it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it is being processed and provided there is no other lawful basis for which we may continue to process such data;</li>\n<li>If we are processing your personal data to meet our legitimate interests, you may object to such processing.\nIf we are unable to demonstrate our legitimate grounds for that processing, we will no longer process your personal data for those purposes;</li>\n<li>You may withdraw any consent given to processing (this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal).\nor</li>\n<li>If we are processing your personal data automatically, for the purposes of performing our contract with you, or based on your consent you may have the right to request that the personal data we hold about you be transferred to a third party data controller.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection regulation, you may lodge a complaint with the&nbsp;Information Commissioner\u2019s Office.</p> Retention\n<p>We have criteria in place in relation to how we determine the period for which we use your personal data, as well as a process for their deletion at the end of the relevant retention period.\n&nbsp;For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above.\n&nbsp;In certain circumstances, we may be required to retain your personal data for longer where such retention is required by law or record-keeping requirements, including managing our relationship with you, defending any claims, or for tax purposes.</p> Changes to this Statement\n<p>This statement is not a contract, and it does not create any legal rights or obligations.\nWe may change this Statement from time to time in order to reflect changes in the law and/or our privacy practices.\nWe will update the date at the top of the Statement accordingly.\nWe encourage you to regularly check this Statement online for changes.</p> Help &amp.\nlegal <ul>\n<li> Help </li>\n<li> Legal <ul>\n<li>\n<b>\n</b>Terms of use </li>\n<li>\n<b>\n</b>Modern Slavery Act statement
