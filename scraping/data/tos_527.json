Privacy policy Team Qwant Last update : 22/10/2020 <p>Below is Qwant\u2019s Privacy Policy, which is the result of many discussions and thoughts that have resulted in a constant evolution of our requirements for our users.\nIn particular, following our discussions with the CNIL, and in light of the opinion of European data protection authorities on anonymization techniques, we want to explain to you in as much detail as possible the specific measures we take to protect and respect the confidentiality of your data.\nIn accordance with our historical commitments to defend and promote all the regulatory recommendations of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and because we believe that it is our responsibility to you, Qwant has chosen, through this Privacy Policy, to impose on itself a high standard of data protection, transparency and legal rigor.\nAt Qwant, the concept of privacy is an essential notion and a reality, and for this we have adopted technical data protection measures and a level of transparency that we believe is unmatched by our competitors.</p>\n<p>Qwant is committed to protecting your privacy, and that\u2019s at the heart of our philosophy.\nWhat you do with Qwant is your privacy and we don\u2019t want to know about it.\n<strong>We don\u2019t keep your search history</strong> and <strong>we don\u2019t create an advertising profile to target you</strong>.\nWith Qwant, you are of course entitled to the rights guaranteed by the European General Data Protection Regulation of April 27, 2016, known as the \u201cGDPR\u201d, but most importantly, we ensure maximum respect for the principles of data minimization and \u201cprivacy by design\u201d, i.e., we implement design methods for our services that allow us to collect and process only the data that is strictly necessary.\nWe <strong>never try to find out who you are</strong> or what you do personally when you use our search engine.</p>\nHow does Qwant protect your privacy?\n<p>When you use Qwant as a search engine, <strong>we do not set any advertising cookie</strong> on your browser, nor do we look at what you personally searched for previously.\nWhen you make a query, it is immediately pseudonymized using the methods set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We also undertake to make every effort to guarantee the security and confidentiality of our users\u2019 personal data and in particular to prevent such data from being altered, deleted or accessed by unauthorized third parties.\nThe URL of Qwant begins with \u201cHTTPS\u201d, which indicates to users that they are communicating their data securely through the TLS protocol.\nTechnically, the TLS guarantees visitors that their data cannot be intercepted while in transit over the network in a fraudulent or accidental manner.\nIn addition, the padlock that appears in front of the Qwant URL on most browsers certifies that you are browsing a secure site.</p>\n<p>By default, we do not install any cookie on your browser.\nWe use your browser\u2019s \u201clocal storage\u201d technology to store your browser settings (language, enabling or disabling options) on your device.\nIf you change these technical parameters, a cookie may be installed on your browser, exclusively for the purpose of preserving these parameters.\nYou have the possibility to delete the \u201clocal storage\u201d data or the cookie from your browser.</p>\n<p>However, the provision of a search engine requires some data processing.\nThe following section of this Privacy Policy is therefore intended to explain in detail when we need to process information about you, why we collect certain data, the methods we use to pseudonymize data, how we use it, and the identity of our partners when data is transferred to them.\nIt also reminds you of your rights and how to exercise them with Qwant.</p>\nWhat data is processed by Qwant when you make search queries?\nIndexing data from the Web\n<p>In order to have knowledge of the existing contents on the Web and to offer you the most relevant results, Qwant automatically indexes Web pages on which personal data of any kind is likely to be present.\nQwant retains this data until two years after the last indexing by our robots, based on our legitimate interest in having an index of publicly available content on the Web (article 6.1.f of the GDPR).</p>\n<p>You have the right to erase these data (see below, section \u201cRight to be forgotten\u201d).</p>\nProcessing of our users\u2019 queries\n<p>To respond to the query by displaying results and ads matching your search, as well as for security and reliability purposes of its services (detection of spam, automated activity, fraudulent clicks on ads\u2026), Qwant processes the following data:</p>\n<p>\u2013 The entered keywords;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Information about the browser you use (the User Agent);</p>\n<p>\u2013 Session preferences information (if you use Qwant set up for the results in France and with the user interface in the French language, for example);</p>\n<p>\u2013 A salted hash of the user\u2019s IP address with the salt that changes ever three months at the latest (i.e.\nthe result of a mathematical formula based on this IP address, not the IP address itself);</p>\n<p>\u2013 The approximate geographic area of origin of the search at the scale of a region or a city (as deduced from the IP address)</p>\n<p>Qwant retains for 7 days the keyword(s) entered associated with a pseudonym identifier calculated from the User Agent of your browser and the salted hash of your IP address.\nAfter this period, the keywords are no longer associated to an identifier and are retained for 12 months for aggregate statistical analysis (e.g.\nto know how many times a keyword is searched over a given period of time).</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and meets Qwant\u2019s legitimate interest (article 6.1.f of the GDPR) to secure and make its services reliable.</p>\n<p>In order to provide you with relevant results from around the world when we do not have the answers to your queries by ourselves, we have partnered with Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited to provide a portion of our search results and provide contextual advertising based on the keywords entered and your geographic region.</p>\n<p>For this purpose, as well as for the security and reliability of our partner\u2019s services (detection of spam, automated activity, fraudulent clicks on ads\u2026), Qwant may transfer to this partner the following pseudonymous data related to your query:</p>\n<p>\u2013 The searched keywords;</p>\n<p>\u2013 The type and version of the browser used (User Agent);</p>\n<p>\u2013 The first three bytes of your IP address;</p>\n<p>\u2013 The approximate geographical area at the origin of the search, at the scale of a region or a city;</p>\n<p>\u2013 A salted hash generated from: your IP address, your User Agent and a salt that changes at least every 3 months.</p>\n<p>This data is transferred to this partner within the European Union, and may be retained in accordance with Bing\u2019s Privacy Policy for a maximum duration of 18 months.</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us), and responds to the legitimate interest of Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited (article 6.1.f) to make its services secure and reliable.</p>\nStatistics and audience measurement\n<p>To evaluate its audience and understand the use of its services in order to improve them, Qwant also keeps other data related to your use of the services (associated for 7 days with a hash calculated from your IP address and the User Agent of your browser) including :</p>\n<p>\u2013 The source of the user\u2019s visit to the site (the HTTP referrer and the search field used to trigger the request);</p>\n<p>\u2013 Information about the type of link clicked (for example the position of the clicked link in the results with the number of results proposed);</p>\n<p>\u2013 Some information deduced from your User Agent (type of browser, operating system, major version of the browser,\u2026)</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary for the purposes of Qwant\u2019s legitimate interest in developing statistics and measuring its audience, based on article 6.1.f of the GDPR.</p>\nManagement of registered users accounts\n<p>Qwant does not require you to register to use the search engine.\nHowever, you may wish to register to log in and personalize services.\nYou are free to manage your account information (modify, correct, update and delete information).</p>\n<p>In order to manage its users\u2019 accounts and to send our newsletter (if you have chosen to subscribe), Qwant collects the following data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information about the user preferences (if you use Qwant set up for the results in France and with the user interface in the French language, for example);</li>\n<li>Hash of your user password;</li>\n<li>E-mail address of the user;</li>\n<li>Optional data when entered by the user (name, firstname, city, website\u2026)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This data is retained by Qwant for the duration of the existence of your user account in order to allow its proper functioning.\nThey are then deleted after 7 days from the account deletion request.\nDuring this period, you have the possibility to reactivate your account using your initial login and password.</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us).</p>\n<strong>Management of requests for information filed on the site</strong>\n<p>In order to process our users\u2019 requests for information entered from a contact form, Qwant may collect the following data:</p>\n<p>\u2013 Your name and surname;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Your contact email address;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Any other personal data provided by the user.</p>\n<p>Qwant will delete this data within 6 months of receiving the request.</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary for the performance of Qwant\u2019s Terms of Use, on the basis of article 6.1.b of the GDPR (processing necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us).</p>\n<strong>Job application management</strong>\n<p>In order to process job applications received from our recruitment forms, Qwant may collect the following data:</p>\n<p>\u2013 Curriculum vitae;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Last name, first name;</p>\n<p>\u2013 E-mail address;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Postal address;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Phone number;</p>\n<p>\u2013 Any other personal data provided by the candidate.</p>\n<p>This data is kept for a maximum of two years from the last exchange with the candidate.</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary for the purposes of Qwant\u2019s legitimate interest in processing your applications, on the basis of article 6.1.f of the GDPR, in compliance with your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>\nManagement of delisting requests\n<p>In order to process requests related to the exercise of rights related to personal data as well as requests for removal of unlawful content, Qwant may collect the following data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name and surname;</li>\n<li>Proof of identity ;</li>\n<li>Contact e-mail address ;</li>\n<li>IP address of the reporting person (when reporting illicit content);</li>\n<li>Any other personal data provided by the applicant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With respect to data collected in the context of a request you make to Qwant (delisting, rights to your personal data, illegal content), the retention period is set in accordance with the regulations applicable to each of these rights.\nFor more details, you can refer to the following section entitled \u201cWhat are your rights and how to exercise them?\u201d.</p>\n<p>This processing is necessary to comply with the legal obligations imposed on Qwant, on the basis of article 6.1.c of the GDPR.</p>\nWhat are your rights and how to exercise them?\n<p>Data protection regulation grants you specific rights over your data and its processing by Qwant, which are as follows and as detailed below:</p>\n<p>\u2013 right of access, rectification and deletion of data under the conditions provided for by the regulations (articles 15 to 17 of the GDRP);</p>\n<p>\u2013 the right to object to processing under the conditions provided for by the

to data portability (Article 20 of the GDPR);</p>\n<p>\u2013 the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (Article 13 of the GDPR).\nand</p>\n<p>\u2013 right to define directives in the

authority), with whom you can exercise each of these rights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>by writing by mail to QWANT \u2013 Direction Ethique &amp.\nAffaires Juridiques, Crystal Park building, 63 Rue de Villiers, 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine, France ;</li>\n<li>or by e-mailing dpo@qwant.com</li>\n</ul>\nRight to access\n<p>You can ask us directly whether we hold data about you and also information about their
