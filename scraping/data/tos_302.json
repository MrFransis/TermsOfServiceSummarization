refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual, and non-personal data (\u201cNon-Personal Data\u201d) refers to any information that does not identify you as a specific individual.\nPlease note that at all times Indeed will adhere to the applicable statutory definition in determining what is and is not Personal Data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\nWhere this Privacy Policy refers to \u201cinformation\u201d or \u201cyour information\u201d this may include both Personal and Non-Personal Data.</p>\n<p>The Sites are made available for use only by individuals searching for employment openings, or services or information related to their personal employment or job search (\u201cJob Seekers\u201d).\nWhere applicable, the Sites may also be

for 30 days prior to such use or by other means as required by law.</p>\n<strong>1.5 Indeed\u2019s <strong>Privacy FAQ</strong>\n</strong>\n<p>Please note this Privacy Policy describes, in a comprehensive manner, how Indeed processes your data.\nFor more information on Indeed\u2019s approach to the GDPR, CCPA, and privacy generally, please visit Indeed\u2019s Privacy FAQ.</p>\n<strong> 2.\nInformation Collected</strong>\n<p>You provide different types of information in order for Indeed to provide our Sites\u2019 services, products and features to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>2.1 Information You Provide to Indeed</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 From Your Account</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect data from you when you create an account, request information, subscribe for a service, participate in a survey, post a rating or review, post a question or answer, post a resume, complete an Indeed Assessment, upload content or otherwise actively send us data on our Sites.\nThis may include, but is not limited to, your user name, password, first and last name, email address, telephone number (including mobile phone number), street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages you send to users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume, including but not limited to application materials and answers to screener questions submitted to Indeed or to Employers through Indeed and answers you give to any questionnaires sent to you.\nThis information may be associated with your profile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may provide your specific location data when you provide it yourself on the Indeed Apps (as defined in the Indeed Terms of Service Introduction) to help you find more relevant Job Listings.\nIndeed seeks your consent at the time of such provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you create an Indeed account, Indeed may also create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to an account number.\nWe may collect the name you have associated with your device, device type, telephone number, country, and any other information you choose to provide, such as user name, email address, or zip code.\nFor example, while using a mobile device to access Indeed, Indeed may provide a Job Seeker with relevant Job Listings that are located within the same zip code as where this activity is taking place.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Through Your Activity on the Sites</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition, as part of the standard operation of the Sites, Indeed may collect and analyze information from your computer or mobile device and actions taken on the Sites, including, but not limited to, your resume, your searches, the titles of jobs you search, click on or apply to, where those jobs are located, your salary interest or experience, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (where indicated), the Job Listings you apply to, the date, time and type of your activity on the Sites such as how often you update your resume or look for jobs, session activity, browser type, operating system, type of device, mobile device advertising identifier, MAC address, IP address, and any of your other behavior on the Sites.</p>\n<p>For Employers, this may also include actions taken with regard to a Job Listing or to Job Seeker\u2019s resume or application, such as pausing or closing a Job Listing, opening, viewing or responding to a resume or application, or making a decision with regard to a resume, application or Job Listing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Through Your Activity on Indeed Hire</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Employers may be contacted to take advantage of our Indeed Hire service, in which case you may provide Indeed with additional information about hiring needs.\nThis allows Indeed to determine whether or not our Hire product is suitable for an Employer\u2019s needs.\nWhen Job Seekers apply for a job recommended to them by Indeed Hire, Indeed facilitates certain aspects of the recruitment process including, for example, negotiations between the Job Seeker and the Employer, as applicable.\nAs such, we collect and process any information submitted to Indeed through this process, including but not limited to any queries a Job Seeker may have about the job or interview, information about progression through the recruitment process and information relating to salary.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 When Using Automated Phone Screening</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you use any automated phone screening product, Indeed will record and store your answers to an Employer\u2019s screening questions and will forward your answers to the Employer.\nWhere you wish to use such a product, you will agree in advance to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 When Providing Employer Information</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you are an Employer, we may request that you provide certain information in order to verify your account.\nThis information may include, but may not be limited to, your Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), Business Registration information, or a utility bill, the name and email address of an Employer representative.\nThis information will be used for internal purposes only, subject to any request by law enforcement or a court order.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013</em>\n<em>When Using Chargeable Services</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In connection with chargeable services, we will also collect payment information (e.g., the last four digits of credit, debit, or other payment card numbers and related verification information).\nPlease note that Indeed only has access to the last four digits of credit, debit, or other payment card numbers, and does not store full card numbers or related card security codes.</p>\n<strong>2.2 Information Collected When You Apply for Jobs or Access Indeed from Some Third-Party Websites</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 When You Log In or Use Indeed from Some Third-Party Sites</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may also create an account or log in to your Indeed account using third-party websites including, but not limited to, Facebook or Google.\nIf you do not already have an Indeed account but log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, this creates an Indeed account using the same email address used in your Facebook or Google account.\nIf you agree to provide this information to Indeed, Facebook or Google will authenticate you and redirect you to Indeed.\nPlease note, when you log in to Indeed using your Facebook or Google account, Facebook or Google will cookie you in order to authenticate you as a Facebook or Google user.</p>\n<p>By accessing Indeed through your Facebook or Google account, you understand that Facebook or Google will share certain data detailed in the above paragraph for the purposes of authentication to permit you to access Indeed in a secure manner.\nYou may stop this at any point from your Facebook or Google account.\nThis information will be considered Indeed account information for purposes of your use of Indeed.</p>\n<p>You have the ability to disable the connection between your Facebook or Google account and your Indeed account at any time by accessing your privacy settings on your Facebook or Google account.\nFacebook or Google may also ask for your permission to share certain other details with Indeed, including but not limited to your name, profile picture, public profile information, and email address.\nOnce you give this permission, the requested information will be shared with Indeed.\nThis information will be used to provide services to you, including populating your Indeed profile on Indeed.\nThe shared information will remain associated with your Indeed profile until you modify or delete it.</p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH FACEBOOK OR GOOGLE OR ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY WEBSITE.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Indeed for Chrome and Our Mobile Software</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Indeed may also collect information about third-party websites you visit through our mobile software or while using Indeed for Chrome.\nThis could include information about Job Listings, notes or application statuses that you submit, save, or update, or data regarding how you engage with websites or other actions you take on such websites, including URLs of websites you visit.\nWe may also suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in applications you submit on third-party sites and see whether you make changes to these suggestions but not the changes themselves.\nWe do this in order to allow a Job Seeker to keep a record of particular Job Listings of interest, to detect a job application on a third-party site to give a Job Seeker the option to auto-fill parts of the form using Indeed Resume, or to confirm an application.\nIndeed for Chrome also allows Indeed to learn about what types of jobs and Indeed product features are of interest to you, so that we can provide you with improved Job Listing searches, Job Listing recommendations and product features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 When You Apply to Jobs on Some Third-Party Websites</em>\n</strong>\n</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you apply for a job on certain third-party Websites, Indeed may also receive information about the status of your job application and the decisions taken by the Employer such as whether the application reached the interview stage and whether a job offer was accepted or rejected.\nThis information helps Indeed further understand the effectiveness of our Sites and its features.\nIndeed\u2019s use of this information is detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\n<strong>\n<em>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Indeed IQ</em>\n</strong>\n</em>\n</strong>\n</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Indeed provides a programmatic campaign optimizer tool which helps Employers manage, track and optimize the performance of their advertising across a multitude of job advertising sites and platforms in real-time (\u201cIndeed IQ\u201d).\nWhen you click on a Job Listing powered by Indeed IQ, and when you start and complete a job application generated by Indeed IQ on an Employer\u2019s website or a website operated by an Employer\u2019s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information about you and any actions taken by you during your visit using automated means, such as cookies and web beacons.\nThe information collected includes, for example, information about your device, Job Listings viewed/clicked, job applications started and completed, referring URLs and dates and times of site visits.&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>2.3 Any Other Personal Data Indeed May Receive from Third Parties</strong>\n<p>Any Personal Data that Indeed may obtain from other third-party sources, including data from sponsored advertisements that we have on third party sites, will be processed by Indeed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws.</p>\n<strong>2.4 Storage of Your Information</strong>\n<p>Indeed stores your Personal Data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services or until you ask us to delete your Personal Data.\nAs one example, if an Employer deletes a job application in their candidate dashboard on Indeed, Indeed may delete information associated with that application.\nAs another example, after an application has been delivered to an Employer, Indeed may retain a copy of that application for a limited time and then delete the copy.\nWe are also required to retain certain information in order to comply with local laws.</p>\n<p>Indeed may also store the information detailed in this section 2 of the Privacy Policy on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that Indeed has a relationship with.\nSuch storage services will be governed by appropriate protections, as required by applicable rules.</p>\n<strong>2.5 What Personal Data is Required</strong>\n<p>It will be indicated to you at the point of provision as to whether or not particular Personal Data provided by you is required in order to provide particular Indeed services or features to you.\nWhere Personal Data that is required is not provided by you then the particular feature or service may not be available to you.</p>\n<strong>2.6 The Legal Basis on Which Indeed Collects Your Personal Data</strong>\n<p>Indeed collects and processes your Personal Data on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the Personal Data being provided and the type of processing involved.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Performance of a Contract</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Some of the Personal Data processed by Indeed is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you, or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.\nAn example of this would be where Indeed sends a Job Seeker\u2019s application to an Employer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Legitimate Interest</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A second ground relied upon by Indeed for other types of processing of your Personal Data is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Indeed or an Employer.\nExamples of such legitimate interests will include where Indeed sends you marketing about our products and services, where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf, where such processing is strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention, or where we share your Personal Data with Indeed affiliates as detailed in section 4.14 below.\nIndeed will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Compliance with a Legal Obligation</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Indeed to comply with a legal obligation.\nAn example of this would be where Indeed is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time in order to comply with local legal requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Consent</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Indeed relies on your consent in order to process your Personal Data.\nWhere Indeed requires your consent, we seek it at the time of provision, and the processing will only be performed where consent is secured.\nFor example, your consent will be sought in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message such as a Job Alert with Indeed (detailed in section 4 of this Privacy Policy).\nYou can withdraw your consent, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy where applicable, or by sending an email to privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces when sending email).</p>\n<strong> 3.\nLimitations of Use&nbsp;</strong>\n<strong>3.1 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Close a Job Seeker Account</strong>\n<p>When a Job Seeker closes an account, the Job Seeker will no longer have access to any of the data we make available under that account, including but not limited to, search history, job search preferences, saved jobs, jobs the Job Seeker has applied to, Job Alerts, resume, and any other data associated with the account.\nIf the Job Seeker uses the same email address to set up a new account, this data from a previous account will not become available to the Job Seeker again.\nPlease also note that closing your Job Seeker account may result in you losing access to some of our products and the ability to utilize the \u201clog in with Indeed\u201d feature found on certain third party sites.</p>\n<p>Indeed reserves the right to keep any materials in a closed account as necessary to preserve and protect its rights to the extent permitted by law (for example, to preserve records of a dispute) or to comply with its obligations under local law (for example, if requested to retain by law enforcement).\nA closed account does not mean that all of the data is expunged from the Indeed systems, although it will not be readily available under the Job Seeker\u2019s original account.\nWhen the Job Seeker presses the close account button on the dashboard, Indeed will begin to process that instruction within 24 hours and will have completed the operation within 40 days.</p>\n<p>If a Job Seeker wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<strong>3.2 Where an Employer Wants to Disable an Employer Account</strong>\n<p>Employers may disable an account at any time by contacting Indeed Customer Support.\nPlease note that Indeed must preserve business records pertaining to that account to comply with its obligations under law.\nAlternatively, if an Employer agent wishes to access or delete their Personal Data held by Indeed, they should follow the steps listed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<strong>3.3 Where a Job Seeker Wants to Delete a Job Application</strong>\n<p>If a Job Seeker wants to delete a job application performed on the Sites, they are advised to contact the prospective Employer directly to request deletion of their application.\nFor job applications which you, the Job Seeker submit through the Sites (including the use of an Indeed Apply button) to an Employer, (with related materials submitted), please note: 1) that your applications and materials may be controlled by an Employer and 2) we may direct you to that Employer for Personal Data deletion requests where that Personal Data is held by that Employer.</p>\n<strong>3.4 Where the Employer Contact Details Provided to Indeed Are Incorrect</strong>\n<p>Indeed depends on the Employer or the Employer\u2019s agent to provide Indeed with the correct destination for all applications.\nIn the event that the electronic destination provided to Indeed is incorrect, your application materials will not be sent to the intended recipient of the application.\nIndeed has no liability for such applications.\nIf you do not wish to send your application materials in this manner, you should send them directly to the Employer.</p>\n<strong>3.5 @Indeedmail Addresses</strong>\n<p>When communicating through Indeed\u2019s message relay system, you will see an email address with an @indeedemail.com or @indeedmail.com ending.\nYou understand that you retain no ownership rights in these email addresses, which are specific to Employers\u2019 Job Listings, but are owned by Indeed.\nHowever, Indeed\u2019s relay system will show the name associated with your account or job application in the \u201cTo:\u201d or \u201cFrom:\u201d field.\nIn addition, the above shall apply to any email

answers to screener questions, to identify you, determine relevant search results and reach out to you about jobs you may be interested in.\nWe may also use profile data to tailor your experience on the Sites and to display content according to your preferences.\nWe may return different results for the same search query and have full discretion with respect to the Job Listings we present in

Your Contact Information</strong>\n<p>When you give the Sites contact information (such as your name and email address) and other forms of Personal and Non-Personal Data, you agree that we may utilize this information for the purposes outlined in sections 4, 5 and 9, to the extent applicable.\nIn particular, you agree that we may, as part of our services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), text message or postal mail.\nThis includes communication through the use of contact information that you may provide to us or that we may otherwise obtain from third-party resources.\nShould you apply to a job that is supported by our Indeed Hire product, a Hiring Specialist may use your contact information to conduct or coordinate interviews with you, and provide you with updates throughout the hiring process.\nWe may also analyze our users\u2019 contact information in the aggregate to better understand our users and improve our products and services.</p>\n<strong>4.4 Your Resume Information</strong>\n<p>Your information, including Personal Data, gets placed on the Sites when you upload or edit a resume, which becomes part of your Job Seeker profile.\nWe reserve the right to charge third parties a fee for accessing your information, including Personal Data, as part of the Sites\u2019 services.\nAt your direction, we may also send your resume to third parties if you choose to apply for a Job Listing.\nWe may also use information in your Job Seeker profile to offer suggestions to you when you apply for jobs on third party websites in our mobile software.\nThe extent to which your information is made available to third parties depends on the privacy settings you choose, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nWhen a Job Seeker creates a profile on Indeed, their resume is set to public by default, and the Job Seeker may change their resume privacy settings at any time.\nThis is detailed below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Private Resumes</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Private resumes are only made available to those to whom the Job Seeker has initiated an application or provided their resume.\nWhere this occurs, you make your resume, your name and other Personal Data that you place on your resume available to third parties.\nThose third parties may be interested in you as an employee, and may forward your resume to other third parties.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Public Resumes</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Public resumes may be available to anyone accessing our Site.&nbsp;This includes users of Indeed\u2019s Resume Search product, Employers whose Company Page you may be following, and anyone with access to the URL associated with your public resume, such as search engines and other third parties that may crawl our Site.&nbsp;We offer you this visibility to help you find a job.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you make your resume public (or upload a file as your resume and set it to public) on our Site, you authorize Indeed to share the contents of your resume, including your name and any other Personal Data that you may include in it, publicly on the Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our Resume Search product allows Employers to find great candidates by searching public resumes.&nbsp;By posting a public resume, you authorize Indeed to make your entire public resume available to any user who searches for you on our Site, and to allow employers to see if you were recently active on the Sites, your readiness to work, and your available contact methods.&nbsp;If you upload a file as your resume and set it to public, you authorize Indeed to extract the contents of this file and share them on our Site, including within our Resume Search product.&nbsp;We may remove your name and contact information from your public resume in certain instances, such as for users of our Resume Search product without a subscription.\nEmployers who have subscribed to our Resume Search product will be able to see your name, but we remove your contact information until you express interest in an Employer.&nbsp;In either case, Employers may still contact you through our Site using our Relay Service.\nYou also authorize Indeed to share any file you upload as your resume and set to public with Employers where you express interest in them.</p>\n<p>Indeed expressly prohibits all scraping of its Site, although some third parties may use our Site in violation of these terms to obtain your public resume information.</p>\n<p>Please note that Resume Search has not launched in all markets.\nIf you are located in a market where Resume Search has not yet launched, setting your resume to public may make it available to anyone who visits the associated URL but it may not be searchable on our Site.\nResumes set to public in markets where Resume Search is not yet available may become searchable upon our launch of Resume Search in that market.</p>\n<p>Indeed may also provide browser extensions and other tools to help Employers better interact with Job Seekers and their resume information, including tools that allow Employers to download your resume information and enhance and transfer it to third parties engaged to process information on their behalf, such as applicant tracking systems and other recruitment management tools.&nbsp.\nEmployers are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws that relate to their use of information obtained from Indeed and other sources, including any obligations Employers may have to restrict how others interact with resume information downloaded from our Site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Changing Your Resume Privacy Settings</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you place your resume on Indeed, it will be set to public by default.\nYou may adjust this at any point by editing your privacy settings on Indeed.\nWhere you adjust your resume from public to private, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may continue to contain your resume information.\nAdditionally, Employers who have saved your resume while it was public may continue to have access to your resume even after you have adjusted it to private.</p>\n<strong>4.5 Matching Job Seekers With Employers</strong>\n<p>You acknowledge that Indeed may determine whether the words of your resume or any other individuals\u2019 resume match the words of certain job descriptions, and vice versa, in order to improve the Sites or any of our other products or services (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant job descriptions and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>\n<p>Indeed may also provide information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy, including Personal Data, to Employers that may be interested in contacting you.\nBy applying to a job, answering screener questions, providing your contact information to show interest in a Job Listing, using Indeed Hire, or by replying to a message from an Employer, such as by expressing your interest in a particular Job Listing, you agree to the disclosure of your information to that Employer.\nIndeed may also provide the results of any Indeed Assessments you complete to Employers, where you agree to such provision at the time of taking such an assessment.\nIndeed may also use information provided to Indeed via your resume to pre-populate application information for you and for similar purposes.</p>\n<p>If you have an account or a hosted resume, you agree that we may contact you or suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your activity on Indeed.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you are located in the United States and you set your resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about you with recruiters working for or on behalf of Employers.\nIf you do not wish to share such information, you may set your resume to private.</p>\n<strong>4.6 Optimizing Job Campaigns</strong>\n<p>When Job Seekers click on a Job Listing or apply for a job powered by Indeed IQ on our Sites or on a third-party website, including an Employer\u2019s website or a website operated by an Employer\u2019s applicant tracking system, Indeed may collect certain information through this feature about Job Seekers and any actions taken while on the Sites, as detailed in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy.\nIndeed uses this information to help us understand the effectiveness of our Sites and to ensure that Job Listings powered by Indeed IQ perform at the optimal level on our Sites and on other third-party websites.</p>\n<strong>4.7 Sending Messages on Indeed</strong>\n<p>Indeed provides two-way message proxy and relay services to the users of our Indeed products (\u201cRelay Service\u201d), including, but not limited to: Indeed Resume, Indeed Apply, Post a Job, Indeed Chat, Indeed Onboarding, Indeed Text2Apply, Indeed Community, private calling, and other electronic communication services whether in the form of phone, text, video or audio.\nBy utilizing any Relay Service, you acknowledge that you are asking Indeed to send these messages on your behalf.\nThis includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials.\nIndeed may provide read receipts to the sender of a message through a Relay Service indicating that the recipient has viewed the message.\nIndeed may also separately inform the sender and recipient of a message through a Relay Service whether the sender or recipient recently has been active on the Site.</p>\n<p>We process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content, which may include Personal Data, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of the Sites\u2019 rules and other Indeed policies, content moderation, and to improve the Sites or any other Indeed product or service.\nExamples of such improvements would be improving the open rate of messages by optimizing their delivery, optimizing our search results, improving Job Listings, permitting applicants to manage their applications after transmitting them to Indeed, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam.\nSome of this activity is performed on Indeed\u2019s behalf by service providers, as described in the section of this Privacy Policy titled \u2018Transfers of Information to Service Providers\u2019.\nAs a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient.\nIndeed may (but is not obligated to) notify you in such an event.\nBy using a Relay Service or otherwise providing User Content through the Site, you agree to this activity and acknowledge that this activity is necessary for maintaining the quality of the Sites and for providing the Relay Service.</p>\n<strong>4.8 Sending You Text Messages About Employer Appointments</strong>\n<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled an interview or event with you, when an Employer seeks to contact you based on your public resume, or has responded to your application via Indeed\u2019s email relay.\nIn such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form.\nBy entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept text messages at the number.\nIndeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interviews or messages through Indeed\u2019s email relay, and you agree to accept such text messages on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.\nTo unsubscribe at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact Indeed Customer Support.\nReplying STOP in response to an Indeed SMS alert will unsubscribe you from all Indeed SMS alerts except those related to Text2Apply and Hiring Events.\nIn order to unsubscribe from those products, you must respond STOP within the specific text flows of those products.</p>\n<strong>4.9 Facilitating telephone relay system between Job Seekers and Employers</strong>\n<p>Where applicable, Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the option to use a telephone relay system to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications, conducting job interviews or other communication related to a Job Listing.\nSuch a system uses masked or proxy telephone numbers to protect users, and is only available to users who select it on the Site.\nNo recording of conversations or messages is performed through this relay system, although data relating to whether a call was answered and call duration may be gathered.\nSuch functionality is provided to Indeed by third party service providers, such as Twilio.</p>\n<strong>4.10 Facilitating text messaging relay service between Job Seekers and Employers</strong>\n<p>Indeed may offer Job Seekers and Employers the ability to utilize an autodialed text messaging relay service to facilitate contact for the purpose of submitting applications and for other communications related to Job Listings.\nTo use this service, a Job Seeker must text an Employer\u2019s preset keyword to a telephone number or short code that we make available on our Sites or in advertising materials (such as a sign or flyer at an Employer\u2019s place of business).\nBy texting the preset keyword to the telephone number or short code, you are consenting to receive text messages about the Employer\u2019s Job Listings and as part of the application process, and acknowledge Indeed may use your Personal Data to submit your application to the Employer and otherwise in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nTo unsubscribe at any time from such services, reply STOP by text message to the telephone number or short code provided or contact Indeed Customer Support.\nDUE TO THE UNSTRUCTURED CONVERSATIONAL FORMAT OF THIS SERVICE, WE MAY NOT RECOGNIZE OTHER UNSUBSCRIBE ATTEMPTS.</p>\n<strong>4.11 Preventing Fraud and Spam</strong>\n<p>Indeed may also use information collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy to help diagnose problems with the Sites and our products and services, to prevent potentially fraudulent or illegal activities, and to protect individuals from other activities that may be detrimental to you or others.\nIndeed may investigate and disclose information from or about you or your use of Indeed if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (including subpoenas, search warrants, court orders) and law enforcement instructions and orders.\n(b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the use of the Sites.\nor (c) may protect our rights, reputation, property, safety, or that of the public.\nor (d) as necessary to meet national security requirements.</p>\n<p>For example, Indeed is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, the Data Protection Commission of Ireland, and many other regulatory bodies.</p>\n<p>We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud.\nHowever, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur.\nThese efforts may, on occasion, result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Preventing Fraud and Spam in Messages</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Indeed also reserves the right to drop messages from our relay system that we determine do not adhere to the Sites\u2019 rules or any of the terms of our terms of service.\nIndeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming Indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on the Sites by various means.\nIndeed also reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third parties if we have a good faith belief that you are using the Sites in violation of this Privacy Policy or the applicable terms of service.</p>\n<p>Indeed reserves the right to verify and confirm the identity of any party associated with an email relay.\nThis includes but is not limited to verifying the identity of the sender of an email with the Employer agents associated with that email address on the relevant Job Listing.</p>\n<strong>4.12 Facilitating Payment</strong>\n<p>If you provide credit, debit or other payment card and related details to us in order to make a payment, we will use such information only for the purpose of processing the payment (e.g., the last four digits of credit card numbers and related verification information).\nAny credit, debit, or other payment card and related billing and payment information that you provide to us may be shared by us with companies who work on our behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment and servicing your account.</p>\n<strong>4.13 Automated Processing of Your Personal Data</strong>\n<p>In order to optimize the performance of the Sites, we perform automated processing of Personal Data evaluating certain specific aspects relating to a user.\nIn particular we use automated processing to analyze or predict a user\u2019s personal preferences or interests.\nWhere it occurs, such processing is carried out if it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with our users, to allow us to provide our services to Job Seekers and Employers, including analyzing applications and resumes on behalf of Employers, or in other cases on the basis of a user\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p>For example, in certain cases such processing allows us to match Job Seekers with Employers effectively, to provide Job Seekers with Job Alerts, recommended jobs, and Invitations to Apply to jobs that the Job Seeker is likely to be more interested in, to send particular Job Seeker applications to an Employer, to display search results, or to perform certain spam and fraud detection activities to protect our users.\nSuch processing is subject to the safeguards detailed in this Privacy Policy to protect the privacy of our users.\nYou may contact privacy-dept @ indeed.com (remove spaces) to contest any decision generated by said automated processing.</p>\n<strong>4.14 Sharing your Information with Our Affiliates </strong>\n<p>Our core mission is to help Job Seekers find great jobs, and Employers find great candidates, which is a mission we share with each of our affiliates.\nIn order to support that mission, we share certain information with our affiliates.\nSuch information sharing is governed by this Privacy Policy.\nWe also developed the Privacy Center as a way of educating our users about our affiliates and how we share data with them to provide the strongest product and service offerings to our users.\nWe encourage you to visit the Privacy Center to learn more.</p>\n<p>Information shared by you with Indeed may be shared with an affiliated entity to provide you with services, to improve the Sites and optimize functionality on the Sites, and other purposes as described in this Policy.\nIn particular, such sharing strengthens our ability to help Job Seekers find jobs and Employers find great candidates.\nThe services provided to you and the functionality of the Sites could not be provided without such transfers.\nIf you do not wish your information to be transferred in this way you should not use the Sites.</p>\n<p>Examples of our affiliates include: Glassdoor, SimplyHired, Indeed Flex/Syft, Resume.com, RescueMyResumes.com and Resumeperfector.com.&nbsp;Such data sharing with Indeed affiliates will be performed for a number of specific reasons and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Policies of those affiliates.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Improved Services</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Data sharing with affiliates provides Job Seekers with more personalized and improved content, performance, features and services.\nFor example, Indeed and its affiliates use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.\nthe jobs you click on), IP address, or your resume or profile information, to determine relevant search results, Job Alerts, display and moderate career insights, such as company reviews, Job Listing salary data, interview tips and more.\nSuch sharing is also performed to facilitate improved data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement.</p>\n<p>This sharing also allows Employers to have better insight into the performance of their Job Listings.\nFor example, we may share data related to user clicks on their Job Listings which in turn allows Employers to understand the extent to which they are attracting candidates.\nBy providing Employers with the information they need to better utilize our platform, they can provide stronger Job Listings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 More Employers, More Job Listings and More Job Seekers</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Such data sharing allows Job Seekers to access an even broader database of Job Listings and Employers, and for Employers to access more Job Seekers.\nFor example, this allows Indeed to recommend jobs or Employers on our Sites or on websites of our affiliates.\nIt also facilitates applications and the display of Job Listings from the Sites to affiliates\u2019 websites and vice versa.</p>\n<p>For example, Indeed and its affiliates recommend a Job Seeker to an Employer, and a Job Listing to a Job Seeker.\nThis applies to Job Seekers, Employers and Job Listings on Indeed and any of its affiliates.\nIndeed and its affiliates also share Employer data (such as account information and behavioral data) to provide a better experience to those Employers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Better Security for Users</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Such data sharing allows Indeed and our affiliates to process your Personal Data for the purpose of improving user security and internal operations, troubleshooting, and detecting and preventing fraud and spam.</p>\n<strong>4.15 Transfers of Information to Employers&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>Indeed sends Job Seeker Personal Data to Employers on the instruction of Job Seekers.\nSuch transfers are performed in the course of the job search, application and interview process.\nThis is further described in sections 2 and 4 of this Privacy Policy.\nSuch Personal Data will be processed in accordance with these terms and those of the relevant Employer.\nJob Seekers that apply to jobs through Indeed that are outside their own country may involve sending their Personal Data to countries with lower levels of data protection.</p>\n<p>Employer account holders agree to comply with all their responsibilities under applicable data protection rules with respect to the collection, processing and storage of Personal Data, as well as providing adequate protection of all data subject rights provided for under all applicable data protection rules.</p>\n<strong>4.16 Transfers of Information to Job Seekers</strong>\n<p>Indeed sends certain Employer-related information to Job Seekers.\nThis includes publishing Job Ads, Company Pages, and salary information on the Sites and publishing Job Listings on third-party websites.\nIndeed may also provide information to Job Seekers about an Employer\u2019s activity and responsiveness on the Sites in order to help Job Seekers evaluate employment opportunities.\nThis may include the Employer representative\u2019s name, the Employer\u2019s city/state location, whether the Employer has taken an action with regard to the Job Seeker\u2019s resume or application such as opening, viewing, responding to or making a decision in regard to it, whether the Employer has engaged with other Job Seekers or viewed other Job Seekers\u2019 resumes, and whether the Employer has taken an action in regard to a Job Listing such as pausing or closing it.\nAs an Employer, when you use the Sites (for example by posting a Job Listing or contacting a Job Seeker through the Indeed Resume Program) you agree that Indeed may provide this information to Job Seekers.</p>\n<strong>4.17 Transfers of Information to Service Providers&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>We may use third parties to perform services in connection with our operations, to improve the Sites and our services, products, and features, to protect our users and better understand their needs, and to optimize the services and the users\u2019 experiences.\nThese service providers may have access to Personal Data in the course of providing these services, which may involve transfers of such Personal Data to other countries.\nSuch transfers are made for the purposes set forth in sections 4, 5 and 9 of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\u2013&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Improving our Services</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These third parties may provide data points including how much time you spend on specific pages, which links you choose to click, and data that helps determine user preferences.\nThis information enables us to build and maintain our services with user feedback.\nThese third parties may use cookies and other technologies to collect data on your behavior and devices such as the device type, browser information, and preferred language.\nAn example of one of these third parties is Hotjar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\u2013&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Maintaining Quality and Protecting Users</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Indeed may transfer your Personal Data in limited situations to certain third-party vendors that assist Indeed with protecting our users and maintaining the quality of our services, products and features provided to those users.\nAn example would be vendors Indeed uses for fraud detection purposes.\nExamples of those vendors include: SiftScience, Emailage, and PerimeterX.\nAnother example would be vendors Indeed uses to prevent accounts being created using account credentials that have been publicly disclosed.\nAn example of such a vendor is: SpyCloud.</p>\n<p>\u2013&nbsp;<strong>\n<em>Facilitating Payments</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Indeed may also share any credit, debit, or other payment card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed with companies who work on Indeed\u2019s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Installing or Using an Indeed App</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to provide you with certain services and support ad attribution, limited user data may be shared with certain service providers when you install, download or use an Indeed App.\nThis may include your IP address or other unique identifier, and event data related to the installation of the Indeed App.</p>\n<p>This may be done for a variety of purposes, including facilitating user log-in through third party accounts.\nIt may also assist us to understand and optimize our users\u2019 complete customer journey by helping us: (i) understand how users arrive to the Sites.\n(ii) better measure the performance of our ads.\nand (iii) understand where a user has accessed the Sites through different devices.</p>\n<p>When you download or install an Indeed App, you acknowledge and accept that your Personal Data may be transferred to these service providers.\nYou also agree to Indeed\u2019s Cookie Policy, Privacy Policy and the applicable terms of service, and are informed that you may avail of your rights at any time, as detailed in section 10 of this Privacy Policy, including the right to object to the legitimate interest use of your Personal Data for marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Examples of the types of technologies that may support this behavior include pixels, javascript snippets, or cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>\u2013 Storage</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please also be aware that we may also use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to standard terms and conditions that may be non-negotiable.\nThese service providers have informed us or the general public that they apply security measures they consider adequate for the protection of information within their system, or they have a general reputation for applying such measures.\nHowever, we will not be liable (to the fullest extent permitted by law) for any damages that may result from the misuse of any information, including Personal Data, by these companies.</p>\n<strong>4.18&nbsp;Transfers of Publicly Available Information</strong>\n<p>When users post content on the Sites in a manner that is intended to make that content publicly available and searchable by individuals, Indeed reserves the right to aggregate and share that information with third parties.\nFor example, if an Employer posts a job on the Sites, Indeed may share that Job Listing or information contained within that Job Listing with third parties, at Indeed\u2019s discretion and subject to agreement with such third parties.\nIndeed also reserves the right to share information aggregated from public sources in this capacity.</p>\n<strong>4.19 Third-Party Sites You Link to from Indeed</strong>\n<p>You may also use certain third-party websites or services that you link to from the Sites.\nIn such cases, all information you provide to a third party is provided to that third party and not to Indeed, and is subject to the third-party\u2019s privacy policy and terms of service.\nPlease see section 8 of this Privacy Policy titled Links to Third-Party Websites for more information.</p>\n<strong>4.20 Transfers of Personal Data for individuals in the EU (including the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d)) and Switzerland</strong>\n<p>Please see section 11 of this Privacy Policy for information related to this.</p>\n<strong> 5.\nAdditional Uses and Disclosures of Non-Personal Data</strong>\n<p>This policy also applies to our use of Non-Personal Data.\nWe may use and disclose Non-Personal Data for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.\nIf we combine any Non-Personal Data with Personal Data, then we will only use and disclose such combined information for the purposes described in sections 4 and 9 of this Privacy Policy while it is so combined.</p>\n<strong> 6.\nSecurity</strong>\n<p>Indeed seeks to use reasonable security measures to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Data under Indeed\u2019s control.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.\nIn addition, please note that emails, messages sent

Updated:<b>\n</b> December 14, 2020 </b>\n</p> &nbsp.\n<p>&nbsp;</p> &nbsp.\nA.\nTerms of Service for Job Seekers &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n1.\nJob Ads or Job Listings <p>Indeed, which is free to those individuals searching for employment openings (\u201cJob Seekers\u201d), may make available Job Ads advertising employment opportunities and other job-related content, including links to third-party websites (\u201cJob Listings\u201d or \u201cJob Ads\u201d), through Indeed\u2019s search results or otherwise through the Site.\nSearching for Job Ads on Indeed is free for Job Seekers.\nJob Ads are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control.\nyou acknowledge and understand that Indeed has no control over the content of Job Ads, links to or from Job Ads, or any conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker has submitted an application or left the Site.\nFor example, some of these third parties may attempt to charge Job Seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, although Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site.\nIf you leave the Indeed Site and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party.\nEmployer websites may have conversion trackers or other functionality provided by Indeed, which informs us that an application has been completed on an Employer site.\nAn Employer who installs such functionality is required under this Agreement to provide any notice, and obtain any prior consent, that may be required by applicable law.\nHowever, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no control over such an Employer or its website.\nYou agree to Indeed\u2019s use of, and receipt of information from, any such conversion tracker functionality.\nExcept for sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job Ads contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner.\nIndeed has no obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job Ads in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job Ads from the Site for any or no reason.\nWe cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of any Job Ad or other information submitted by any Employer or other user, including the identity of such Employer or other user.\nIndeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job Ads, Company Pages, screener questions and responses, and assessments.\nAdditionally, Indeed may provide search options to narrow down Job Ads search results by job type categories (i.e.\nfull-time, part-time, etc.), and such categories are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and may not directly or accurately reflect the content of the Job Ads.\nIndeed may reformat Job Listings so that you may read them more clearly on a mobile phone.\nWhile Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads, helping keep Indeed job search free for Job Seekers, all Job Ads are considered advertising.\nIndeed displays Job Ads based on a combination of employer bids and relevance, such as search terms, and other information provided and activities conducted on Indeed.\nYou are not permitted to use Indeed\u2019s Site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes.\nFor purposes of this Section A of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as a Job Seeker.\nIndeed may provide functionality to call a telephone number contained in a Job Ad using the phone app on a mobile device.\nIndeed cannot guarantee that the extracted phone number is the correct phone number for the Employer or for the Job Ad you are viewing.</p> 2.\nResumes and Recommended Jobs <p>By creating a public resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your resume to third parties, such as Employers, that Indeed believes may have an interest in your resume.\nBy creating or uploading a resume on Indeed (an \u201cIndeed Resume\u201d), Indeed may share with you Job Listings that match the contents of your Indeed Resume.\nIndeed assumes no responsibility and disclaims all liability for the resume or application information you post, send or receive through the Site.\nIf you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so.\nTo protect your privacy, Indeed may mask or hide your contact information, such as your email address, from your resume or application, for example, and may substitute it with an alias.</p>\n<p>Indeed may also automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Indeed account or apply to a job.\nIndeed may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself (including in your Indeed Resume), searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Indeed.</p> 3.\nApplying to Jobs Through Indeed <p>Any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume, application or responses to screener questions and assessments (\u201cIndeed Apply\u201d), is subject to this Agreement (including Section D.3.) and to Indeed\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nOnce you provide information to an Employer (whether in the form of a job application, resume, email, or otherwise), Indeed does not have control over the Employer\u2019s use or disclosure of that information.\nIf you want to request the Employer delete, modify, or maintain confidence over any such information, you must make such a request directly to the Employer.\n(All references on the Site to \u201cApply Now\u201d, \u201cEasily Apply\u201d, \u201cSimple Apply\u201d, \u201cApply from your phone\u201d, \u201cApply with Indeed\u201d, \u201cRSVP to hiring event\u201d or any similar references mean \u201cIndeed Apply.\u201d) Indeed may use your application materials to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing.\nIndeed may store such information regardless of whether a Job Listing has been closed or is no longer available on the Site.\nTo maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on your ability to apply to Job Listings or to other Indeed services.\nIn addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply or by RSVPing to a hiring event you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s).\nWhen you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed\u2019s relay system, or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that in doing so, Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf.\nWhen you apply for a job on Indeed you agree to Indeed\u2019s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, as such processing is an essential part of this Agreement.\nAdditionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>When you apply to a job using Indeed Apply, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent.\nWe cannot guarantee that such messages and applications will be delivered, received, accessed, read or acted upon.\nIndeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or other application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.\nHowever, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.\nPlease note that Job Ads may expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is received.\nIndeed has no responsibility for expired Job Ads or for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad\u2019s expiration.&nbsp;In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us by Employers.\nWe also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs).\nIf you do not feel comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having your application or messages stored on Indeed, do not use the Indeed Apply or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including the public mail system.\nYou may contact the Employer directly to find alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through Indeed.\nBy using the Indeed Apply system, you fully consent to the above.</p>\n<p>If you require alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.</p>\n<p>By using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer\u2019s job application, messages, screener questions, skills assessments or their format or method of delivery, and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer.\nPlease note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers.\nSome questions may be labeled as Optional, indicating only that the application may be submitted to the Employer without providing an answer.\nIndeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will consider such an application or make a particular determination with regard to such an application.\nIndeed may inform Job Seekers that an Employer\u2019s requirement from a job description does not appear to be present on a resume or application.\nthis information is presented without warranty and Indeed does not guarantee that updating a resume or application will result in any job offer.\nIndeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs.\nIndeed cannot make any guarantee&nbsp;regarding health and safety measures in an Employer\u2019s hiring or interviewing process.\nIndeed recommends Job Seekers follow personal health and safety best practices as recommended by the World Health Organization&nbsp;or similar institution.&nbsp;<strong>Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations.\nJob Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Indeed may use your application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker\u2019s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.\nYou agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches.\nIndeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).\nBy using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if your answers do not match the answers sought by the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.\nIndeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.\nActivating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer\u2019s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application.\nThese notices are automatically sent after a period of time selected by the Employer, unless the Employer indicates to Indeed their interest in your application.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer\u2019s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application on Indeed within the time period selected by the Employer.\nAny interactions the Employer has directly with you and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing you directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and would not by themselves prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.</p>\n<p>When you search for jobs on the Indeed Job Search app and proceed to apply for a job, including jobs on third party sites, Indeed may suggest information from your Indeed profile to include in your application.\nIt is your responsibility to review suggestions before accepting them and including them on your application.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For job seekers located in the UK, you acknowledge that when contacted by Indeed, presented as Indeed Hire (hereinafter referred to as \u201cIndeed Hire\u201d), Indeed is acting as an Employment Agency (as defined under applicable law).\nThe services Indeed Hire offers are set out in these terms.\nIndeed Hire will only send you Job Listings that Indeed Hire determines may be of interest to you.\nYou further acknowledge that Indeed Hire is not authorised to receive any money on your behalf and/or to enter into any contracts on your behalf.\nYou may also end your relationship with Indeed Hire at any time.</p> 4.\nCommunications and Other Actions on the Site <p>When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, messages, applications, questions and responses in applications, and any other information) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.\nWhen an Employer views, sends, stores or receives materials through or using the Site, Indeed may inform you about such actions.\nAdditionally, we may also inform you that an Employer has taken other actions with regards to a Job Ad, your Resume, or your application, such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening your Resume or application, viewing your Resume or application, responding to your Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to your application or Job Ad.\nIndeed may inform the Employer about activities you take on the Site or your use of the Site, for example, whether you are online on Indeed, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.</p>\n<p>If you have turned on browser push notification and wish to turn them off, you may do so by visiting the settings on your browser.</p>\n<p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when an Employer has scheduled interviews with you.\nIn such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your phone number and that you have the right to accept text messages at the number.\nIndeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interview and you agree to accept such text message reminder on your cell phone, including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.\nPlease note that since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers.\nWe also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive such text messages.</p>\n<p>Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties.\nPlease note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy and that such calls are not placed through or tracked by Indeed.\nYour standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply.</p>\n<p>You may receive messages, including but not limited to text messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or an Employer\u2019s (in the event you applied for a job) activity on or use of the Site, Indeed Apply, Indeed Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site.\nIn all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a courtesy, and you should not rely on them.\nFor example, if you accept an interview request, it is your responsibility to follow up with the employer separately to ensure they know your response, do not rely on notifications through Indeed.\nIndeed may use your email address to create an alias email address for your communication, in lieu of displaying your actual email address to the Employer.\nShould you choose to send an email from a third party email client, the person with whom you\u2019re communicating may be able to see your email address, rather than the alias.\nIndeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such courtesy notices, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.\nIn the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.</p>\n<p>Indeed may enable chatbots, which allows you to take certain actions on the Site, such as apply to a job, schedule an interview, or otherwise interact with the Site, Employers, or Job Listings on our Site (\u201cChatbot\u201d).\nYou understand that the Chatbot is an automated service that does not involve human interaction.\nIt is your responsibility to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information submitted through the Chatbot.\nIndeed is not responsible for any loss, damage or inconvenience arising as a consequence of the use (or inability to use) the Chatbot or from the information you submit via the Chatbot.</p>\n<p>Indeed reserves the right to turn on or enable Indeed Chat or other communication options for select Employers or Job Listings, in its sole discretion, and to notify you that Indeed Chat or other communication options are available for a particular job or Employer.\nFor Indeed Chat, you may access or view your messages by visiting your Indeed Chat messages dashboard.\nIndeed may, in its sole discretion, turn off or disable Indeed Chat for any Employer or Job Seeker at any time without prior notice.\nPlease note that if you are using Indeed Chat to communicate with an Employer, Indeed will deliver your messages as instructed by the Employer.</p> 5.\nVirtual Communications <p>Employers may offer you the opportunity to participate in virtual and remote communications using Indeed products, including but not limited to, phone interviews, virtual meetings, and video interviews (\u201cVirtual Interviews\u201d).\nYou understand that Indeed is not a telecommunications service provider and that Indeed is only providing the option for you to communicate with Employers via services that may be offered by third-party providers.\nPlease note that since these telecommunication services may depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays or malfunctions on the part of those providers.\nWe cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive, transmit, or support such phone or video communications.\nIndeed does not guarantee any aspect of your Virtual Interview experience including transmission of phone or video communications, quality of audio/visual content, data security, or data usage and restrictions.\n<strong>Indeed is not liable for any claims arising out of your use of Virtual Interviews and you release Indeed from any such claims.</strong>\n<br> You understand that Indeed does not guarantee the Employer\u2019s schedule or availability for conducting Virtual Interviews and cannot vouch for the validity of the contact information provided to us.\nYou also understand that the Employer is responsible for any and all questions, comments, or hiring decisions made.\nFurther, Employers are responsible for any accommodations you need during Virtual Interviews.</p>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THERE IS NO PROTECTION FOR ANY INFORMATION YOU SHARE OR DATA THAT YOU TRANSMIT WHILE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUDIO/VISUAL CONTENT, INTERVIEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, OR YOUR IMAGE OR LIKENESS.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT INDEED IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING OR PROTECTING ANY DATA OR INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT DURING YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.\nINDEED ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR THE MISUSE OF ANY DATA YOU SHARE OR TRANSMIT THROUGH USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.</p>\n<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT INDEED DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF VIRTUAL INTERVIEWS.</p> 6.\nIndeed Assessments <p>Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers (\u201cAssessments\u201d) and responses from Job Seekers (\u201cResponses\u201d) through the Site.\nEmployers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses.\nAfter you provide a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.\nIf there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Job Seeker will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</p>\n<p>An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill.\nIt does not evaluate a Job Seeker\u2019s qualification for any job.\nWhether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Job Seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment and reviewing your Response.\nReceiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer.\nAn Employer is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified Job Seeker.\nEmployers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.\nThe Employer is the sole party to determine whether to consider any retaken Assessments as part of their hiring process.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and understand that Employers select which Assessments to associate with their job openings, and that Indeed does not choose the Assessments sent by Employers and has no control over Employers\u2019 selection or use of Assessments.\nYou agree that the questions in any Assessment are solely being asked by the Employer sending the Assessment and are not being asked by Indeed.\n<b>You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law, and that the responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with Employers</b>.\nIf you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the Employer.\nIndeed may provide a means by which you may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from the Employer.\nIndeed does not guarantee the Employer\u2019s receipt of, or response to, any such request.\nWhile Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</p>\n<p>You agree and acknowledge that the usefulness and value of Assessments and Responses depend on their contents being kept confidential.\nYou therefore agree to keep the content of Assessments and Responses confidential and to not reproduce or discuss them with anyone, except that you may communicate with an Employer about an Assessment they have sent to you and your Response.</p>\n<p>Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Assessment or Response, or to include any Assessment or Response in the Site, and may exclude or remove any Assessment or Response from the Site for any or no reason without liability or notice.\nAssessment links sent to you may continue to be active after an Employer has paused or closed their job campaign on Indeed.\nOnce an Employer pauses or closes their Job Ad (for example, after the Employer has made a hire), Indeed cannot guarantee that the Employer will view any related notices or updates, including Assessments, Responses, and accommodation requests.\nYou may still choose to take the Assessment for the purpose of adding its results to your Indeed Profile or for another job application.</p>\n<p>Indeed may also offer you the option to select an Assessment to complete independent of a particular job, and your Response will be associated with your Indeed Profile.\nYou may choose whether the Response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed Profile, though Indeed will count the Response for purposes of generating aggregate Response statistics even if Your Response is hidden.</p>\n<p>As a Job Seeker, you consent to your Responses, applications, and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nYou are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make your Response available to the Employer providing the Assessment, or (in the case of Assessments selected by you) to any Employer viewing Your Indeed Profile.\nYou understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to display or reformat Responses in a manner to permit Employers to review your Response together with Responses from other Job Seekers.\nIndeed may aggregate the results of all Job Seeker-selected Assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile for Your Response.\nYou also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Response to an Employer, that request cannot be canceled.\nIndeed does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any Response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.\nHowever, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>\n<p>As a Job Seeker, you shall not create or send any Response which: (i) contains any highly confidential personal information, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of data subject to special breach notification requirements in any country.\n(ii) contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing).\nor (iii) directly or indirectly violates the Site Rules.</p>\n<p>Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.\nBy using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers.\nIndeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.\nThe sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.</p>\n<p>As a Job Seeker, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the Employer.</p>\n<p>Indeed is not a third party beneficiary of or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Job Seeker, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.\nIndeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>\n<p>Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</p> 7.\nSalary, Career, Hiring and Other Information Provided by Indeed <p>Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only.\nFor example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, or number of applies to a Job Listing,&nbsp;or the likelihood that a particular event will occur such as being selected for an interview.&nbsp;This information&nbsp;provided by Indeed is based on estimates given for informational purposes only and without warranty, and is subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.\nIndeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.\nPlease note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates.\nThese figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.\nMinimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.</p>\n<p>Similarly, career-related or hiring-related information provided by Indeed is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling or staffing services.\nYou understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search.\nYou further understand that in providing any such career or hiring guides, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm.\nYou also understand that by referring to or using such career or hiring guides, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, or assurance of being hired, and you take full responsibility for use of these services or guides.\nAs a user of the Site, Indeed may, from time to time, send you emails from the career or hiring guides as part of its services to you.\nThese emails may include but not be limited to, tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, and how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired.</p>\n<p>Indeed may offer, as part of the Services, the opportunity for you to engage with third parties, sometimes referred to as career coaches&nbsp;or professional writers, to discuss job search,&nbsp;resume writing, or&nbsp;career strategies, either through the Site or in person.\nRegardless of how you interact with them, you acknowledge that these third parties are not employees of Indeed and that Indeed is not responsible for the content of any such discussion.\nDo not share any information you consider confidential or personally sensitive with these third parties.\nIndeed does not guarantee the quality or effectiveness of any advice, recommendations, or guidance you may receive from these third parties.\nYou agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, Indeed will have no liability arising from any discussion you have with such a third party.</p> 8.\nYour Job Seeker Data <p>As a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site.\nFor example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for and click on, where those jobs are located, the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job Listings), the Job Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on Indeed, information you provide directly to Indeed including desired salary or past experience, or any of your other behavior on the Site.\nYou know exactly what this data is because you are the person who undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity.\nIf you have an Indeed account or an Indeed Resume, you agree that Indeed may associate this data with your Indeed Profile and use this observed factual data to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who matches your behavior on Indeed.\nYou also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this observed behavior on behalf of Employers or Indeed itself.\nPlease note, the aforementioned actions do not include information sent to you by a third party, however, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site to correspond with a third party.\n<strong>In addition, if you set your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with third-party Employers.\nIf you do not wish to share such information, you may set your Resume to private.</strong>\n</p> 9.\nScreening Tools <p>Indeed may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments.\nIndeed is licensing these tools for Employers\u2019 use as determined by Employers.\nAs a Job Seeker you agree that the Employer has made the determination to use these tools as part of its application process, and the questions asked are solely determined by the Employer, and are not being asked by Indeed.\nThe Employer is the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate and is solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d.\nYou further acknowledge that only the Employer is responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law.\nWhile Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</p> 10.\nGoverning Law and Dispute Resolution <p>This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or related in any way to the Site (\u201cDispute\u201d) will be governed as to all matters, including, but not limited to the validity, construction and performance of this Agreement, by and under the laws of the State of Texas, United States of America, if you are located in the United States, or the laws of the Republic of Ireland, if you are located elsewhere, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles thereof.\nAny and all actions, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings related to such Dispute shall be filed only in courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A., if you are located in the United States, or Dublin, Ireland, if you are located elsewhere.\nEach of the Parties hereby consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A, if you are located in the United States of America, or Dublin, Ireland, if you are located elsewhere.</p>\n<p>You also hereby waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to your use of the Site or these terms of service, if you are located in the United States.</p> 11.\nClass Action Waiver <p>By using the Site and in return for the services offered by Indeed, you acknowledge that Indeed can only offer you these services under the terms and conditions as presented herein.\nAs partial consideration for your use of the Site and these services, you agree not to sue Indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against Indeed regarding your use of the Site.\nAdditionally, as a Job Seeker, your use of job search on the Site is at no charge and you acknowledge that part of the price you are paying to use this Site is your acceptance of these terms of service including this Class Action Waiver.\nIf you do not agree to any part of these terms, do not continue your use of the Site.\nNothing in this paragraph, however, limits your rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff, including in small claims court, subject to Section 10 above.</p> &nbsp.\nB.\nTerms of Service for Employers &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<p>The following terms and conditions apply to all Employers and other users who access or use the Site as intended for individuals and/or organizations seeking to make available information regarding employment openings, on their behalf or other\u2019s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple parties, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement.\nFor purposes of this Section B of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in your capacity as an Employer.</p>\n<strong>1.\nEmployer Accounts</strong>\n<p>When you create an Indeed account, a Company Page or post job listings advertising employment opportunities and other job-related contents, including links to third-party websites (\u201cJob Listings\u201d or \u201cJob Ads\u201d) on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement, the terms associated with any Indeed service you are using, and all of Indeed\u2019s policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you.\nWhen you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek.\nBy using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification through Indeed to Mitek, you are agreeing to share your identification and identity with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data you provide.&nbsp;This process will not involve the capture or storage of any biometric identification or biometric identifiers.</p>\n<p>As an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use.\nIndeed is not responsible for and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party.\nBy registering for an Indeed account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding anomalous activity to your Indeed account.\nIf you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms.</p>\n<p>In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (\u201ca Linked Account\u201d).\nA Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (\u201cAdmin(s)\u201d) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account.\nAdmin(s) can provide these other users varying levels of access and functionality (\u201cRoles\u201d) within the account, as described on the site.\nIf you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you represent to Indeed that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared.\nYou further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys\u2019 fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data and access to your account.\nYou agree that Indeed assumes no liability in regards to the accuracy of the statements above and that you are fully responsible for said accuracy.\nWhen using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, including but not limited to: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access.</p>\n<p>Change of Address: If you have provided a billing address to us, and you change such billing address from an address within the United States to an address outside the United States, or from an address outside of the United States to an address inside the United States, you will continue to be bound by this Agreement with the same Indeed party for the remainder of the calendar month in which you made the change.\nBeginning on the first day of the next calendar month, you hereby agree that you will be bound by this Agreement with the applicable Indeed party identified in the first paragraph of this Agreement with respect to such new territory.</p>\n<p>If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file to pay for one Indeed product or service, Indeed may charge that card for any additional products or services you order.</p>\n<strong>2.\nEmployer Services Including Indeed Apply and Screener Questions</strong>\n<p>You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with your Job Listings, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide us with.\nYou also agree that Indeed may activate a chat bot, which enables Job Seekers to apply to your Job Ad by answering questions.\nThe answers a Job Seeker submits are presented to you as a job application.\nWhen you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate.\nYou agree that by using such candidate management tools, you are instructing Indeed to assemble the candidate\u2019s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document.\nYou further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements.\nBy using these tools, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker.\nAdditionally, you consent to any information shared through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nIndeed may store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for the contents of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, Company Pages that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, and agree that Indeed is not responsible for such content and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal.\nYou agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Company Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason.\nIndeed further does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker\u2019s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data.\nIn the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable.\nIf you do not feel comfortable sending a message, including but not limited to an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed\u2019s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via the personal information provided in such Job Seeker\u2019s resume or application or by whatever method you so choose.\nWhen using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, however, Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by you.\nIn the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom.</p>\n<p>When you use the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Listings, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add functions into the corresponding Indeed Apply emails.\nIn addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview.\nIndeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker\u2019s resume.\nWhen you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction.\nIf you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your candidate dashboard.\nYou further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately.\nWhen you use Indeed\u2019s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to \u201crejected\u201d.\nIf you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices.</p>\n<p>You agree that Indeed may take action to try to identify and reduce spam applications, and that one method of doing so may include imposing a cover letter requirement for such applicants.\nIndeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker\u2019s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker\u2019s qualifications or interest in your job listing.\nYou agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed\u2019s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours\u2019 and the Job Seekers\u2019 sole responsibility.</p>\n<p>By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions.\nYou agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.\nYou also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker\u2019s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions.\nYou consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed\u2019s Privacy Policy.\nIndeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent.</p>\n<p>You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Company Page created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing).\nIndeed may make Job Ad analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed\u2019s discretion.\nTo the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.\nIndeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10% or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.</p>\n<p>When you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise.\nWhen you view, send, store or receive materials through or using the Site or when you simply use or visit the Site, Indeed may inform a Job Seeker that you have taken an action, for example, with regards to a Job Ad, Job Seeker\u2019s Resume, or application such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening the Resume or application, viewing the Resume or application, responding to the Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to the application or Job Ad, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in its sole discretion, may add labels or badges to Employer names or Job Ads, such as, \u201cResponsive Employer\u201d or \u201cActive Employer\u201d.\nIndeed shall determine the method by which such labels or badges are determined or which Employers qualify.\nThe lack of a label or badge may indicate that Indeed does not have sufficient data to determine if an Employer qualifies.\n</p>\n<strong>3.\nJob Match</strong>\n<p>Indeed may use Job Seekers\u2019 application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of their activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of their resume and answers to screener questions match the words of your Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa.\nYou further agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to you as matches or not matches.\nIndeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p>\n<strong>4.\nSalary, Applies or Other Information Provided by Indeed</strong>\n<p>Indeed may provide some information and content to users for informational purposes only.\nFor example, Indeed may provide Job Seekers with data regarding estimated salaries for a given Job Listing, or provide you with estimated applies to your Job Listing.\nAll such figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy.\nWith respect to information regarding estimated applies, if you are participating in the Indeed Ads Program, please note that this is not the information you are purchasing from Indeed and you are not charged per apply.\nIndeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site.\nPlease note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates.\nThese figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only.\nMinimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.\nIndeed may also provide data regarding impressions in relation to your job ad.\nSuch figures are provided for informational purposes only, are subject to change at any time, and Indeed does not guarantee their accuracy.\nIndeed reserves the right to change the method of measuring such figures at any time.</p>\n<strong>5.\nScreening Tools</strong>\n<p>Indeed may make available to you&nbsp.\nscreening tools for your use during the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and assessments.\nIndeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine.\nBy using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed.\nYou are the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate.\nYou are solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d.\n<strong>You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent or similar law.</strong> While Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.\nYou agree to indemnify Indeed for any and all claims arising out of your use of a Screening Tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar or equivalent law, or that such Screening Tool results in a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d.</p>\n<p>Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.\nActivating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message on the Employer\u2019s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application.\nTo prevent a rejection notice from being sent, you must indicate your interest in the application on Indeed.&nbsp;Any interactions you have directly with a Job Seeker and not through a tool provided by Indeed (for example, calling or emailing a Job Seeker directly instead of through an Indeed Relay Service) are not visible to Indeed, and will not prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.\nIf you activate Employer Assist then you must interact with a Job Seeker through a tool provided by Indeed to prevent an Employer Assist rejection notice from being sent.\nIf you activate Employer Assist you agree that you are instructing Indeed to send these messages to candidates with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame, and you agree to indemnify Indeed from any claims arising therefrom.</p>\n<strong>6.\nCommunication through Indeed</strong>\n<p>You may receive messages, emails or email notifications corresponding with your or a Job Seeker\u2019s activity on or use of the Site Indeed Apply, Indeed Chat, or any other communications service, product, or feature provided on or through the Site.\nIn all cases, such messages or notifications are provided solely as a

Indeed can only offer Publisher these services under the terms and conditions as presented herein.\nAs partial consideration for Publisher\u2019s use of the Site and these services, Publisher agrees not to sue Indeed as a class plaintiff or class representative, join as a class member, or participate as an adverse party in any way in a class-action lawsuit against Indeed regarding Publisher\u2019s use of the Site.\nAdditionally, as a Publisher, the use of the Site is at no charge and Publisher acknowledges that part of the price it is paying to use this Site is its acceptance of these terms of service including this Class Action Waiver.\nIf Publisher does not agree to any part of these terms, Publisher should not continue use of the Site.\nNothing in this paragraph, however, limits Publisher\u2019s rights to bring a lawsuit as an individual plaintiff, including in small claims court, subject to the jurisdiction requirements found in Section 9 above.</p> &nbsp.\nD.\nTerms of Service for All Users &nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<p>The following terms and conditions apply to all Job Seekers, Employers, Publishers and other users who access or use the Site, or otherwise indicate their acceptance to this Agreement.\nFor purposes of this Section D of the Indeed General Terms of Service, all references to \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d shall mean you, the individual or organization accessing this Site in any capacity.</p>\n<strong>1.\nAccessing External Sites</strong>\n<p>The Site contains links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and/or operated by third-party vendors and other third parties (the \u201cExternal Sites\u201d).\nYou acknowledge that Indeed is not responsible or liable for any such third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or through any External Sites.\nYou should contact the site administrator or webmaster for the applicable External Site if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on an External Site.</p>\n<p>In addition, Indeed may provide you with links to third party sites that offer you services for your use or benefit.\nWe may stop offering any such third party sites or services at any time.\n<strong>If you choose to use such third party sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at your own risk.</strong> When entering into an agreement with such parties, you are giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are determined by their privacy policies and terms of service.\n<strong>We are not responsible for any content or services provided by these third parties, and disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such third parties.</strong>\n<strong>We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party.\nYou will be notified on the site that these are third party sites and services, and not Indeed.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For example, Indeed may provide you with access to a link on Indeed to background check services offered and performed by a third party (each a \u201cThird-Party Background Check Service\u201d).\nThis service may be offered in the form of permitting a Jobseeker to request their own background check or permitting an Employer to request a background check of a Jobseeker.\nIf you choose to use this link and these services, you are contracting directly with the Third-Party Background Check Service, and Indeed is not a party to this contract.\nPlease note (and you acknowledge) that Indeed cannot and does not assemble, access, view, analyze, manipulate, alter, evaluate or store the background check reports provided by any Third-Party Background Check Service to you or to any other Indeed user.\nIndeed operates solely as a technical conduit, allowing the transmission of background checks sent by a Third-Party Background Check Service to you.\nFurther, you agree to fully indemnify and defend Indeed for any claims arising out of your use of a Third-Party Background Check Service\u2019s services or a background check provided to you by a Third-Party Background Check Service.</p>\n<p>Pages on the Site may embed content and information provided by third-party APIs, which is subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by those third parties.\nFor example, the Site may include Google Maps features and content, which is subject to the current versions of: (1) the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service.\nand (2) the Google Privacy Policy.\nInformation on Company Pages includes publicly available information and/or information provided by the respective company and/or may come from third parties.\nFor example, data about companies located in Japan may come from Toyo Keizai Shinpo Inc.</p>\n<p>Please note that while this Agreement describes Indeed\u2019s services generally, services may differ by availability, and you should check the Site in your location to see which services are available to you.\nFor example, while some parts of this Agreement describe matching services, Indeed does not offer any matching services in Japan.</p>\n<strong>2.\nUsing our Site</strong>\n<p>Use of any automated system or software, whether operated by a third party or otherwise, to extract data from the Site (such as screen scraping or crawling) is prohibited.\nIndeed reserves the right to take such action as it considers necessary, including issuing legal proceedings without further notice, in relation to any unauthorized use of the Site.\nIf you wish to make commercial use of the Site, if you wish to make use of the Site in any capacity other than that of a Jobseeker or Employer, or if you wish to purchase Indeed services that utilize the Site, you must have a prior written agreement with Indeed to do so, or have accepted Indeed\u2019s online terms of service.\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWe reserve the right at all times (but will not have any obligation) to terminate users, and reclaim usernames or URLs, for any reason.</p>\n<strong>3.\nUser Content</strong>\n<p>Some parts of the Site, such as message boards and forums or job posting pages, may allow users to post content like Job Listings, resumes, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on or through the Site, or any materials that a user submits to Indeed, including where it is stated that such materials may be posted on the Site or a third party website, are referred to herein as \u201cUser Content\u201d).\nSuch functionality is designed to help users obtain career and company information, to let users know of jobs, to provide information about potential job candidates, and facilitate other communication.\nUser Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names.\nUser Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive.\nFor example, the Site hosts Company Pages, which allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company who owns the Company Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&amp;A questions on Company Pages.\nIndeed does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein.\nSome elements of Indeed job search results pages may appear to be content produced by Indeed, but are actually a reproduction of user-generated search queries.\nYou acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.</p>\n<p>You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content.\nYou must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.</p>\n<p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver\u2019s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier.\nPosting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences.\nIndeed may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information.\nIndeed reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.</p>\n<p>Although Indeed has no obligation to do so, Indeed may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in Indeed\u2019s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), or that Indeed deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate.\nIf you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please contact Indeed immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to host or remove any User Content, and i) the interpretation of whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy, ii) whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and iii) whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on Indeed, will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed.\nYou agree that Indeed has no liability to you or anyone else arising from its editorial decisions.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Indeed is an interactive computer service and does not have any obligation to screen any User Content, or to include any User Content (including without limitation Job Ads) in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any User Content from publication for any or no reason.</p>\n<p>Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site.\nto protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors.\nand to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests.\nThis means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user\u2019s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information.\nWhen you post on Indeed confidentially or otherwise (e.g.\nanonymous Company Reviews or a confidential Job Ad), your identity may be discoverable by legal request,&nbsp;including, but not limited to, requests from the government or law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Indeed reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers.\nDirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability.\nIndirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements.\nYou understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p>\n<p>Please note: Section 230 of the U.S.\nCommunications Decency Act provides that:<br>\n<strong>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</strong>\n<br> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.<br>\n<strong>(2) Civil liability</strong>\n<br> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-<br>\n<strong>(A)</strong> any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\nor<br>\n<strong>(B)</strong> any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).</p>\n<strong>4.\nLicense to User Content and Feedback</strong>\n<p>Only to the extent permitted by law, you grant Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, (revocable only as

from any claims resulting from any such User Content.\nIf you wish to request to revoke the license granted by you in this Section for any such User Content, please send a certified letter of request to the postal address listed above with a copy of your passport or national identity card (for identity verification purposes) and request removal of such User Content.\nYour certified letter of request must include (a) the signature of the applicable rights holder for such User Content or a person authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder.\n(b) identification of the User Content for which the license is to be revoked, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate and remove such User Content on the Site.\n(c) your name, address, telephone number, and email address.\n(d) a statement that you have a good faith belief that you are the rights holder or authorized by the rights holder to revoke the license for the designated User Content.\nand (e) a statement that the information in the request is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rights holder or are authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder with respect to such User Content.\nThere may be a charge for answering and executing such a request.\nplease contact Indeed for more details.</p>\n<p>At your discretion, you may provide feedback and related materials to Indeed concerning the functionality and performance of the Site from time to time, including, without limitation, identifying potential errors, improvements, modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements

any form to any third party without restriction.\nBy providing any Feedback, you agree that your provision of such Feedback is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction, and will not place Indeed under any fiduciary, confidentiality or other obligation, and that we are free to use such Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and free to disclose such Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone.\nYou further acknowledge that, by accepting any Feedback, Indeed does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Indeed, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p>\n<strong>5.\nRules for Using Our Site</strong>\n<p>You agree not to access (or attempt to access) the Site by any means other

requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.\nThe notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC.\n\u00a7 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\n(b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple

law.\nand (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\nIf you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice.\nNotices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA.\nsee http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details.\nNotices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending

&nbsp.\n&nbsp.\n<p>These Indeed Ads Program Terms (\u201cIAP Terms\u201d) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the&nbsp;Indeed Terms of Service&nbsp;(the \u201cAgreement\u201d), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Ads Program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Ads Program Terms.</p>\n<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IAP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n<strong>1.\nThe</strong> Program <p>Use of the Indeed Ads Program (\u201cProgram\u201d) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy and those instructions provided on the Website, if you are using the Ads Program, through our on-line forms.\nIndeed policies may be modified at any time.\nWith regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed, either for payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to Indeed via an XML feed (\u201cJob Listings\u201d or \u201cJob Ads\u201d), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content (including job descriptions and screener questions) and target URLs (\u201cCreative\u201d), whether generated by or for you, including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed.\nand (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively \u201cYour Services\u201d).\nYou shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own and any third party\u2019s use of your accounts.\nJob Ads may be placed on (y) any content, service, or property provided by Indeed (\u201cIndeed Property\u201d), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third party (\u201cPublisher\u201d) upon which Indeed places Job Ads or provides search results of Job Listings (\u201cPublisher Property\u201d).\nIndeed does not guarantee performance or placement of Job Ads, and distribution on Indeed and Publisher Properties may vary depending on demand, industry, sponsorship, and other considerations.\nBy sponsoring a Job Ad, you are agreeing to pay a price for each user \u201cclick\u201d (a user action that results in a job description being displayed to the user) that such an ad receives.\nBy sponsoring a Job Ad you are requesting that Indeed manage the visibility of your Job Ads in the Indeed Search Engine Results Page to give your job exposure, in a way designed to make the experience on Indeed better for you and get your jobs better visibility.\n\u201cExposure\u201d does not always mean the Job Ad will get a particular spot on the page, or that it will be called out with special wording, but means that it will be placed by Indeed in accordance with Indeed judgment and discretion in order to achieve what Indeed determines, in its sole discretion, to be the best visibility for such a job, considering the budget.\nBy sponsoring a job you are requesting Indeed to manage this relative visibility and exposure on its search engine results page.\nYou acknowledge and agree that such management of sponsored Job Ads is in Indeed\u2019s sole discretion and is provided without warranty as to how and where Indeed shall place such Job Ads.\nYou shall direct only to Indeed any communications regarding Job Ads on Publisher Properties.\nBy posting or sponsoring a Job Ad on Indeed, including but not limited to by XML feed: you agree that Indeed may and authorize Indeed to reformat and host (but not change the content of) the Job Ad on an Indeed hosted page or in its publisher network in any way Indeed sees fit.\nAll dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open an Indeed reformatted or hosted page.\nIn the event you provide Indeed with an indication that you are looking to fill your role in a short time period, as determined by Indeed, Indeed may add a label (such as \u201cUrgent\u201d, \u201cUrgently Hiring\u201d or similar) next to the word \u201cSponsored\u201d on the search results page where your Job Ad is displayed.\nIndeed may use words or phrases interchangeably (for example, \u201cAd\u201d, \u201cUrgently Hiring\u201d, \u201cPaid\u201d, \u201cPromoted\u201d, \u201cSponsored\u201d, \u201cUrgent\u201d or similar) in connection with a sponsored advertisement on Indeed.\nJob Ads posted directly on Indeed may no longer appear on the Site after a period of time.\nin some cases, these Job Ads may need to be sponsored in order to remain visible or become visible again.\nHowever, Job Ads indexed by Indeed will expire after a period of time and Indeed is unable to restore their visibility.\nIf you sponsor a Job Ad but do not provide a payment method for your campaign, the job campaign will not begin and your Job Ad will not be visible.\nIndeed may in its sole discretion remove the budget and post the job with organic visibility.\nIndeed may require sponsorship for the display of any Job Ad at any time for any reason.\nIndeed may recommend or suggest a budget for any Job Ad to maintain or optimize its visibility.\nThe suggestion is made without warranty and is not a guarantee regarding placement or visibility of any Job Ad.\nIf you are located in Japan, you acknowledge that Indeed\u2019s content moderation policies may, in some instances, result in the modification of your Job Ad, and you agree to this activity.\nIf you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible to participate in an Indeed partnership program.\nAgency partners in this program may attain the rank of \u201cGold\u201d, \u201cSilver\u201d, or \u201cBronze\u201d based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue.\nIndeed\u2019s determination of an agency\u2019s rank is made at Indeed\u2019s full discretion and may be revoked at any time.\nIndeed may offer some Employers who sponsor Job Ads the opportunity to be displayed more prominently, or in an enhanced way, on the Site (\u201cFeatured Employer\u201d).\nFeatured Employer is awarded at Indeed\u2019s sole discretion.\nThe ability to receive Featured Employer, generally, is a function of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend.\nA Featured Employer may also receive subscriptions to the Indeed Resume Program for a limited time (\u201cResume Rewards\u201d), which are awarded at Indeed\u2019s sole discretion.\nThe Featured Employer program and Resume Rewards may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Cost per Apply.</b> Indeed may offer a tool permitting an Employer to set a Sponsored Job advertising budget on a per-apply basis, referred to as either \u201ccost-per-apply\u201d or \u201cpay-per-apply.\u201d&nbsp;Employers may be placed into a test group and offered the cost-per-apply product by default.\nIf you are placed in such a test group and wish to purchase a cost-per-click advertising plan instead of cost-per-apply, contact Client Success at 1-800-475-4361.\nCharges are based on applies (\u201cApplies\u201d or \u201cApply\u201d), defined as an application to one of your Job Ads delivered by Indeed on the Site.\nIndeed may offer estimates regarding the number of Applies for a given budget.\nthis information is based on estimates only and is not a guarantee of future performance or of any particular number of Applies.\nBy selecting a desired number of Applies on the Site, you are requesting Indeed to display your Job Ad in Indeed\u2019s sole discretion, using the budget you have selected.\nYou will be charged upon the earlier of a) your ad campaign spending $500.00 or more or b) the beginning of the next calendar month after you sponsor your Job Ad.\nIf you previously purchased cost-per-click Sponsored Jobs on the same account, you may also be charged once your Job Ad campaign spends $25.00.\nThe campaign for your Job Ad will automatically pause after the number of Applies you have selected are delivered.\n<em>\n<b>Charges are solely based on Indeed\u2019s Apply measurements.\nIndeed\u2019s determination of Apply count shall be binding.</b>\n</em> Indeed and its affiliates, and its and their third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning, accuracy, or the levels or timing of: (i)&nbsp;costs per Apply, (ii) delivery of any Applies, (iii) the interest level of any users who Apply to or view your job.&nbsp;Indeed further disclaims all guarantees regarding analytics and statistics provided to Employers in the cost-per-apply test group, as such information may be inaccurate or outdated during the test.</p>\n<p>Indeed may offer conversion tracking feature that Employers may install on their own websites (\u201cConversion Tracker\u201d).\nThe Conversion Tracker will inform Indeed when a Job Seeker completes an application on the Employer website, allowing those applications to appear in the Employer Dashboard.\nBy installing or using a Conversion Tracker, you represent and warrant that you shall do so in accordance with all applicable laws, including without limitation that you shall provide users of your website with all necessary disclosures, and obtain any necessary consent or agreement from such users, to permit the Conversion Tracker to function in accordance with applicable law, and you agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any failure to do so.\nThe Conversion Tracker is provided on an \u201cas-is\u201d and \u201cas-available\u201d basis, and without warranty.\nIndeed disclaims all liability for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Conversion Tracker.</p>\n<strong>2.\nCancellation</strong>\n<p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any advertisement at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours).\nIndeed may immediately cancel the Program or these IAP Terms at any time upon notice.\nIndeed may modify the Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms.\nSections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IAP Terms.</p>\n<strong>3.\nProhibited Uses</strong>\n<p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks.\nor (b) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed.\nYou represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current.\n(y) you hold and grant Indeed and Publishers all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (\u201cUse\u201d).\nand (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws.\nViolation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IAP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.&nbsp;Indeed or Publishers may reject or remove any Job Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer\u2019s account, for any or no reason without notice.&nbsp;Although Indeed may indicate why a job or account has been removed or disabled, we cannot give every reason why a job or a company may be removed, and we always retain the right to remove any job, organic or sponsored, if we feel it is in our interest or our users\u2019 interest.\nFor examples of why Indeed may reject such Job Ads from Employers, refer to&nbsp;Indeed\u2019s Search Quality Policies, which are provided by way of illustration and are not exhaustive.&nbsp;<b>By submitting your Job Ad to Indeed, you agree that Indeed is under no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Job Ad.</b> That decision is entirely Indeed\u2019s in its sole discretion.&nbsp.\nThe Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.\nIndeed may require some Job Ads to be sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the Job Ad and/or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, to improve our services, or for any other reason in Indeed\u2019s sole discretion.\nIndeed may also limit the number of free Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time in Indeed\u2019s sole discretion.\nFor example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, hard-to-fill jobs, jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed.\nAdditionally, Indeed may choose not to accept an employer\u2019s XML feed or any Job Ads in an XML feed for any or no reason.\nIf you are a job board as determined by Indeed, Indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or all of your Job Ads.\nBy submitting Job Ads to Indeed, you agree that the determination as to whether you are deemed to be a job board is made by Indeed in its sole discretion, and such decision is binding, and you agree that Indeed is under no obligation to accept, host, or publish your Job Ad.\nThat decision is entirely Indeed\u2019s in its sole discretion.\nThe Indeed team responsible for maintaining the quality of the Site is independent, and its decisions are final and not subject to review.\nFor examples of why Indeed may stop accepting such Job Ads from job boards, refer to the Job Board Inclusion Guidelines.\nAs a job board, you may only post Job Ads on the Site for your own company.\nyou may not post Job Ads on the Site for your clients and if you do or attempt to do so, Indeed reserves the right to disable your account.\nIndeed further reserves the right to reject any Job Ads which advertise staffing opportunities

acceptance of these Indeed Resume Program Terms.</p>\n<p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n<strong>1.\nThe Program</strong>\n<p>Use of the Indeed Resume Program (\u201cProgram\u201d) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, \u201cResume Owner\u201d) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription for, any or all of which may be modified at any time.\nPurchasing additional subscriptions or modifying subscriptions may reset the monthly billing date for subscriptions associated with your account, resulting in pro rata charges to account for the new date.\nYou shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings.\nContact information provided by Indeed, including any Relay Service email address, is for your individual use only and may not be shared with any other person.\nYou are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system.\nUse of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program.\nIn addition, as a feature of the IRP, Indeed may send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker\u2019s resume.</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are paying Indeed the amount indicated on the Site for the purpose of Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed, or by connecting you via phone call to the number provided by the Resume Owner.\nYour use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services.\nIndeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner\u2019s resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.\n<strong>Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.</strong>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In addition, in accord with the Agreement, you expressly agree that Indeed does not allow its Resume Contact service to be used in a spam like manner, which

or spam, or for any or no reason.\n<strong>The only acceptable use of the IRP is for you to contact a Resume Owner through Indeed regarding a Job Listing or potential employment.\nNo other uses of the IRP are permitted.&nbsp;</strong>Scraping the Indeed Resume database or using the Indeed Resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you.\nAdditionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Resume database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Indeed Resume database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Indeed Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice and you consent to the same.\nEach Resume subscription is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In the event phone numbers are provided by the Job Seeker in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their

the Indeed Terms of Service (the \u201cAgreement\u201d).\nBy using Indeed Assessments as an Employer in any way, or by registering as an Employer on Indeed Assessments, you agree to these Indeed Assessments Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.\nAny capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p> 1.\nIntroduction <p>Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of skills assessments selected by Employers (\u201cAssessments\u201d) and responses from Job Seekers&nbsp.\n(\u201cResponses\u201d) through the Site.</p> 2.\nAssessments <p>You agree that any Assessment sent by Indeed to a Job Seeker is done so at your sole request, and you represent and warrant that you have that Job Seeker\u2019s consent for Indeed to contact that Job Seeker for the purpose of transmitting the Assessment(s) you have selected.\nYou also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Assessment to a Job Seeker, that request cannot be canceled.\nIndeed does not guarantee that any Job Seeker will receive, access, read or respond to any Assessment, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data.\nHowever, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</p>\n<p>You agree you have made the determination to use Indeed Assessments as part of your application process, and that the types of questions asked in any Assessment or bundle of Assessments you send to a Job Seeker are solely being asked by you and are not being asked by Indeed.\nYou agree you are solely responsible for the use of Assessments and Responses in compliance with the law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state statutes.\nYou are solely responsible for your use of Indeed Assessments, including without limitation any results which are considered to have a \u201cdisparate impact.\u201d You further agree that you are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act.\nYou acknowledge that Indeed may, but is not obligated to, provide a means by which Job Seekers may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from you.\nWhile Indeed is guided by WCAG 2.1, Level AA in our efforts to design and develop accessible offerings, as outlined in the accessibility statement, Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent or similar law.</p>\n<p>You are the sole party to determine which Assessment to send to any Job Seeker.\nYou agree that an Assessment is only designed to evaluate a particular skill.\nIt does not evaluate a Job Seeker\u2019s qualification for any job nor their ability to safely perform a job.\nWhether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Job Seeker is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by you.\nIndeed reserves the right to change any Assessment or the questions asked within an Assessment at any time, for any or no reason, including but not limited to quality control.</p>\n<p>Sending an Assessment to a Job Seeker does not guarantee a Response or any further communication or action by any job Seeker.\nYou consent to your Assessment and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed\u2019s Privacy Policy.</p> 3.\nResponses&nbsp.\n<p>A Job Seeker may, but is not required to, provide a Response to an Assessment sent by an Employer.\nAfter a Job Seeker has provided a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response.\nA Job Seeker may also have the option to select an Assessment and associate the Response with their Indeed Profile, which will be visible to Employers in accordance with our Terms.\nIf there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Job Seeker will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</p>\n<p>As an Employer you are the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified Job Seeker.\nYou may instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to you, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections.\nAs the employer, you are the sole party to determine whether to offer a Job Seeker the&nbsp.\nopportunity to retake any Assessment that you sent or update or modify their Response.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Responses are only provided on the condition that you use them responsibly and legally as part of your hiring process, which includes considering any other relevant information about the Job Seeker.\nIndeed may display excerpts from or summaries of Responses in other products such as Indeed Resume.\nThese summaries are for convenience only and are not to be used in lieu of the full Response in context.\nYou agree not to rely solely on such excerpts or summaries when making a hiring decision regarding any Job Seeker.</p> 4.\nRules For Using Indeed Assessments <p>As an Employer, you represent and warrant that you shall not access or use Indeed Assessments for any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose.\nYou shall not create or send any Assessment which is directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content.\nYou shall not create or send any Assessment containing proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing).</p>\n<p>Indeed Assessments is not a tool to ask for sensitive personal data from Job Seekers.\nEmployers may not create or send any Assessment which seeks highly confidential personal information from Job Seekers, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of personal data subject to data breach notification requirements in any country.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An Employer who receives an accommodation request through Indeed Assessments must provide an accommodation to the extent required by applicable law, and further must provide evidence of compliance to Indeed immediately upon request.\nAny failure to fulfill these obligations is a material breach of this Agreement and Indeed may immediately terminate your account and your access to Indeed Assessments with no further obligation to you.\nYou agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any claims arising from your failure to comply with this section.</p>\n<p>\n<b>\n<i>You understand and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Assessment or Response, or to publish any Assessment or Response on the Site, and may exclude or remove any Assessment or Response from the Site for any or no reason without liability or notice.</i>\n</b>\n</p> 5.\nIndeed\u2019s Role <p>Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool.\nBy using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Job Seekers.\nIndeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Job Seekers to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine.\nThe sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Job Seekers as applicable.</p>\n<p>Indeed cannot confirm the information submitted by anyJob Seeker, or other user, including the identity of any user.\nIndeed does not inquire into the backgrounds of Job Seekers or attempt to verify the statements of Job Seekers.\nYou are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Job Seeker.\nYou are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Job Seeker.\nFurther, for any skill area in which formal licenses or certifications may exist, Assessments do not act as a substitute for such license or certification and do not speak to whether a Job Seeker is qualified for or has such a license or certification.\nIt is the Employer\u2019s sole responsibility to determine what licenses or certifications are required for their job and whether a Job Seeker has such license or certification.\nIndeed also makes no statement as to whether a particular skill is necessary for a job and it is an Employer\u2019s sole responsibility to make such a determination (or seek appropriate legal counsel to do so), in accordance with the EEOC regulations or other applicable laws.</p>\n<p>Indeed is not a party to, third party beneficiary of, or liable for, any agreements, offers, or promises between an Employer and Job Seeker, regardless of whether Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction.\nIndeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</p>\n<p>Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</p> 6.\nFees <p>Indeed Assessments is currently free for Employers.\nIndeed may, in its sole discretion and at any time, end Employers\u2019 free use of Indeed Assessments and begin to charge Employers to use Indeed Assessments as a standalone product or in conjunction with an Employer\u2019s use of any other Indeed product.</p> 7.\nConfidentiality <p>You agree to keep all information gained from using Indeed Assessments confidential.\nYou agree that (1) you will use any content submitted by Job Seekers only in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws.\n(2) you will not disclose the names or identities or share the profile of any Job Seekers outside of your recruiting or hiring department.\nand (3) you will take appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect content you obtain through use of Indeed Assessments from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.</p> 8.\nDisclaimer and Limitation of Liability <p>INDEED ASSESSMENTS AND ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION, ASSESSMENTS, RESPONSES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE ON

snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement.\nAny removal of the tracker snippet, or any provision of a method, for Job Seekers to apply to the Job Ad, bypassing the conversion tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle Indeed to any resulting damages.\nIt shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place.\nThe conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity.\nAdditionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process.\nIf you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that job seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed with the application process through the ITA ad, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action.\nYou further acknowledge that your use of these questions is provided to you via a license to the application questions tool.\nIndeed disclaims all warranties as to the performance of these questions, including but not limited to the accuracy of the job seekers\u2019 answers to your application questions.\n&nbsp;</p> 2.&nbsp;Cancellation <p>Unless otherwise stated in an insertion order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any Targeted Ad at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours for any Targeted Ad displayed on Indeed).\nIndeed may cancel ITA or these ITA Terms at any time.\nIndeed may modify ITA or these ITA Terms at any time without liability, and your use of ITA after notice that these ITA Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated ITA Terms.\nSections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these ITA Terms.</p> 3.&nbsp;Prohibited Uses <p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions, applies, or clicks.\n(b) cause the under reporting, or circumvent or prevent the reporting of an application by any means, including but not limited to, by providing an alternative method for a Job Seeker to submit an application to your Job Ad and bypassing the Post Apply Page.\nor (c) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country
