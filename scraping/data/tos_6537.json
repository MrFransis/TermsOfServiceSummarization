Prevention<p>\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to suspend a User withdrawal request if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent.</p>\n<p>If we become aware that any funds received into an

the funds in your Account (thereby preventing any use of the funds) if:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we believe there may be an unacceptable level of risk associated with you, your Account, or any or all of your transactions, including if we believe that there is a risk that such funds will be subject to reversal or chargeback;</li>\n<li>we believe that the beneficiary of the payment is someone other than

followed.\nor (2) our fees and charges, the process set out in the Clause \"Disputes with Us\" must be followed.\n</p>\n<p> If we agree to the refund, the funds will be received by the User via the

chargebacks, we may suspend, limit or close your Account.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> 20.\nWithdrawals <p>\n</p>\n<p> Your first withdrawal of funds earned may be delayed for up to fifteen days for security and

(being a challenge to a payment that a User files with their card issuer or financial institution), and any subsequent reversal instruction, is made by the payment product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors) and not by us.\nWe are bound to follow such instructions.\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge and agree that we will be entitled to recover any chargebacks and reversals that may

product issuer or third parties (such as payment processors).\nIf you initiate any chargeback request or other \"Request for Information\" or similar process, you expressly agree and consent to us to

privately, to attempt to avoid fees;</li>\n<li>if we determine that you have infringed legal rights (resulting in actual or potential claims), including infringing Intellectual Property

reasons.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> If we close your Account due to your breach of this User Agreement, you may also become liable for certain fees as described in this User Agreement.\n</p>\n<p> Without limiting our other remedies, to the extent you have breached this User Agreement, you must pay us all fees owed to us and reimburse us for all losses and costs (including any and all of our employee time) and reasonable expenses (including legal fees) related to investigating such breach and collecting such fees.\n</p>\n<p> You acknowledge and agree that: (1) the damages that we will sustain as a result of your breach of this User Agreement will be substantial and will potentially include (without limitation) fines and other related expenses imposed on us by our payment processors and Users and that those damages may be extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain.\n(2) if you breach this User Agreement, we may fine you up to US$3,000 for each breach and/or we may take legal action against you to recover losses that are in excess of the fine amount.\n(3) a fine of up to US$3,000 is a presently reasonable pre-estimate or minimum estimate of our damages, considering all currently existing circumstances, including (without limitation) the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to us that reasonably could be anticipated and the anticipation that proof of actual damages may be impractical or extremely difficult.\nand (4) we may release the entire (or part of the) amount of the fine from your Account to us.\n</p>\n<p> If we close your Account for a reason other than as a result of your breach of this User Agreement, unless as otherwise specified in this User Agreement, you will be entitled to receive any payment due from us to you.\n</p>\n<p> In the event that we close your Account, you will have no claim whatsoever against us in respect of any such suspension or termination of your Account.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> 24.\nMilestone Payments <p>\n</p>\n<p> Subject to Section 25, we do not operate an escrow service in relation to the Website.\nFreelancer separately owns and operates a business known as Escrow.com - for the avoidance of doubt this business is separate and there is no connection between terms, conditions, products and services offered on Freelancer and services offered on Escrow.com.\nWe do however, provide a service on this Website which allows controlled payments to be made with respect to a service, called Milestone Payments.\n</p>\n<p> Subject to the User Contract, the Buyer can make a Milestone Payment subject to Section 25, which will be locked from the Buyer's Account and cannot be claimed by the Seller until: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>the Buyer and Seller agree that the funds can be claimed by the Seller;</li>\n<li>if there is a dispute, the Buyer and Seller have concluded the Dispute Resolution Process and the Dispute is resolved in the Seller's favour;</li>\n<li>the Buyer instructs us to pay a Seller for services performed by the Seller in respect of a Project or Contest.\nor</li>\n<li>the Buyer acknowledges that the Seller has completed the services fully and satisfactory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p> If a Buyer does not approve of the Seller's work product, the parties may elect to resolve the issue under the Dispute Resolution Process.\n</p>\n<p> If we have not received any instructions or dispute from a Buyer or Seller in respect of a Milestone Payment within six months or any other reasonable length of time after the day that the Milestone Payment was paid and the Buyer has not logged into their Account during that time, the Milestone Payment will be unlocked and released back to the Buyer.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> 25.\nRequirements for Californian Users and Milestone Payments <p>\n</p>\n<p> In the state of California, United States of America, Milestone Payments are regarded as regulated escrow activity.\n</p>\n<p> This Section deals with and applies to Milestone Payments that are connected to California, i.e.\nwhere a User, being a Buyer or a Seller, is ordinarily resident in California, United States of America (\u201cCalifornia User\u201d or \u201cCalifornia Users\u201d).\n</p>\n<p> So that we can continue to serve our California Users, Escrow.com (a business owned and separately operated by Freelancer) will facilitate escrow transactions on behalf of a Buyer and/or Seller either of whom is a California User, and to hold the funds in relation to any Project.\nUntil further notice, there will be no additional Fees for facilitating an escrow transaction initiated as a result of this Section.\n</p>\n<p> Where a California User is a Buyer or Seller in relation to any Project, and a Buyer seeks to initiate a Milestone Payment, the Users will be directed to complete Milestone Payments through Escrow.com as a Transaction (\u2018California Transaction\u201d) in accordance with the Escrow.com Terms of Use and General Escrow Instructions.\n</p>\n<p> The Escrow.com Group includes Escrow.com Inc.\nand Internet Escrow Services, Inc (\u201cIES\u201d) which are owned and operated by a wholly owned subsidiary in the Freelancer Group.\nIES is a licensed Escrow Agent in the state of California holding Escrow Agent License No.\n9631867, issued by the California Department of Business Oversight.\nAs part of using

completion of the work related to the Milestone Payment, the Seller will direct IES to disburse the proceeds of the Escrow.com Transaction to the User\u2019s Account with Freelancer.\n</p> Accepted Currencies for Milestone Payments and California Users <p> Escrow.com currently supports Transactions in three currencies.\nU.S.\nDollars, Euros and Australian Dollars (\u201cSupported Currencies\u201d).\nIf a Buyer's Payment Method is denominated in a currency other than the supported currencies, a currency conversion will be required for the Milestone Payment to be made and an Escrow.com Transaction to proceed.\nWe will display foreign currency conversion rates that Freelancer, Escrow, or our Affiliates currently make available to convert supported foreign currencies to one of the Supported Currencies.\n</p>\n<p> These foreign currency conversion rates adjust regularly based on market conditions.\nWholesale currency conversion rates at which Freelancer or our Affiliates obtain foreign currency will usually be different than the foreign currency conversion rates offered on the Site.\nEach User, in its sole discretion and risk, may authorize the charge, debit, or credit of its Payment Method in a supported foreign currency and the conversion of the payment to one of the supported currencies at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site.\nA list of supported foreign currencies is available on the Site.\nIf foreign currency conversion is required to make a payment in one of the Supported Currencies and either Freelancer, Escrow, or our Affiliates does not support the foreign currency or the User does not authorize the conversion of such payment at the foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site, Escrow or one of our Affiliates will charge, debit, or credit the User's Payment Method and the User's Payment Method provider will convert the payment at a foreign currency conversion rate selected by the User's Payment Method provider.\nThe User's Payment Method provider may also charge fees directly to the Payment Method even when no currency conversion is involved.\nThe User's authorization of a payment using a foreign currency conversion rate displayed on the Site is at the User's sole risk.\nFreelancer, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when billing or crediting a Payment Method denominated in a currency other than one of the Supported Currencies.\nFreelancer, Escrow, and our Affiliates are not responsible for currency fluctuations that occur when receiving or sending payments to and from the Escrow Account.\n</p> Release and Delivery of Amounts in Escrow <p> Buyers and Sellers in a California Transaction irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to release applicable portions of the Milestone Payment in an Escrow Account (each portion, a \u201cRelease\u201d) to their Seller Escrow Account or in the event of a refund, the Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable, upon the occurrence of and in accordance with one or more Release Conditions provided below or as otherwise required by applicable law or the Terms of Service.\nThe amount of any Release will be delivered to the applicable Freelancer Account in accordance with Seller\u2019s or Buyer\u2019s authorization, as above, these Instructions, and the IES Terms of Service and General Escrow Instructions.\n</p>\n<p> As used in these Instructions, \u201cRelease Condition\u201d means any of the following: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buyer clicks to release funds to Seller.</li>\n<li>Buyer does not take any action for 14 days from the date of a Seller\u2019s Release request, in which case Seller and Buyer agree that IES is authorized and irrevocably instructed to immediately release to Seller the amount associated in the applicable milestone in connection with such Release request.</li>\n<li>Seller cancels the contract before a Milestone Payment has been released to Seller, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</li>\n<li>Buyer and Seller have submitted joint written instructions for a Release to either Seller Escrow Account or Buyer Escrow Account, as applicable.</li>\n<li>Buyer and Seller agree to close the contract without release of funds, in which case the funds are to be returned to the Buyer.</li>\n<li>Buyer or Seller has failed to make its Arbitration payment or paid its fair share of the Arbitration costs pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Party that has made its Arbitration Payment.</li>\n<li>Both Buyer and Seller have failed to timely submit to Arbitration for an unresolved Dispute as such term is defined in the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the Buyer.</li>\n<li>Buyer or Seller has failed timely to respond to a Freelancer Dispute Resolution Service notification as required by the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are released to the User that has participated.</li>\n<li>Buyer or Seller otherwise has failed to comply with the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds are to be released to the User that has complied with the Dispute Resolution Service.</li>\n<li>Submittal of a final award of an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the Dispute Resolution Service, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such award.</li>\n<li>Issuance of the final order of a court of competent jurisdiction from which appeal is not taken, in which case the funds will be released in accordance with such order.</li>\n<li>Freelancer believes, in our sole discretion, that fraud, non-payment, illegal act, or a violation of Freelancer\u2019s User Agreement has been committed or is being committed or attempted, in which case Buyer and Seller irrevocably authorize and instruct IES to take such actions as Freelancer deems appropriate in our sole discretion and in accordance with applicable law, in order to prevent or remedy such acts, including without limitation to return the funds associated with such acts to their source of payment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>
