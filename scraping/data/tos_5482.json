his browser.\nIn such a cookie, e.g.\nthe contents of a shopping cart in an online shop or a login status are saved.\nThe term \"permanent\" or \"persistent\" refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed.\nThus, e.g.\nthe login status will be saved if users visit it after several days.\nLikewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are

well as the registration, sending and statistical evaluation procedures as well as your right of objection.\nBy subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to the receipt and the procedures described.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Content of the newsletter</strong>: We send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications with advertising information (hereinafter \"newsletter\") only with the consent of the recipient or legal permission.\nInsofar as the content of a newsletter is concretely described, they are authoritative for the consent of the users.\nAmong others, our newsletter contains information about our services and us.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Double opt-in and logging</strong>: Registration for our newsletter is done in a so-called double-opt-in procedure.\nYou receive an email asking you to confirm your registration after you registered (e.g.\nat www.justetf.com/newsletter).\nThis confirmation is necessary so that nobody can register with external email addresses.\nThe registration for the newsletter will be logged in order to prove the registration process according to the legal requirements.\nThis includes saving the registration and confirmation times.\nLikewise, changes to your data stored with the newsletter service provider will be logged.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sign-up credentials</strong>: To sign up for the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your email address.\nOptionally, we ask you to give a surname and first name for a personal salutation.<br>\n<br>\nThe sending of the newsletter and the associated performance measurement are based on the consent of the recipients acc.\nArt.\n6 (1) lit.\na, Art.\n7 GDPR in combination with Art.\n7 (2) No.\n3 UWG (German law against unfair competition) or if consent is not required, based on our legitimate interests in the direct marketing acc.\nArt.\n6 (1) lt.\nf GDPR in combination with Art.\n7 (3) UWG (German law against unfair competition).<br>\n<br>\nThe logging of the registration process is based on our legitimate interests in accordance with Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nOur interest lies in the use of a user-friendly and secure newsletter system, which serves both our business interests and the expectations of the users and also allows us to prove our consent.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Termination / Revocation</strong>: You can terminate the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e.\nrevoke your consent.\nA link to cancel the newsletter can be found at the end of each newsletter.\nWe may save the email addresses for up to three years on the basis of our legitimate interests before we delete them in order to provide evidence of prior consent.\nThe processing of this data is limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims.\nAn individual request for cancellation is possible at any time, provided that at the same time the former existence of consent is confirmed.<br>\n<br>\nThe newsletter is sent by the newsletter service provider CleverReach GmbH &amp.\nCo.\nKG, M\u00fchlenstrasse 43, 26180 Rastede, Germany.\nThe privacy policy of the shipping service provider can be viewed here: https://www.cleverreach.com/de/datenschutz/.\nThe newsletter service provider is used based on our legitimate interests acc.\nArt.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR and a contract processing agreement acc.\nArt.\n28 (3) sentence 1 GDPR.<br>\n<br>\nThe newsletter service provider may use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form, i.e.\nwithout assignment to a user, to optimise or improve their own services, e.g.\nfor the technical optimisation of sending and the presentation of newsletters or for statistical purposes.\nHowever, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to address them themselves or to pass the data on to third parties.<br>\n<br>\nThe newsletters contain a so-called \"web beacon\", i.e.\na pixel-sized file that is retrieved from our server when opening the newsletter or from the server of the newsletter service provider.\nThis request will collect technical information, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval.<br>\n<br>\nThis information is used to improve the technical performance of services based on technical data or audience and their reading habits, based on their locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times.\nStatistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters are opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked.\nFor technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients.\nHowever, it is neither our goal nor that of the newsletter service provider to observe individual users.\nThe evaluations serve us much more to recognise the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.<br>\n<br>\nA separate revocation of the performance measurement is unfortunately not possible, in this case, the entire newsletter subscription must be terminated.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp.\nContact form and other forms of getting in touch with us\nWhen you contact us (e.g.\nby contact form, email, telephone or via social media), we will process the contact request based on the received data in accordance with.\nArt.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nUser information can be stored in a customer relationship management system (\"CRM System\") or comparable software.<br>\n<br>\nWe delete the requests if they are no longer required.\nWe check the necessity every six months.\nfurthermore, the legal archiving obligations apply.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp.\nParticipation in affiliate programs\nWithin our online offer, we rely on our legitimate interests (i.e., interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offering) acc.\nArt.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR industry-standard tracking measures, as far as these are necessary for the operation of the affiliate system.\nBelow we give clarification about the technical background.<br>\n<br>\nThe services offered by our contractual partners can also be advertised and linked to other websites (so-called affiliate links or after-buy systems, if, for example, links or services of third parties are offered after the conclusion of a contract).\nThe operators of the respective websites receive a commission if users follow the affiliate links and then take advantage of the offers.<br>\n<br>\nIn summary, our online offering requires us to be able to keep track of whether users who are interested in products/services advertised in our online offering through affiliate links.\nFor this, the affiliate links are supplemented by certain values that are part of the link or set otherwise, e.g.\nin a cookie.\nThe values include in particular the source website (referrer), time, an online identifier of the operator of the website on which the affiliate link was located, an online identifier of the respective offer, an online identifier of the user, as well as tracking specific values such as ad ID, affiliate ID, and categorisations.<br>\n<br>\nThe user IDs used by us are pseudonymous values.\nThe identifiers themselves do not contain personal data such as names or email addresses.\nThey only help us determine whether the same user who clicked on an affiliate link or was interested in an offer through our online offer, has signed a contract with a contractual partner.\nHowever, the online identification is personal in so far as the partner company as well as we possess other user data in combination with it.\nOnly then can the partner company tell us whether the user has taken advantage of the offer.<br>\n<br>\nAmong the affiliate systems we use are:<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp.\nAmazon affiliate program\nOn the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e.\ninterest in the economic operation of our online offer within the meaning of Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR), we are participants in the Amazon EU Affiliate Program, which was designed to

purchased a product from Amazon.<br>\n<br>\nFor more information about Amazon's data usage and opt-out options, please read the company's privacy policy:

information.<br>\n<br>\nBy submitting the application to us, the applicants agree to the processing of their data for the purposes of the application process in accordance with nature and scope set forth in this privacy policy.<br>\n<br>\nInsofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art.\n9 (1) GDPR are voluntarily communicated within the framework of the application procedure, their processing is additionally carried out in accordance with Art.\n9 (2) lit.\nb GDPR (e.g.\nhealth information such as a disability or ethnic origin).\nInsofar as special categories of personal data within the meaning of Art.\n9 (1) GDPR are requested from applicants in the context of the application procedure, their processing is additionally carried out in accordance with Art.\n9 (2) lit.\na GDPR (e.g.\nhealth data, if necessary for the profession).<br>\n<br>\nApplicants can send us their applications via email or by post.\nHowever, please note that emails are generally not sent in encrypted form and that applicants themselves must provide encryption.\nTherefore, we cannot take any responsibility for the transmission of the application between the sender and the reception on our server and therefore recommend to use the postal shipping.<br>\n<br>\nThe data provided by the applicants may be further processed by us in the event of a successful application for employment purposes.\nOtherwise, if the application for a job offer is not successful, the applicants' data will be deleted.\nApplicants' data will also be deleted if an application is withdrawn, which the applicants are entitled to at any time.<br>\n<br>\nThe deletion is subject to a legitimate revocation of the candidate, after the expiration of a period of six months, so that we can answer any follow-up questions to the application and meet our obligations under the Equal Treatment Act.\nInvoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses are archived in accordance with the tax regulations.<br>\n<br>\nIn the case of a legitimate revocation, the deletion takes place after the expiration of a period of six months, so that we can answer any follow-up questions to the application and fulfil our proof obligations under the Equal Treatment Act.\nInvoices for any reimbursement of travel expenses are archived in accordance with the tax regulations.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp.\nDisclosure of data\nBasically, a transfer of your personal data without your express prior consent only takes place in the following cases:<br>\n&nbsp.\n<ul>\n<li>If it serves investigations of illegal use of the platform or is required to pursue legal claims, personal data may be shared with law enforcement agencies and third-party victims.\nSuch transfer of data will be made only where there is specific evidence for illegal or abusive conduct.\nData may further be shared where it serves the enforcement of terms of use or other contractual agreements.\njustETF is furthermore legally obliged to disclose certain information to certain public entities upon request.\nSuch entities include law enforcement agencies that investigate administrative offences subject to fines and tax authorities.<br>\n<br> The disclosure of this data is based on our legitimate interest in the fight against abuse, the prosecution of criminal offences and the protection, assertion and enforcement of claims and that your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data do not predominate, Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n<li>We rely on contracted external companies and external service providers (\"contract processors\") to provide our services.\nIn such cases, personal data will be shared with these processors to allow them to be further processed.\nThese processors are carefully selected and regularly reviewed by us to ensure your privacy is maintained.\nThe processors may only use the data for the purposes specified by us and, in addition, contractually oblige us to treat your data exclusively in accordance with this privacy policy and German data protection laws.<br> &nbsp;</li>\n<li>As our business evolves, the structure of justETF GmbH may change, for instance by a change in legal form or creation, acquisition or sale of subsidiaries, branches or parts of a company.\nIn the course of such transactions, customer data will be transferred together with the relevant part of the company being transferred.\nIn each case of a transfer of personal data to third parties to the extent described above, justETF will ensure that such transfer is made in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection law.<br>\n<br> Any disclosure of personal data is justified by the fact that we have a legitimate interest in adapting our corporate form as required by economic and legal circumstances and do not outweigh your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data, Art.\n6 (1) lit.\nf GDPR.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp.\nChange of purpose\nProcessing of your personal data for purposes other than those described will only take place if a legal provision allows this or if you have consented to the changed purpose of the data processing.\nIn the event of further processing for purposes other than those for which the data was originally collected, we will inform you of these other purposes before further processing and provide you with all other relevant information.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp.\nDeletion of your data\nWe will delete or anonymise your personal data as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we collected or used it in accordance with the preceding paragraphs.\nAs a rule, we store your personal data for the duration of the use or contractual relationship via the website.<br>\n<br>\nWhen you delete your user account, your profile will be completely and permanently deleted.<br>\n<br>\nAfter the expiration of these periods the data will be deleted, as far as these data are not needed longer because of legal storage periods, for the criminal prosecution or for the protection, assertion or enforcement of legal claims.\nIn this case, they will be locked.\nThe data is then no longer available for further use.<br>\n<br>\n&nbsp.\nChanges to privacy policy\njustETF reserves the right to modify this privacy policy.\nThe current version of
