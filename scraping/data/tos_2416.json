information and data, we strive to apply adequate solutions to anonymize them, or at least to pseudonymize them.</p>\n<p>Our main principle applied to the data we collect is anonymization of all technical data that can be used by Bitdefender only for the specified purposes below.\nIn cases where perfect anonymization of technical data is not possible, the potential identification of a user could be possible only in very limited cases and only by highly skilled IT specialists.</p>\n<p>Personal data according to the European legislation definition (GDPR - Regulation 2016/679) means:</p>\n<p>\n<i>any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject').\nan identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>In this context, Bitdefender processes personal data for the following main purposes:</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To ensure network and information security by: <ul>\n<li>assuring correct and efficient operation of

Solutions in three different ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>directly provided by a user or a Bitdefender Partner;</li>\n<li>indirectly provided by its products or other sources, such as: <ul>\n<li>technical data sent by the Bitdefender products installed by users</li>\n<li>publicly available information from data leaks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol> 2.1.\nPersonal data directly provided by a user/partner <p>When you create an account or login in Bitdefender Central (which is mandatory to activate and manage your services), we might ask your name, surname and/or email address for management of your Bitdefender products or services and so we can contact you with updates, notices, feedback messages and other types or transactional communications or for improvement of the information security of your devices, or to provide support.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, when you download a trial version of our products, we will collect your email address, in order to have a contact method with you, to receive information such as updates, notices, feedback messages and other types or transactional communications or for improvement of the information security of your devices, or to provide support.\nWe reserve the right to verify the existence of that email address, as a security check and to prevent fraud.</p>\n<p>Also, when you access the Support Center, we may ask for a valid email address or a phone number to communicate with you in providing support..\nAll these data are being used for contacting you, for contractual purposes, providing a specific user with a license to use our products, for solving a request or complaint you addressed to us or for offering technical support.\nBitdefender may also ask for other data that could be considered personal data, if those are necessary for solving the information security problem you sought help on.\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing these data is performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.\nThe minimum data for entering into a contract or creating an account with Bitdefender are a name and email address, without them it would be impossible for us to offer you our products and services.</p>\n<p>The data used for licensing information is kept for the duration of the contract, plus five years after its expiration to be able to prove or defend any legal complaints on contractual issues.</p>\n<p>The data used for support services is kept for different periods of time, depending especially if the problem has been solved and the exact method of communication with the support services, but in no case the data will be kept for more than five years after the last communication took place.\nThis period is necessary for Bitdefender to be able to defend any legal complaints on contractual issues that may arise.</p>\n<p>As regards the use of these data for marketing purposes, the legal basis we use is legitimate interest for marketing communications with users of our Home Solutions (based on Recital 47 of GDPR and Romanian law 506/2004, art 12 (2) that is implementing the EU E-privacy directive), unless those persons have opted out.</p>\n<p>Whenever we note that we use legitimate interest as a legal basis for a specific situation, we rely on internal legal analysis on how in these specific cases we have balanced out the legitimate interest to the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\nThe analysis is updated if we decide to collect more data, for another purpose or there are new developments that require a new assessment.</p>\n<p>We may use these data for marketing purpose for a maximum period of contractual duration, plus five years after the contract is terminated, except if the data subject has opted out from these communications at any moment in time.\nAfter this time frame expires the data will be deleted or anonymized.</p> 2.2.\nTechnical data sent by Bitdefender product <p> - when you use Bitdefender products it is possible to share with us some technical details, such as data for identifying the device (UUID), the infected URL you reported or an IP addresses.\nIf you use a Bitdefender product that integrates with your email server, some technical data of the infected files could be send to us, including data such as sender, recipient, subject or attachment.\nIn most cases, these technical data may not lead to your direct or indirect identification, but in some very specific cases computer specialists might be able to identify a specific user.\nTherefore, we treat all such information as personal data and protect it as such.</p>\n<p>This information is solely used for the purpose of information and network security by correct and efficient operation of the products and services, according to the technical specifications, and their improvement, including by analyzing the reported security issues.\nThis includes delivering and customizing related services.\nAlso, we may use this information for statistical purposes and improving the quality of our products.\n</p>\n<p>The legal basis for processing these data is performance of a contract to which the data subject is part of.\n</p>\n<p>These data are is being stored for a limited period, depending on its usefulness for the current information security needs.\nBased on the current speed of technology, we will not need them for over 10 years from the day of the collection.</p> 2.3.\nCollecting Data from publicly available information (data leaks).\n<p>In the recent years, an increasing number of companies' databases have been involved in incidents leading to user details becoming publicly available.\nWe are constantly analyzing these situations and the public data leaks in order to identify if the exposed records can be used to improve the information security of our users.\n</p>\n<p>We use this information exclusively for the purpose of ensuring information security by notifying our users that their emails, passwords or other data might have been hacked in the past, so it is not safe to use them anymore.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for this collection is legitimate interest of our users, of Bitdefender and of any third party to ensure network and information security, by not using credentials that have already been hacked.\nWe do this based on Art 6 (1) f of GDPR and explanations on legitimate interest for information security in Recital 49 of GDPR.\nThese data are is being stored for a

of technology, we will not need them for over 10 years from the day of the collection.</p> 3.\nProtecting the Personal data <p>As a leader in information security services, confidentiality and data protection are of vital importance for us.\nAccess to the collected personal data is restricted only to Bitdefender employees and data processors that need access to this information.\nAll Bitdefender information security policies are ISO 27001 certified.</p>\n<p>Bitdefender may use other IT companies to process the collected personal data.\nThese companies are considered data processors and have strict contractual obligations to keep the confidentiality of the processed data and to offer at least the same level of security as Bitdefender.\nData processors have the obligation not to allow third parties to process personal data on behalf of Bitdefender and to access, use and/or keep the data secure and confidential.</p>\n<p>Bitdefender may host personal data in Romania, Ireland, as well as in European Union or any other jurisdiction, which offers adequate level of personal data protection according to European Union standards (art 45 GDPR) or other appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses (art 46.2 GDPR).</p>\n<p>Due to confidentiality obligations and security requirements, the specific information regarding the name and details for each processor used will

collection of certain Bitdefender services and products 7.1.\nAnti-theft services of Bitdefender products <p>This chapter complements the privacy policy with specific information regarding processing information which may be personal data and which is collected by Bitdefender for the anti-theft services.</p>\n<p>Part of the Bitdefender products include the anti-theft service option designed for both mobile phones products as well as for tablets and laptops.\nOnce activated and configured, the anti-theft option can track in real time via geo-localization the lost or stolen device.\nThis Bitdefender service offers the localization option as well as other connected options such as remote blocking of the device, deleting the entire content of the device or taking photos of the person who is accessing the phone without authorization.\nMore details are available here.</p>\n<p>In case the anti-theft services are activated, Bitdefender may receive personal data such as geo-localization data either from GPS, GSM cells, Wi-Fi usage or IP address.\nThe only purpose of processing these data is the functioning of the anti-theft service offered by Bitdefender.\nFor the purpose of identifying the precise location, we may use third party services, as mentioned in Chapter 3.\n</p>\n<p>All geo-localization information are kept for as long as the anti-theft service is active, but they will be deleted when the service is deactivated.</p>\n<p>Anti-theft services may be remotely activated from your Bitdefender system account (known as Bitdefender Central).\nFor this reason it is highly important for your privacy and personal data protection not to reveal your password to unauthorized persons.\nFor more advice in this regard please see Chapter 3 of this document.</p>\n<p>Thus, the owner of a Bitdefender account may have administration rights for Bitdefender services and products.\nTherefore on the devices where the anti-theft services are installed, he/she can operate commands remotely.\nIn this regard, the entire responsibility of the account owner is to ensure that he/she can fulfill these actions from a legal standpoint and that he/she has the right to know the location, to take pictures remotely, to block or delete the device' content or to interact in any way with it.\nTherefore, we recommend to activate the anti-theft service exclusively on your own devices or on devices where you have the right to legally do so.</p> 7.2.\nParental control services <p>This chapter complements the privacy policy with specific details regarding processing information which may be personal data and which are collected by Bitdefender for the Parental Control services.</p>\n<p>Some Bitdefender products include a parental control option.\nIf you buy such products or activate this option you have the possibility to monitor your children's activity and to restrict access to certain applications, websites or Internet services.\nThis is only possible on supported devices (for example computers or phones) for which you have installed and activated Bitdefender.\n</p>\n<p>The parental control services option settings are managed from the web interface through which you access your Bitdefender account (known as Bitdefender Central).\nMore details regarding the functionalities of this product are available on our dedicated webpage.</p>\n<p>Before you can activate the parental control services, Bitdefender will ask certain data for creating a profile \u2013 name, age and sex of the person.\nThe name will be used exclusively for device identification purposes and you do not have to give your child's full name.\nAge and sex are necessary only for determining the default level of online protection offered by this product, which can be also later changed or configured by the account administrator.</p>\n<p>Where this Bitdefender parental control product is installed and an active profile is associated with the device, Bitdefender may collect, exclusively for the purpose of providing parental control services, including for display in the parent\u2019s account, detailed information about the use of the device such as: visited websites, search engine keywords, used applications and software, phone contacts, and geo-localization information.</p>\n<p>The collected information depends on the settings configured by the parent in Bitdefender Central.\nThe only purpose of collecting this data is reporting to you, the parent.\nWe do not use children information for their identification or monitoring Internet access by us.</p>\n<p>We do not transmit to third parties the above mentioned information for marketing purposes or any other information which could lead to identifying your children.\n</p>\n<p>When processing this data from your children's device, Bitdefender acts as a technical intermediary.\nTherefore, the responsibility of a notice to your children regarding the installation of this software and the way the personal data is processed is exclusively up to you.\nYou are the only one who may activate this option and specify which type of personal information you wish to be collected.</p>\n<p>The Bitdefender account owner has administration rights for Bitdefender products and services which includes parental control services.\nAs such, he/she has full responsibility in assuring that he/she can undertake the surveillance activity from a legal point of view and that he/she has the right to know the location, to block the content or applications from that device.\nTherefore, we recommend to activate the parental control service exclusively on your minor children's devices or where you have the legal right to do so, based on the applicable law.\nWe inform you that any illegal monitoring of online behavior or communications may be a crime.\nWe do not recommend activating parental control services on devices used by persons who are over 16 years old, or otherwise in circumstances in which use of the parental control services is illegal.</p> 7.3.\nVPN services <p>This chapter completes the rest of the privacy policy with specific details regarding processing information which may be personal data and which are collected by Bitdefender through its VPN services.</p>\n<p>Applying the data minimization principle, we collect for this service only randomly generated or hashed user and device IDs, IP addresses and randomly generated tokens to establish VPN connection for the sole purpose of providing the VPN service.\nFor this service, we use Pango as data processor who processes data on behalf of Bitdefender in accordance with Bitdefender's instructions and for the sole purpose of providing VPN services to users.</p> 7.4

recording, screen recording, written recording, database monitoring) the Services sessions for the purposes mentioned below.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure and avoid any liability issues on our interaction with your devices, we must record all interactions for providing the Premium Services between our staff and these devices.\nWe do this specifically to protect you and/or Bitdefender or its staff for any possible mismanagement in relation with your devices or your data.\nPlease note that we may not provide the Services if you don\u2019t accept these recordings.</p>\n<p>You will be properly informed whenever we start a recording and it will always stop when we disconnect from your devices.\n</p>\n<p>The purposes of these specific data processing activities (recording the interactions between our staff and your devices) are to prevent liability issues from any contractual party for these services and to ensure services improvement, including quality assessments.</p>\n<p>The legal basis for this processing is legitimate interest of our users and of Bitdefender &amp.\nits staff, based on Art 6 (1) f of GDPR.\nThese data are being stored for a limited period \u2013 usually for maximum 12 month from the date of the communications, unless legal proceedings or liability issues are being raised on these communications in which case they will be stored until the end of such proceedings.</p> 7.5 Bitdefender BOX <p>This chapter completes the rest of the privacy policy with specific details regarding processing information which may be personal

specific information regarding processing information that may be personal data and that is collected by Bitdefender for the anti-theft services, if those are active within the Bitdefender Business Solutions that you use.\nSome of Bitdefender Business Solutions include an anti-theft service option designed for both mobile phone solutions as well as for tablets and laptops.\nOnce activated and configured, the anti-theft option can track in real time via geo-localization the lost or stolen device.\nThis Bitdefender service offers the localization option as well as other connected options such as remote blocking of the device, deleting the entire content of the device, or taking photos of the person who is accessing the phone without authorization.\nMore details are available here.\nIf

Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR), there were 554 million data losses records in the first half of 2016, alone.\nThe same report also revealed that this type of data breach is common for healthcare organizations, making up almost half (45%) of healthcare data breaches with many data losses resulted from lost or stolen devices.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Bitdefender\u2019s response: GravityZone Full-Disk Encryption</strong>\n<br>\n<br> GravityZone Full Disk Encryption is leveraging the encryption mechanisms provided by Windows (BitLocker) and Mac (FileVault), taking advantage of the native device encryption, to ensure compatibility and performance.\nThere will be no additional agent to deploy and no key management server to install.\nThe solution provides: <br>\n<br> There will be no additional agent to deploy and no key management server to install.\n</p>\n<p>The solution provides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Encryption management from the same cloud or on premise console used for endpoint protection </li>\n<li> Native encryption for Windows (BitLocker) and Mac (FileVault), avoiding performance issues with no new agent required </li>\n<li> Simple deployment of Full Disk Encryption to endpoints and management of restore keys from the console </li>\n<li>Encryption specific

attacks or zero day malware</li>\n</ul> \u2039\u203a Sandbox Analyzer <p>\n<strong>Key facts:</strong>\n<br> According to the same Verizon report, there were 1,616 social attacks in 2016, approximately half (828) of which with confirmed data disclosure.\nIn 95 percent of cases, attackers followed up a successful phish with software installation.\nThat\u2019s to be expected given most social attackers\u2019 motivations and targets.\nTwo-thirds of these actors chase after financial gain, whereas another third is in it for conducting espionage.\nBoth these motivations involve the theft of credentials, personal information, and trade secrets.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bitdefender\u2019s response</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Bitdefender\u2019s layered next-gen endpoint protection platform is designed and built from ground up to protect against elusive, advanced targeted attacks.\nSeveral layers of security provide protection both at the pre-execution (Hyperdetect, Sandbox Analyzer), on-execution (Advanced Anti-exploit and Application Control), as well as a breakthrough technology for datacenter specific protection (HVI- Hypervisor Introspection).\n</p> Enhanced visibility on data breaches <p>\n<strong>Key facts:</strong>\n<br> According to a study carried out in 2017 by Ponemon Institute on the cost of data breaches, the results showed that the average time to identify a data breach is 191 days and the average time to contain the breach is 66 days.\nIn the case of Equifax, the data breach occurred from mid-May to July 2017, was discovered at the end of July and was publicly disclosed in early September.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bitdefender\u2019s response</strong>\n<br>\n<br> Visibility is key to tackle inside threats and data breaches.\nIf discovered early enough, the efforts and related costs required to respond and mitigate internal threats resulted from data breaches could be substantially reduced.\n<br>\n<br>Bitdefender\u2019s layered next-gen endpoint protection platform was built from ground up based on the principle of adaptive security, which means that apart from the prediction, prevention and detection technologies, the security suite also includes dedicated visibility tools such as Endpoint Security HD Insight and Security Analytics for EDR </p> Endpoint Security HD Insight <ul>\n<li>It allows for remote detonation (Sandbox)</li>\n<li>It provides better context on threats</li>\n<li>It connects threats with threat actions</li>\n<li>It offers enhanced endpoint optics for future analysis and further actions </li>\n<li>It exposes suspicious threats (HD reports)</li>\n</ul> EDR Security Analytics <ul>\n<li>Events correlation and analytics automate detection and offer clear visibility into suspicious activity and indicators of compromise</li>\n<li>High fidelity detection and alert triage enables security resources to focus on real threats</li>\n<li>Incident visualization, threat investigation instruments and incident response workflows</li>\n</ul> \u2039\u203a Synopsis <p> GDPR has become a reality and soon enough all companies will need to implement the necessary steps to become compliant.\nThe process itself is complex and it involves several steps such as an assessment and gap analysis of the data privacy maturity, a detailed roadmap to address the new legislative requirements, a comprehensive map for security testing, audit and process evaluation and a continuous communication loop for constant compliance and improvement.\n</p>\n<p> However, in the center of all these initiatives, companies will need to invest in technology as the main facilitator to achieve compliance.\nGDPR is talking about defining the state-of-the-art technology attributes for managing structured and unstructured data with a strong focus on data protection and privacy.\n</p>\n<p> Through its integrated, layered next-gen security solution, Bitdefender is perfectly positioned to help companies becoming compliant by offering a set of technologies that seamlessly respond to the most rigorous GDPR requirements.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Am\u00e9rica Latina -
