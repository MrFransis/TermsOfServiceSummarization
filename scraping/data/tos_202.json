particular, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.\nIt also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>\n<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>\n<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>\n<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>\n<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.\nFor example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.\nTo build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.\nFor example, we manually review short snippets of a small sampling of voice data we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech services, such as recognition and translation.</p>\n<p>Microsoft uses the data we

these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).\nFor example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.\nHowever, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.\nFor example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both

business, meet our contractual and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data&nbsp;section of this privacy statement.\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide our products</strong>.\nWe use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nFor example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service.\nOr, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.\nAdditionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.\nFor example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.\nWe also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product improvement</strong>.\nWe use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.\nFor example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to improve speech recognition accuracy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization</strong>.\nMany products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment.\nThese features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location.\nFor example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nIf you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices.\nMany of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product activation</strong>.\nWe use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product development</strong>.\nWe use data to develop new products.\nFor example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers\u2019 computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer support</strong>.\nWe use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers\u2019 devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products, services, and training, and to investigate security incidents.\nCall recording data may also be used to authenticate or identify you based on your voice to enable Microsoft to provide support services and investigate security incidents.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>.\nWe use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.\nThis includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products.\nThis may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safety</strong>.\nWe use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers.\nOur security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.\nFor example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links.\nand we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Updates</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.\nFor example, we may use information about your device\u2019s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch.\nUpdates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and ensure your device is ready to process such updates.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Promotional communications</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to deliver promotional communications.\nYou can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.\nFor information about managing your contact data, email subscriptions, and promotional communications, see the How to access and control your personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant offers</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products.\nWe analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways.\nFor example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>.\nMicrosoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.\nWe use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.\nWe may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.\nFor more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>.\nWe use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores.\nFor example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.\nOr, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transacting commerce</strong>.\nWe use data to carry out your transactions with us.\nFor example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reporting and business operations</strong>.\nWe use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence.\nThis enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protecting rights and property</strong>.\nWe use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property.\nFor example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy.\nWe may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal compliance</strong>.\nWe process data to comply with law.\nFor example, we use the age of our customers to ensure we meet our obligations to protect children\u2019s privacy.\nWe also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Research.</strong> With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.\n</li>\n</ul>Learn moreTop of

continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.\nIn the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and

protecting the security of your personal data.\nWe use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.\nFor example, we store the personal data you provide on computer systems that have limited access and are in controlled facilities.\nWhen we transmit highly confidential data (such as a credit card number or password) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption.\nMicrosoft complies with applicable data protection laws, including applicable security breach notification laws.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Where we store and process personal dataWhere we store and process personal data<p>Personal data collected by Microsoft may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States, and in any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers operate facilities.\nMicrosoft maintains major data centers in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nTypically, the primary storage location is in the customer\u2019s region or in the United States, often with a backup to a data center in another region.\nThe storage location(s) are chosen in order to operate efficiently, to improve performance, and to create redundancies in order to protect the data in the event of an outage or other problem.\nWe take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this privacy statement is processed according to the provisions of this statement and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>\n<p>We transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to other countries, some of which have not yet been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection.\nFor example, their laws may not guarantee you the same rights, or there may not be a privacy supervisory authority there that is capable of addressing your complaints.\nWhen we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data.\nTo learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.\nMicrosoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nThe controlled U.S.\nsubsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles\u2014for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S.\nentities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy

complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.\nPlease contact us if you\u2019d like us to direct you to your data protection authority contacts.\nAs further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, binding arbitration is available

retention of personal dataOur retention of personal data<p>Microsoft retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.\nIn such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).\n(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.\nConversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>\n</ul>Top of page<i>\n</i>California Consumer Privacy ActCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act<p>If you are

productivity services and Office applications including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, among others.\nFor more details about Outlook, see the Outlook section of this privacy statement.\nMicrosoft 365 is a service that is comprised of client software applications and connected online services that span many platforms and have numerous interdependent experiences.\nVarious Microsoft 365 services enable you to use your file content for designs and recommendations, collaborate with others within your documents, and provide you functionality from other Microsoft products, such as Bing and Cortana, and third-party connected products.\nIf you work in an organization, your administrator may turn off or disable these connected services.\nYou can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.\nSee Account Privacy Settings for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Office Roaming Service</strong>.\nThe Office Roaming Service helps keep your Microsoft 365 settings up to date across your devices running Microsoft 365.\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document).\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device.\nThe Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings when you sign in to Office.com.\nWhen you sign out of Microsoft 365, the Office Roaming Service removes your Microsoft 365 settings from your device.\nAny changes you make to your customized Microsoft 365 settings are sent to Microsoft servers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Updates</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses services such as Click-to-Run or Microsoft AutoUpdate to provide you with security and other important updates.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Click-to-Run Update Service</strong>.\nThe Click-to-Run Update Service allows you to install certain Microsoft 365 products over the internet.\nThe Click-to-Run Update Service also automatically detects online updates to Click-to-Run-enabled products on your device and downloads and installs them automatically.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Translator</strong>.\nTranslator used in Office apps is designed as a no-trace connected experience.\nWith no trace, no portion of your translation request that gets sent to Microsoft Translator will be logged, your submitted text will not be used to improve the quality of the Microsoft Translator service, and there will not be any record of any portion of your data retained by Microsoft.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Diagnostic Data</strong>.\nDiagnostic data is used to (i) keep your Office apps secure and up to date.\n(ii) detect, diagnose, and remediate problems.\nand (iii) make product improvements.\nThis data does not include a user's name or email address, the content of the user's files, or information about apps unrelated to Office.\nUsers have a choice between two different levels of diagnostic data collection, Required and Optional.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Required</strong>.\nThe minimum data necessary to help keep Office apps secure, up to date, and performing as expected on the device it's installed on.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Optional</strong>.\nAdditional data that helps us make product improvements and provides enhanced information to help us detect, diagnose, and remediate issues.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> See Diagnostic Data in Office for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Connected Experiences</strong>.\nMicrosoft 365 continues to provide more experiences in client applications that are connected to and backed by cloud-based services.\nIf you choose to use connected experiences, required service data will be collected to ensure that all these connected experiences will be reliable, up to date, remain secure, and perform as expected.\nSee below for additional information about required service data.\n</p>\n<p>Microsoft 365 consists of client software applications and connected experiences designed to enable you to create, communicate, and collaborate more effectively.\nWorking with others on a document stored on OneDrive for Business or translating the contents of a Word document into a different language are examples of connected experiences.\nThere are two types of connected experiences.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Experiences that analyze your content</strong>.\nExperiences that use your Office content to provide you with design recommendations, editing suggestions, data insights, and similar features.\nFor example, PowerPoint Designer or Editor in Word.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Experiences that download online content</strong>.\nExperiences that allow you to search and download online content including templates, images, 3D models, videos, and reference materials to enhance your documents.\nFor example, templates or PowerPoint QuickStarter.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> You can access the privacy controls within your Office apps by selecting <strong>File</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Account Privacy</strong>.\nThese privacy settings allow you to configure your connected experiences.\nFor example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content.\nTurning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage.\nBut even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>\n<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.\nFor example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.\nRequired service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.\nSee Essential Services for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.\nAs you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.\nThis data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences.\nWe refer to this data as required service data.\n</p>\n<p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nIf you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.\nYour text and the translation are not stored by our service.\nRequired service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>\n<p> See Required service data for Office for more information.\n</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Microsoft TeamsMicrosoft Teams<p>This section applies to the consumer offering of

well as information about your communications, including the time and date of the communication and users that are part of the communication.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Teams profile</strong>.\nYour Teams profile includes information you provided when you set up a Microsoft account.\nTo enable other people to find you on Teams (or products that interact with Teams for personal use, including Teams for enterprise) your display name and picture are visible to other users on Teams that have your contact information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Teams contacts</strong>.\nWith your permission, Teams will sync your device contacts periodically and check for other Teams users that match contacts in your device\u2019s address book.\nYou are always in control of your contacts and can stop syncing at any time.\nIf you choose to stop syncing your device contacts, any device contacts that have not been matched during the synchronization process will be deleted from Teams.\nIf you wish to invite any of your device contacts to join a conversation, you can invite users to a 1:1 directly, or Microsoft can send an invitation on your behalf via SMS or email for invitations to group conversations.\nYou

adult from the Microsoft family group is present.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Push notifications</strong>.\nTo let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Teams uses the notification service on your device.\nFor many devices, these services are provided by another company.\nTo tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Teams has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you.\nThe company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to use the notification services for incoming

also share and collaborate on your files with others.\nSome versions of the OneDrive application enable you to access both your personal OneDrive by signing in with your personal Microsoft account and your OneDrive for Business by signing in with your work or school Microsoft account as part of your organization's use of Microsoft 365 or Office 365.</p>\n<p>When you use OneDrive, we collect data about your usage of the service, as well as the content you store, to provide, improve, and protect the services.\nExamples include indexing the contents of your OneDrive documents so that you can search for them later and using location information to enable you to search for photos based on where the photo was taken.\nWe also collect device information so we can deliver personalized experiences, such as enabling you to sync content across devices and roam customized settings.</p>\n<p>When you store content in OneDrive, that content will inherit the sharing permissions of the folder in which you store it.\nFor example, if you decide to store content in the public folder, the content will be public and available to anyone on the internet who can find the folder.\nIf you store content in a private folder, the content will be private.</p>\n<p>When you share content to a social network like Facebook from a device that you have synced with your OneDrive account, your content is either uploaded to that social network, or a link to that content is posted to that social network.\nDoing this makes the content accessible to anyone on that social network.\nTo delete the content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p>\n<p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends.\nThe link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content.\nIf one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them.\nTo revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels.\nRevoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link.\nNo one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p>\n<p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.\nOneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p>Top of

access data from the email or file storage services.</p>\n<p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device.\nIf you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application.\nIf you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers.\nAt any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p>\n<p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the

to as Bing-powered experiences).\n</p>\n<p> When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.\nFor example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft.\nAnd, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft.\nWhen you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Ask Cortana or Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Search suggestions</strong>.\nFor the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft.\nThis allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches.\nTo turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings.\nThere are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge

person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties.\nBefore we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).\nAdditionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\n</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>CortanaCortana<p>Cortana is your intelligent assistant that provides smart features and personalized experiences across a variety

and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you.\nWe also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.\n</p>\n<p> SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model.\nThis model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style.\nThe model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey\u2019s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered.\nThe model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites.\nThe SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data.\nSwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below).\nWhen you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data.\nWe use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.\n</p>\n<p> The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account.\nIf you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup.\nWhen you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data.\nAll data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.\n</p>\n<p> You may also opt in to share your language and typing data for the purposes of improving Microsoft products.\nIf you choose to do this, SwiftKey will sometimes send short snippets of data about what and how you type to our servers for processing.\nThese snippets are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements.\nTo preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these snippets will not be linked to it.\n</p>\n<p> If you sign into a SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data, Microsoft will process your language model in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our userbase.\nThis allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages.\nData used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.\n</p>\n<p> You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings.\nYou can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings.\nWhen you withdraw consent for

connectivity through a paid network.</li>\n<li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li>\n<li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li>\n<li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device.\nFor example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong> includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health.\nOptional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users.\nWhen you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.</li>\n<li>Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.\n</li>\n<li>App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.\n</li>\n<li>Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).\n</li>\n<li>Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred).\nCrash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data.\nMicrosoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample).\nBy running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your

service</strong>.\nMicrosoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.\nDepending on the capabilities of the device, the device\u2019s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely.\nWhen you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.\nThis de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.</p>\n<p>Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.\nSome features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location.\nFor information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>\n<p>When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission.\nWe will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).\nData about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.\nYou can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.\n</p>\n<p>In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location.\nYou can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>\n<p>Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.</p>\n<p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.\nIf your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location.\nLearn more about location in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General Location</strong>.\nIf you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find My Phone</strong>.\nThe Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone.\nIf you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone.\nEach time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find my device</strong>.\nThe Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.\nTo enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.\nThis feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.\nWhen the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Windows motion sensing</strong>.\nWindows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity.\nThis data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn.\nThis data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recording</strong>.\nSome Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others.\nIf you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device.\nIn some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly.\n<strong>Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication.\nThis includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance</strong>.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.</p>Top of page<i>\n</i>Security and safety featuresSecurity and safety features<p>\n<strong>Device encryption</strong>.\nDevice encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology.\nWhen device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key.\nThe BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account.\nMicrosoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>.\nThe Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update.\nMSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found.\nWhen the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device.\nDuring a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device.\nIf you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Family</strong>.\nParents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device.\nThere are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family.\nWhen Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities.\nActivity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device.\nWhen checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file.\nWhen checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device.\nIf Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device.\nWhen Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection.\nIf a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent.\nYou can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p>Top of

and a cloud-based (online) speech recognition service, in regions where Cortana is available.\nTo learn more about what languages and regions speech currently supports, see Cortana\u2019s regions and languages.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows from the software keyboard, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time in other parts of Windows.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.\nBoth device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.\nWith both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition service.\n</p>\n<p> When you use the Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition service, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data.\nThe voice data is used in the aggregate to help improve our ability to correctly recognize all users\u2019 speech.\n</p>\n<p> You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft.\nHowever, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition service provides more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition.\nWhen the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don\u2019t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition\u2014like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app\u2014will still work.\n</p>\n<p> If you\u2019ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect additional information, like your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences.\nThis additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.\n</p>\n<p> You can turn off online speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop your voice data from being sent to Microsoft.\nIf you are using a HoloLens or mixed reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop the device from listening for your voice input.\nTo control the voice data Microsoft has associated with your Microsoft account, please visit the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nWhen you turn off the online speech recognition setting, any voice data collected while you were not signed in with a Microsoft account will be disassociated from your device.\nLearn more about the online speech recognition in Windows 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Voice Activation</strong>.\nWindows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app\u2014for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond to \u201cHey Cortana.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows 10 will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords.\nOnce a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer.\nThe app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands.\nEach app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.\nMicrosoft does not collect voice recordings on behalf of any third-party apps for which you have allowed voice activation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked.\nIf enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device.\nWhen the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p>\n<p> You can turn off voice activation at any time.\nLearn more about voice activation in Windows 10.\n</p>\n<p> Even when you\u2019ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input.\nLearn more about

we use personal datamainhowweusepersonaldatamoduleSummary<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nIn particular, we use data to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide our products, which includes updating, securing, and troubleshooting, as well as providing support.\nIt also includes sharing data, when it is required to provide the service or carry out the transactions you request.</li>\n<li>Improve and develop our products.</li>\n<li>Personalize our products and make recommendations.</li>\n<li>Advertise and market to you, which includes sending promotional communications, targeting advertising, and presenting you with relevant offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also use the data to operate our business, which includes analyzing our performance, meeting our legal obligations, developing our workforce, and doing research.</p>\n<p>In carrying out these purposes, we combine data we collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products) or obtain from third parties to give you a more seamless, consistent, and personalized experience, to make informed business decisions, and for other legitimate purposes.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human) methods of processing.\nOur automated methods often are related to and supported by our manual methods.\nFor example, our automated methods include artificial intelligence (AI), which we think of as a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason, and assist in decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what people do.\nTo build, train, and improve the accuracy of our automated methods of processing (including AI), we manually review some of the predictions and inferences produced by the automated methods against the underlying data from which the predictions and inferences were made.\nFor example, we manually review short snippets of a small sampling of voice data we have taken steps to de-identify to improve our speech services, such as recognition and translation.</p>Full text<p>Microsoft uses the data we collect to provide you

collect from different contexts (for example, from your use of two Microsoft products).\nFor example Cortana may use information from your calendar to suggest action items in a heads-up email, and Microsoft Store uses information about the apps and services you use to make personalized app recommendations.\nHowever, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations where required by law.\nFor example, where required by law, we store data we collect from you when you are unauthenticated (not signed in) separately from any account information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or phone number.</p>\n<p>Our processing of personal data for these purposes includes both automated and manual (human)

and legal obligations, protect the security of our systems and our customers, or fulfill other legitimate interests of Microsoft as described in this section and in the Reasons we share personal data&nbsp;section of this privacy statement.\nWhen we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, we do so based on a variety of legal mechanisms, as described in the Where we store and process personal data section of this privacy statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>More on the purposes of processing:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Provide our products</strong>.\nWe use data to operate our products and provide you with rich, interactive experiences.\nFor example, if you use OneDrive, we process the documents you upload to OneDrive to enable you to retrieve, delete, edit, forward, or otherwise process it, at your direction as part of the service.\nOr, for example, if you enter a search query in the Bing search engine, we use that query to display search results to you.\nAdditionally, as communications are a feature of various products, programs, and activities, we use data to contact you.\nFor example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means to inform you when a subscription is ending or discuss your licensing account.\nWe also communicate with you to secure our products, for example by letting you know when product updates are available.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product improvement</strong>.\nWe use data to continually improve our products, including adding new features or capabilities.\nFor example, we use error reports to improve security features, search queries and clicks in Bing to improve the relevancy of the search results, usage data to determine what new features to prioritize, and voice data to improve speech recognition accuracy.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization</strong>.\nMany products include personalized features, such as recommendations that enhance your productivity and enjoyment.\nThese features use automated processes to tailor your product experiences based on the data we have about you, such as inferences we make about you and your use of the product, activities, interests, and location.\nFor example, depending on your settings, if you stream movies in a browser on your Windows device, you may see a recommendation for an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nIf you have a Microsoft account, with your permission, we can sync your settings on several devices.\nMany of our products provide controls to disable personalized features.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product activation</strong>.\nWe use data\u2014such as device and application type, location, and unique device, application, network, and subscription identifiers\u2014to activate products that require activation.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Product development</strong>.\nWe use data to develop new products.\nFor example, we use data, often de-identified, to better understand our customers\u2019 computing and productivity needs which can shape the development of new products.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer support</strong>.\nWe use data to troubleshoot and diagnose product problems, repair customers\u2019 devices, and provide other customer care and support services, including to help us provide, improve, and secure the quality of our products,

and investigate security incidents.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Help secure and troubleshoot</strong>.\nWe use data to help secure and troubleshoot our products.\nThis includes using data to protect the security and safety of our products and customers, detecting malware and malicious activities, troubleshooting performance and compatibility issues to help customers get the most out of their experiences, and notifying customers of updates to our products.\nThis may include using automated systems to detect security and safety issues.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safety</strong>.\nWe use data to protect the safety of our products and our customers.\nOur security features and products can disrupt the operation of malicious software and notify users if malicious software is found on their devices.\nFor example, some of our products, such as Outlook or OneDrive, systematically scan content in an automated manner to identify suspected spam, viruses, abusive actions, or URLs that have been flagged as fraud, phishing, or malware links.\nand we reserve the right to block delivery of a communication or remove content if it violates our terms.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Updates</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to develop product updates and security patches.\nFor example, we may use information about your device\u2019s capabilities, such as available memory, to provide you a software update or security patch.\nUpdates and patches are intended to maximize your experience with our products, help you protect the privacy and security of your data, provide new features, and ensure your device is ready to process such updates.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Promotional communications</strong>.\nWe use data we collect to deliver promotional communications.\nYou can sign up for email subscriptions and choose whether you wish to receive promotional communications from Microsoft by email, SMS, physical mail, and telephone.\nFor information

statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Relevant offers</strong>.\nMicrosoft uses data to provide you with relevant and valuable information regarding our products.\nWe analyze data from a variety of sources to predict the information that will be most interesting and relevant to you and deliver such information to you in a variety of ways.\nFor example, we may predict your interest in gaming and communicate with you about new games you may like.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising</strong>.\nMicrosoft does not use what you say in email, chat, video calls, or voice mail, or your documents, photos, or other personal files to target ads to you.\nWe use data we collect through our interactions with you, through some of our products, and on third-party web properties, for advertising in our products and on third-party properties.\nWe may use automated processes to help make advertising more relevant to you.\nFor more information about how your data is used for advertising, see the Advertising section of this privacy statement.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Prize promotions and events</strong>.\nWe use your data to administer prize promotions and events available in our physical Microsoft Stores.\nFor example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data to select a winner and provide the prize to you if you win.\nOr, if you register for a coding workshop or gaming event, we will add your name to the list of expected attendees.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transacting commerce</strong>.\nWe use data to carry out your transactions with us.\nFor example, we process payment information to provide customers with product subscriptions and use contact information to deliver goods purchased from the Microsoft Store.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Reporting and business operations</strong>.\nWe use data to analyze our operations and perform business intelligence.\nThis enables us to make informed decisions and report on the performance of our business.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Protecting rights and property</strong>.\nWe use data to detect and prevent fraud, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and protect our property.\nFor example, we use data to confirm the validity of software licenses to reduce piracy.\nWe may use automated processes to detect and prevent activities that violate our rights and the rights of others, such as fraud.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Legal compliance</strong>.\nWe process data to comply with law.\nFor example, we use the age of our customers to ensure we meet our obligations to protect children\u2019s privacy.\nWe also process contact information and credentials to help customers exercise their data protection rights.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Research.</strong> With appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms, we use data to conduct research, including for public interest and scientific purposes.\n</li>\n</ul>Reasons we share

advertising that appears in apps on Windows, you may use the opt-out linked to your personal Microsoft account, or opt out of interest-based advertising by turning off the advertising ID in Windows settings.</p>\n<p>Because the data used for interest-based advertising is also used for other required purposes (including providing our products, analytics, and fraud detection), opting out of interest-based advertising does not stop that data collection.\nYou will continue to get ads, although they may be less relevant to you.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising

Tracking Protection in Internet Explorer (versions 9 and up) and Microsoft Edge.\nThis feature will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed in a Tracking Protection List you add.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser controls for \"Do Not Track.\"</strong> Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nBecause there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, Microsoft services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.\nWe continue to work with the online industry to define a common understanding of how to treat DNT signals.\nIn the meantime, you can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from Microsoft as described above.</li>\n</ul>Cookies and similar technologiesCookies and similar

is capable of addressing your complaints.\nWhen we engage in such transfers, we use a variety of legal mechanisms, including contracts, to help ensure your rights and protections travel with your data.\nTo learn more about the European Commission\u2019s decisions on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in the countries where Microsoft processes personal data, see this article on the European Commission website.</p>\n<p>Microsoft Corporation complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States, although Microsoft does not rely on the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18.\nMicrosoft Corporation has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nIf third-party agents process personal data on our behalf in a manner inconsistent with the principles of either Privacy Shield framework, we remain liable unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.\nThe controlled U.S.\nsubsidiaries of Microsoft Corporation, as identified in our self-certification submission, also adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles\u2014for more info, see the list of Microsoft U.S.\nentities or subsidiaries adhering to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy

Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, we encourage you to contact us via our web form.\nFor any complaints related to the Privacy Shield frameworks that Microsoft cannot resolve directly, we have chosen to cooperate with the relevant EU Data Protection Authority, or a panel established by the European data protection authorities, for resolving disputes with EU individuals, and with the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) for resolving disputes with Swiss individuals.\nPlease contact us if you\u2019d like us to direct you to your data protection authority

retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide the products and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different data types, the context of our interactions with you or your use of products, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Other criteria used to determine the retention periods include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Do customers provide, create, or maintain the data with the expectation we will retain it until they affirmatively remove it?</strong> Examples include a document you store in OneDrive, or an email message you keep in your Outlook.com inbox.\nIn such cases, we would aim to maintain the data until you actively delete it, such as by moving an email from your Outlook.com inbox to the Deleted Items folder, and then emptying that folder (when your Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion).\n(Note that there may be other reasons why the data has to be deleted sooner, for example if you exceed limits on how much data can be stored in your account.)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is there an automated control, such as in the Microsoft privacy dashboard, that enables the customer to access and delete the personal data at any time?</strong> If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is the personal data of a sensitive type?</strong> If so, a shortened retention time would generally be adopted.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has Microsoft adopted and announced a specific retention period for a certain data type?</strong> For example, for Bing search queries, we de-identify stored queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period?</strong> If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Is Microsoft subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain or delete the data?</strong> Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data retained for the purposes of litigation.\nConversely, if we are required by law to remove unlawful content, we will do so.</li>\n</ul>California Consumer Privacy ActCalifornia Consumer Privacy ActmaincaliforniaconsumerprivacyactmoduleSummary<p>If you are a California resident, we process your personal data in

Microsoft 365.\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 with your Microsoft account or an account issued by your organization, the Office Client Policy Service is turned on and syncs some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings to Microsoft servers (such as a list of most recently used documents and the last location viewed within a document).\nWhen you sign in to Microsoft 365 on another device with the same account, the Office Roaming Service downloads your settings from Microsoft servers and applies them to the additional device.\nThe Office Roaming Service also applies some of your customized Microsoft 365 settings when you sign in to Office.com.\nWhen you sign out of Microsoft 365, the Office Roaming Service removes your Microsoft 365 settings from your device.\nAny changes you make to

configure your connected experiences.\nFor example, you can choose to enable connected experiences that download online content, but not connected experiences that analyze content.\nTurning off connected experiences will also turn off additional experiences, such as document co-authoring and online file storage.\nBut even if you use this privacy setting to turn off connected experiences, certain functionality will remain available, such as syncing your mailbox in Outlook, as well as essential services described below.\n</p>\n<p>If you choose to disable certain types of connected experiences, either the ribbon or menu command for those connected experiences will be grayed out or you will get an error message when you try to use those connected experiences.</p>\n<p> There are a set of services that are essential to how Microsoft 365 functions and cannot be disabled.\nFor example, the licensing service that confirms that you are properly licensed to use Microsoft 365 is essential.\nRequired service data about these services is collected and sent to Microsoft, regardless of any other settings that you have configured.\nSee Essential Services for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required service data for connected experiences</strong>.\nAs you use a connected experience, data is sent to and processed by Microsoft to provide you that connected experience.\nThis data is necessary because this information enables us to deliver these cloud-based connected experiences.\nWe refer to this data as required service data.\n</p>\n<p>Required service data can include information related to the operation of the connected experience that is needed to keep the underlying service secure, up to date, and performing as expected.\nIf you choose to use a connected experience that analyzes your content, for example Translate in Word, the text you typed and selected to translate is also sent and processed to provide you the connected experience.\nYour text and the translation are not stored by our service.\nRequired service data can also include information needed by a connected experience to perform its task, such as configuration information about the Office app.</p>\n<p> See Required service data for Office for more information.\n</p>Microsoft TeamsMicrosoft TeamsmainteamsmoduleSummary<p>This section applies to the consumer offering of

content, you need to delete it from the social network (if it was uploaded there, rather than a link to it) and from OneDrive.</p>\n<p>When you share your OneDrive content with your friends via a link, an email with the link is sent to those friends.\nThe link contains an authorization code that allows anyone with the link to access your content.\nIf one of your friends sends the link to other people, they will also be able to access your content, even if you did not choose to share the content with them.\nTo revoke permissions for your content on OneDrive, sign in to your account and then select the specific content to manage the permission levels.\nRevoking permissions for a link effectively deactivates the link.\nNo one will be able to use the link to access the content unless you decide to share the link again.</p>\n<p>Files managed with OneDrive for Business are stored separately from files stored with your personal OneDrive.\nOneDrive for Business collects and transmits personal data for authentication, such as your email address and password, which will be transmitted to Microsoft and/or to the provider of your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 service.</p>OutlookOutlookmainoutlookmoduleSummary<p>Outlook products are designed to improve your productivity through improved communications and include Outlook.com, Outlook applications, and related services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Outlook.com</strong>.\nOutlook.com is the primary consumer email service from Microsoft and includes email accounts with addresses that end in outlook.com, live.com, hotmail.com, and msn.com.\nOutlook.com provides features that let you connect with your friends on social networks.\nYou will need to create a Microsoft account to use Outlook.com.</p>\n<p>When you delete an email or item from a mailbox in Outlook.com, the item generally goes into your Deleted Items folder where it remains for approximately 7 days unless you move it back to your inbox, you empty the folder, or the service empties the folder automatically, whichever comes first.\nWhen the Deleted Items folder is emptied, those emptied items remain in our system for up to 30 days before final deletion, unless we are legally required to retain the data for longer.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Outlook applications</strong>.\nOutlook client applications are software you install on your device that permits you to manage email, calendar items, files, contacts, and other data from email, file storage, and other services, like Exchange Online or Outlook.com, or servers, like Microsoft Exchange.\nYou can use multiple accounts from different providers, including third-party providers, with Outlook applications.</p>\n<p>To add an account, you must provide permission for Outlook to access data from the email or file storage services.</p>\n<p>When you add an account to Outlook, your mail, calendar items, files, contacts, settings and other data from that account will automatically sync to your device.\nIf you are using the mobile Outlook application, that data will also sync to Microsoft servers to enable additional features such as faster search, personalized filtering of less important mail, and an ability to add email attachments from linked file storage providers without leaving the Outlook application.\nIf you are using the desktop Outlook application, you can choose whether to allow the data to sync to our servers.\nAt any time, you can remove an account or make changes to the data that is synced from your account.</p>\n<p>If you add an account provided by an organization (such as your employer or school), the owner of the organizational domain can implement policies and controls (for example, requiring multi-factor authentication or the ability to remotely wipe data from your device) that can affect your use of Outlook.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the data the Outlook applications collect and process, please see the Microsoft 365 section of this privacy statement.</p>SkypeSkypemainskypemoduleSummary<p> Skype lets you send and receive voice, video, SMS, and instant message communications.\nThis section applies to the consumer

know to your Skype contact list until you tell the application to stop.\nWith your permission, Skype will also check your device to automatically add your friends as Skype contacts.\nYou can block users if you don\u2019t want to receive their communications.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Partner companies</strong>.\nTo make Skype available to more people, we partner with other companies to allow Skype to be offered via those companies\u2019 services.\nIf you use Skype through a company other than Microsoft, that company\u2019s privacy policy governs how it handles your data.\nTo comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, or to help our partner company or local operator comply or respond, we may access, transfer, disclose, and preserve your data.\nThat data could include, for example, your private content, such as the content of your instant messages, stored video messages, voicemails, or file transfers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Skype Manager</strong>.\nSkype Manager lets you manage a group\u2019s (such as your family\u2019s) Skype usage from one central place.\nWhen you set up a group, you will be the Skype Manager Administrator and can see the patterns of usage, including detailed information, like traffic data and details of purchases, of other members of the group who have consented to such access.\nIf you add information like your name, other people in the group will be able to see it.\nMembers of the group can withdraw consent for Skype Manager by visiting their Skype account page.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Push notifications</strong>.\nTo let you know of incoming calls, chats, and other messages, Skype apps use the notification service on your device.\nFor many devices, these services are provided by another company.\nTo tell you who is calling, for example, or to give you the first few words of the new chat, Skype has to tell the notification service so that they can provide the notification to you.\nThe company providing the notification service on your device will use this information in accordance with their own terms and privacy policy.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for the data collected by the company providing the notification service.\nIf you don\u2019t want to use the notification services for incoming Skype calls and messages, turn it off in the settings found in the Skype application or your device.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Translation features</strong>.\nWhen you use Skype\u2019s translation features, Skype collects and uses your conversation to provide the translation service.\nWith your

analyzed and any corrections are entered into our system, to build better performing services.\n<strong>This data may include transcription of audio recordings by Microsoft employees and vendors</strong>, subject to procedures designed to protect users\u2019 privacy, including taking steps to de-identify data, requiring non-disclosure agreements with vendors and their employees, and requiring that vendors meet the high privacy standards.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recording features</strong>.\nSome versions of Skype have a recording feature that allows you to capture and share all or part of your audio / video call.\nThe recording will be stored and shared as part of your conversation history with the person or group with whom the call occurred.\n<strong>You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording any communication.\nThis includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance</strong>.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for how you use your recordings or the recording features.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Skype bots</strong>.\nBots are programs offered by Microsoft or third parties that can do many useful things like search for news, play games, and more.\nDepending on their capabilities, bots may have access to your display name, Skype ID, country, region, language, and any messages, audio, video, or content that you share with the bot.\nPlease review the bot profile and its privacy statement before engaging in a one-to-one or group conversation with a bot.\nYou can delete a bot that you no longer wish to engage with.\nPrior to adding a bot to a group, please ensure that your group participants have consented to their information being shared with the bot.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Captioning</strong>.\nCertain Skype features include accessibility functionality such as captioning.\nDuring Skype calls, a call participant can activate a voice-to-text feature, which allows the user to view the audio chat as text.\nIf a user activates this feature, other call participants will not receive a notification.\nMicrosoft uses this voice and text data to provide captioning of audio for users.\n</p>Surface

over time.</p>BingBingmainbingmoduleSummary<p> Bing services include search and mapping services, as well as the Bing Toolbar and Bing Desktop apps.\nBing services collect and process data in many forms, including text that has been inked or typed, speech data, and images.\nBing services are also included within other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365, Cortana, and certain features in Windows (which we refer to as Bing-powered experiences).\n</p>\n<p> When you conduct a search, or use a feature of a Bing-powered experience that involves conducting a search or entering a command on your behalf, Microsoft will collect the searches or commands you provide (which may be in the form of text, voice data, or an image), along with your IP address, location, the unique identifiers contained in our cookies or similar technologies, the time and date of your search, and your browser configuration.\nFor example, if you use Bing voice-enabled services, your voice input and performance data associated with the speech functionality will be sent to Microsoft.\nAnd, if you use Bing image-enabled services, the image you provide will be sent to Microsoft.\nWhen you use Bing-powered experiences, such as Ask Cortana or Bing Lookup to search a particular word or phrase within a webpage or document, that word or phrase is sent to Bing along with some surrounding content in order to provide contextually relevant search results.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Search suggestions</strong>.\nFor the search suggestions feature, the characters that you type into a Bing-powered experience (such as search and site suggestions in the Microsoft Edge browser) to conduct a search and what you click on will be sent to Microsoft.\nThis allows us to provide you with relevant suggestions as you type your searches.\nTo turn this feature on or off, while using Bing Search, go to Bing Settings.\nThere are other methods to control this feature in other Bing-powered experiences, such as the Microsoft Edge browser.\nSearch Suggestions cannot be turned off in the Windows 10 search box.\nOn Windows, you can always hide the search box so as not to use the feature.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bing experience improvement program for Bing Desktop and Bing Toolbar</strong>.\nIf you are using Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar and choose to participate in the Bing Experience Improvement Program, we also collect additional data about how you use these specific Bing apps, such as the addresses of the websites you visit, to help improve search ranking and relevance.\nTo help protect your privacy, we do not use the data collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program to identify or contact you or target advertising to you.\nYou can turn off the Bing Experience Improvement Program at any time in the Bing Desktop or Bing Toolbar settings.\nFinally, we delete the information collected through the Bing Experience Improvement Program after 18 months.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Retention and de-identification</strong>.\nWe de-identify stored search queries by removing the entirety of the IP address after 6 months, and cookie IDs and other cross-session identifiers that are used to identify a particular account or device after 18 months.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personalization through Microsoft account</strong>.\nSome Bing services provide you with an enhanced experience when you sign in with your personal Microsoft account, for example, syncing your search history across devices.\nYou can use these personalization features to customize your interests, favorites, and settings, and to connect your account with third-party services.\nVisit Bing Settings to manage your personalization settings, or the Microsoft privacy dashboard to manage your data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Managing search history</strong>.\nWhen you\u2019re signed-in to a personal Microsoft account, you can erase your search history on the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nThe Search History service from Bing, located in Bing Settings, provides another method of revisiting the search terms you've entered and results you've clicked when using Bing search through your browser.\nYou may clear your search history on a device through this service.\nClearing your history prevents that history from being displayed on the Search History site, but does not delete information from our search logs, which are retained and de-identified as described above or as you have instructed through the privacy dashboard.\nIf you are signed-in to a work or school Microsoft account using Microsoft Search in Bing, you can export your Microsoft Search in Bing search history, but you cannot delete it.\nYour Microsoft Search in Bing service administrator can see aggregated search history across all enterprise users but cannot see specific searches by user.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party services that use Bing</strong>.\nYou may access Bing-powered experiences when using third-party services, such as those from Yahoo!.\nIn order to provide these services, Bing receives data from these and other partners, including your search query and related data (such as date, time, IP address, and a unique identifier).\nThis data will be sent to Microsoft to provide the search service.\nMicrosoft will use this data as described in this statement or as further limited by our contractual obligations with our partners.\nYou should refer to the privacy policies of the third-party services for any questions about how they collect and use data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Data passed to destination website</strong>.\nWhen you select a search result or advertisement from a Bing search results page and go to the destination website, the destination website will receive the standard data your browser sends to every web site you visit\u2014such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the host name of the site you came from (in this case, https://www.bing.com/).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing data from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with third parties</strong>.\nWe share some de-identified data (data where the identity of a specific person is not known) from Bing and Bing-powered experiences with selected third parties.\nBefore we do so, we run the data through a process designed to remove certain sensitive data that users may have included in the search terms themselves (such as social security numbers or credit card numbers).\nAdditionally, we require these third parties to keep the data secure and to not use the data for purposes other than for which it is provided.\n</p>CortanaCortanamaincortanamoduleSummary<p>Cortana is your intelligent assistant that provides smart features and personalized experiences across a variety of devices, apps, and services.\nAs described below, the data we collect when you use Cortana depends on the choices you make (including your privacy settings and whether

Cortana can access data about your device and how you use it.\nFor instance, Cortana can determine if Bluetooth is on, whether you\u2019ve locked your screen, your alarm settings, and which apps you install and use.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you sign in with your Microsoft account, you can enable Cortana to perform additional tasks and to provide personalized experiences and suggestions.\nCortana can process the demographic data (such as your age, address, and gender) associated with your Microsoft account and data collected through other Microsoft services to provide personalized suggestions.\nFor example, Cortana may send you a time to leave notification based on your schedule and address.\nCortana also learns your favorite places from the Microsoft Maps app, and what you view and purchase in Microsoft Store to improve suggestions.\nYour interests in the Cortana Notebook can be used by other Microsoft services, such as Bing or MSN, to customize your interests, preferences, and favorites in those experiences as well.</p>\n<p>When you sign in to Cortana, in addition to the information described above, we also collect:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Location data</strong>.\nYou can choose whether Cortana processes your location information to give you relevant notices and results and to make suggestions such as local traffic information and location-based reminders.\nIf you grant permission, Cortana will regularly collect and use your current location, location history, and other location signals (such as locations tagged on photos you upload to OneDrive).\nLocation data Cortana collects is used to provide you with personalized experiences across our products, such as making Bing search results more relevant.\nIt may also be used in de-identified form to improve Microsoft\u2019s location services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contacts, communications, and other inputs</strong>.\nYou can choose to let Cortana collect and access your device and cloud-based email and other communications, your calendar and tasks, and your contacts to enable additional features and personalization.\nIf you give permission, Cortana will collect and process additional data, including:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Contacts, text messages, and email</strong>.\nCortana uses your contacts and messages to do a variety of things, such as: making calls in the Teams app, allowing you to add events to your calendar, apprising you of messages or important contacts, and keeping you up to date on events and important activities.\nCortana also uses your contacts and messages to help you with planning and offers other suggestions.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communications history</strong>.\nCortana learns who is most important to you and your preferred methods of communication by analyzing your call, text message, and email history.\nCortana uses this data to flag important messages for you (such as missed calls), and to improve the performance of features such as speech recognition.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Calendar appointments</strong>.\nCortana uses your calendars to provide reminders and information relevant to your appointments.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Browse history</strong>.\nIf you choose, Cortana can use the Microsoft Edge browse history associated with your Microsoft account.\nCortana uses this data to learn about you and provide you with intelligent answers and timely, personalized suggestions, or to complete web tasks for you.\nCortana can also help you pick up where you left off on one device when browsing in Microsoft Edge on another device.\nCortana won\u2019t collect information about sites you visit in InPrivate tabs.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Connected services and skills</strong>.\nTo enable greater personalization and productivity, you can give Cortana permission to (i) collect data from other Microsoft and third-party services, and (ii) provide your information to those services.\nWhen enabled, Cortana provides your requests and responses to those services or third parties to enable them to provide you their information or services.\nWith your permission, Cortana can send additional information (e.g., your location).\nInformation you share with a third party is governed by the third party\u2019s privacy policy and terms.\nCortana also uses data about your use of connected services and skills to improve and develop Cortana and other Microsoft products.\nFor example, we use this data, including your query sent to the third party, to improve speech recognition and user-intent understanding within Microsoft products.\nBelow are examples of how your data is processed when you use connected services and skills:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose to connect Cortana to your work or school account, Cortana can access data stored in Microsoft 365 to help you stay up to date, manage your email and calendar, and get insights about your meetings and relationships.</li>\n<li>Choosing to connect Cortana to LinkedIn allows Microsoft to access your LinkedIn data so Cortana can give you more personalized information and recommendations.\nIt also enables LinkedIn to access the name, email address, job title, and company name of people you are meeting with to retrieve relevant information about those contacts.</li>\n<li> Cortana allows you to connect to third-party services to do more and get additional experiences from the third-party service.\nCortana may also personalize your experiences based on your use of third-party skills.\nWith your permission, <strong>Cortana can send information about you along with your request to third-parties that ask for it</strong>.\nFor instance, when you ask Cortana to request you a ride, the ride provider will ask for your current location.\nThird-party skills provide their own separate terms and privacy statements.\nPlease review those carefully before allowing Cortana to send information to them.\n</li>\n</ul>Microsoft EdgeMicrosoft EdgemainmsedgemoduleSummary<p>Whenever you use a web browser to access the internet, data about your device (\"standard device data\") is sent to the websites you visit and online services you use.\nStandard device data includes your device's IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring website addresses.\nThis data might be

you use and how you type and use this data to learn your writing style and provide personalized autocorrection and predictive text that adapts to you.\nWe also use this data to offer a range of other features, such as hashtag and emoji predictions.\n</p>\n<p> SwiftKey prediction technology learns from the way you use language to build a personalized language model.\nThis model is an optimized view of the words and phrases that you use most often in context and reflects your unique writing style.\nThe model itself contains the words you commonly type arranged in a way that enables SwiftKey\u2019s algorithms to make predictions, based on text you have already entered.\nThe model draws from all scenarios in which you use your keyboard, including when you type while using apps or visiting websites.\nThe SwiftKey keyboard and model attempt to avoid collecting sensitive data, by not collecting data from certain fields such as those recognized as containing password or payment data.\nSwiftKey Services do not log, store, or learn from data you type, or the data contained in your model, unless you choose to share your data with us (as described further below).\nWhen you use SwiftKey Services, we also collect device and usage data.\nWe use de-identified device and usage data to analyze service performance and help improve our products.\n</p>\n<p> The SwiftKey Services also include an optional cloud component called a SwiftKey Account.\nIf you choose to create a SwiftKey Account, your language model will be synced with the SwiftKey Account cloud service, so you can benefit from that model on the different devices you use and access additional services such as prediction synchronization and backup.\nWhen you create a SwiftKey Account, Microsoft will also collect your email address and basic demographic data.\nAll data collected is transferred to our servers over encrypted channels.\n</p>\n<p> You may also opt in to share your language and typing data for the purposes of improving Microsoft products.\nIf you choose to do this, SwiftKey will sometimes send short snippets of data about what and how you type to our servers for processing.\nThese snippets are used in various automated processes to validate that our prediction services are working correctly and to make product improvements.\nTo preserve your privacy, SwiftKey Services de-identify these snippets, and even if you have a SwiftKey Account, these snippets will not be linked to it.\n</p>\n<p> If you sign into a SwiftKey Account and opt to share your language and typing data, Microsoft will process your language model in order to look for new patterns of language usage across our userbase.\nThis allows us to improve our basic models for individual languages.\nData used in this process is aggregated and any words or combinations of words that might be personal to individuals or small groups of users are filtered out.\n</p>\n<p> You can withdraw your consent to share your language and typing data for product improvement at any time in SwiftKey Settings.\nYou can also withdraw your consent for SwiftKey Services to retain your personal data in SwiftKey Settings.\nWhen you withdraw consent for SwiftKey to retain your personal data, all personal data collected through your use of the SwiftKey Services will be deleted.\n</p>\n<p> You may receive occasional notifications on your device alerting you to product updates and features that may be of interest to you.\nYou can disable these notifications at any time in the SwiftKey Settings.\n</p>WindowsWindowsmainwindowsmoduleSummary<p>Windows is a personalized computing environment that enables you to seamlessly roam and access services, preferences, and content across your computing devices from phones to tablets to the Surface Hub.\nRather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based, and both cloud and local elements of Windows are updated regularly, providing you with the latest improvements and features.\nIn order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows.\nAnd because Windows is personal to you, we give you choices about the personal data we collect and how we use it.\nNote that if your Windows device is managed by your organization (such as your employer or school), your organization may use centralized management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data and to control device settings (including privacy settings), device policies, software updates, data collection by us or the organization, or other aspects of your device.\nAdditionally, your organization may use management tools provided by Microsoft or others to access and process your data from that device, including your interaction data, diagnostic data, and the contents of your communications and files.\nFor more information about data collection and privacy in Windows, see Windows 10 and your online services.\nEarlier versions of Windows (including Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1) are subject to their own privacy statements.</p>ActivationActivationmainactivationmoduleSummary<p>When you activate Windows, a specific product key is associated with the device on which your software is installed.\nThe product key and data about the software and your device is sent to Microsoft to help validate your license to the software.\nThis data may be sent again if there is a need to re-activate or validate your license.\nOn phones running Windows, device and network identifiers, as well as device location at the time of the first power-up of the device, are also sent to Microsoft for the purpose of warranty registration, stock replenishment, and fraud prevention.</p>Activity historyActivity historymainactivityhistorymoduleSummary<p>Activity history helps keep track of the things you do on your device, such as the apps and services you use, the files you open, and the websites you browse.\nYour activity history is stored locally on your device when using different apps and features such as Microsoft Edge, some Microsoft Store apps, and Microsoft 365 apps.\nIf you've signed in to your device with a Microsoft account and given your permission, Windows sends your activity history to Microsoft.\nOnce your activity history is in the cloud, Microsoft uses that data to enable cross-device experiences, to provide you with the ability to continue those activities on other devices, to provide personalized experiences (such as ordering your activities based on duration of use) and relevant suggestions (such as anticipating what your needs might be based on your activity history), and to help improve Microsoft products.</p>\n<p>Activity history is also created and sent to Microsoft when you use Microsoft apps, such as Microsoft Edge, and Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on mobile devices such as iOS and Android phones and tablets.\nIf you are signed in with your Microsoft account, you can continue activities on your Windows&nbsp;10 device that you started in Microsoft apps on your Android or iOS device.\nYou can turn settings off or on for sending your activity history to Microsoft and storing activity history locally on your device, and you can also clear your device\u2019s activity history at any time by going to Start &gt.\nSettings &gt.\nPrivacy &gt.\nActivity history.\nLearn more about activity history in Windows 10.</p>Advertising IDAdvertising IDmainadvertisingidmoduleSummary<p>Windows generates a unique advertising ID for each person using a device, which app developers and advertising networks can then use for their own purposes, including providing relevant advertising in apps.\nWhen the advertising ID is enabled, both Microsoft apps and third-party apps can access and use the advertising ID in much the same way that websites can access and use a unique identifier stored in a cookie.\nThus, your advertising ID can be used by app developers and advertising networks to provide more relevant advertising and other personalized experiences across their apps and on the web.\nMicrosoft collects the advertising ID for the uses described here only when you choose to enable the advertising ID as part of your privacy setting.</p>\n<p>The advertising ID setting applies to Windows apps using the Windows advertising identifier.\nYou can turn off access to this identifier at any time by turning off the advertising ID in Settings.\nIf you choose to turn it on again, the advertising ID will be reset and a new identifier will be generated.\nWhen a third-party app accesses the advertising ID, its use of the advertising ID will be subject to its own privacy policy.\nLearn more about advertising ID in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>The advertising ID setting does not apply to other methods of interest-based advertising delivered by Microsoft or third parties, such as cookies used to provide interest-based display ads on websites.\nThird-party products accessed through or installed on Windows may also deliver other forms of interest-based advertising subject to their own privacy policies.\nMicrosoft delivers other forms of interest-based ads in certain Microsoft products, both directly and by partnering with third-party ad providers.\nFor more information on how Microsoft uses data for advertising, see the How we use personal data section of this statement.</p>DiagnosticsDiagnosticsmaindiagnosticsmoduleSummary<p>Microsoft collects Windows diagnostic data to solve problems and to keep Windows up to date, secure, and operating properly.\nIt also helps us improve Windows and related Microsoft products and services and, for customers who have turned on the \u201cTailored experiences\u201d setting, to provide more relevant tips and recommendations to tailor Microsoft and third-party products and services for Windows to the customer\u2019s needs.\nThis data is transmitted to Microsoft and stored with one or more unique identifiers that can help us recognize an individual user on an individual device and understand the device's service issues and use patterns.</p>\n<p>There are two levels of diagnostic and activity data: Required diagnostic data and Optional diagnostic data.\nCertain product documentation and other materials refer to Required diagnostic data as Basic diagnostic data and to Optional diagnostic data as Full diagnostic data.</p>\n<p>If an organization (such as your employer or school) uses Microsoft management tools or engages Microsoft to manage your device, we and the organization will use and process diagnostic and error data from your device to allow the management, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the organization's devices, and for other purposes of the organization.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> includes information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.\nWe collect the following Required diagnostic data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Device, connectivity, and configuration data: <ul>\n<li>Data about the device such as the processor type, OEM manufacturer, type of battery and capacity, number and type of cameras, firmware, and memory attributes.</li>\n<li>Network capabilities and connection data such as the device\u2019s IP address, mobile network (including IMEI and mobile operator), and whether the device is connected to a free or paid network.</li>\n<li>Data about the operating system and its configuration such as the OS version and build number, region and language settings, diagnostics data settings, and whether the device is part of the Windows Insider program.</li>\n<li>Data about connected peripherals such as model, manufacturer, drivers, and compatibility data.</li>\n<li>Data about the applications installed on the device such as application name, version, and publisher.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Whether a device is ready for an update and whether there are factors that may impede the ability to receive updates, such as low battery, limited disk space, or connectivity through a paid network.</li>\n<li>Whether updates complete successfully or fail.</li>\n<li>Data about the reliability of the diagnostics collection system itself.</li>\n<li>Basic error reporting, which is health data about the operating system and applications running on your device.\nFor example, basic error reporting tells us if an application, such as Microsoft Paint or a third-party game, hangs or crashes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong> includes more detailed information about your device and its settings, capabilities, and device health.\nOptional diagnostic data also includes data about the websites you browse, device activity (also sometimes referred to as usage), and enhanced error reporting that helps Microsoft to fix and improve products and services for all users.\nWhen you choose to send Optional diagnostic data, Required diagnostic data will always be included, and we collect the following additional information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional data about the device, connectivity, and configuration, beyond that collected under Required diagnostic data.</li>\n<li>Status and logging information about the health of operating system and other system components beyond that collected about the update and diagnostics systems under Required diagnostic data.\n</li>\n<li>App activity, such as which programs are launched on a device, how long they run, and how quickly they respond to input.\n</li>\n<li>Browser activity, including browsing history and search terms, in Microsoft browsers (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer).\n</li>\n<li>Enhanced error reporting, including the memory state of the device when a system or app crash occurs (which may unintentionally contain user content, such as parts of a file you were using when the problem occurred).\nCrash data is never used for Tailored experiences as described below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the data described above may not be collected from your device even if you choose to send Optional diagnostic data.\nMicrosoft minimizes the volume of Optional diagnostic data it collects from all devices by collecting some of the data from only a subset of devices (sample).\nBy running the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool, you can see an icon which indicates whether your device is part of a sample and also which specific data is collected from your device.\nInstructions for how to download the Diagnostic Data Viewer tool can be found at <strong>Start &gt.\nSettings &gt.\nPrivacy &gt.\nDiagnostics &amp.\nfeedback</strong>.</p>\n<p>Specific data items collected in Windows diagnostics are subject to change to give Microsoft flexibility to collect the data needed for the purposes described.\nFor example, to ensure Microsoft can troubleshoot the latest performance issue impacting users\u2019 computing experience or update a Windows 10 device that is new to the market, Microsoft may need to collect data items that were not collected previously.\nFor a current list of data types collected at <strong>Required diagnostic data</strong> and <strong>Optional diagnostic data</strong>, see Windows Required (Basic level) diagnostic events and fields or Windows 10 Optional (Full level) diagnostic data.\nWe provide limited portions of error report information to partners (such as the device manufacturer) to help them troubleshoot products and services which work with Windows and other Microsoft product and services.\nThey are only permitted to use this information to repair or improve those products and services.\nWe may also share some aggregated, de-identified diagnostic data, such as general usage trends for Windows apps and features, with selected third parties.\nLearn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inking and typing Recognition</strong>.\nYou also can choose to help Microsoft improve inking and typing recognition by sending inking and typing diagnostic data.\nIf you choose to do so, Microsoft will collect samples of the content you type or write to improve features such as handwriting recognition, autocompletion, next word prediction, and spelling correction in the many languages used by Windows customers.\nWhen Microsoft collects inking and typing diagnostic data, it is divided into small samples and processed to remove unique identifiers, sequencing information, and other data (such as email addresses and numeric values) which could be used to reconstruct the original content or associate the input to you.\nIt also includes associated performance data, such as changes you manually make to text, as well as words you've added to the dictionary.\nLearn more about improving inking and typing in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>If you choose to turn on <strong>Tailored experiences</strong>, we will use your Windows diagnostic data (Basic or Full as you have selected) to offer you personalized tips, ads, and recommendations to enhance Microsoft experiences.\nIf you have selected Basic as your diagnostic data setting, personalization is based on information about your device, its settings and capabilities, and whether it is performing properly.\nIf you have selected Full, personalization is also based on information about how you use apps and features, plus additional information about the health of your device.\nHowever, we do not use information about the websites you browse, the content of crash dumps, speech, typing, or inking input data for personalization when we receive such data from customers who have selected Full.</p>\n<p>Tailored experiences include suggestions on how to customize and optimize Windows, as well as ads and recommendations for Microsoft and third-party products and services, features, apps, and hardware for your Windows experiences.\nFor example, to help you get the most out of your device, we may tell you about features you may not know about or that are new.\nIf you are having a problem with your Windows device, you may be offered a solution.\nYou may be offered a chance to customize your lock screen with pictures, or to be shown more pictures of the kind you like, or fewer of the ones you don\u2019t.\nIf you stream movies in your browser, you may be recommended an app from the Microsoft Store that streams more efficiently.\nOr, if you are running out of space on your hard drive, Windows may recommend you try OneDrive or purchase hardware to gain more space.\nLearn more about tailored experiences in Windows 10.</p>Feedback HubFeedback HubmainfeedbackhubmoduleSummary<p>Feedback Hub is a preinstalled app that provides a way to gather feedback on Microsoft products and installed first party and third-party apps.\nYou can sign into Feedback Hub using either your personal Microsoft account or an account provided by your organization (such as your employer or school) that you use to sign into Microsoft products.\nSigning in with your work or school account allows you to submit feedback to Microsoft in association with your organization.</p>\n<p>Any feedback you provide whether using your work or school account or personal Microsoft account may be publicly viewable depending on the settings configured by your organization\u2019s administrators.\nAdditionally, if feedback is provided using your work or school account, your feedback can be viewed through the Feedback Hub by your organization\u2019s administrators.</p>\n<p>When you submit feedback to Microsoft about a problem or add more details to a problem, diagnostic data will be sent to Microsoft to improve Microsoft products and services.\nDepending on your Diagnostic data settings in <strong>Start</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Settings</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Privacy</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Diagnostics &amp.\nfeedback</strong>, Feedback Hub will either send diagnostic data automatically or you will have the option to send it to Microsoft at the time you provide feedback.\nBased on the category chosen when submitting feedback, there may be additional personal data collected that helps to further troubleshoot issues.\nfor example, location related information when submitting feedback about location services or gaze related information when submitting feedback on Mixed Reality.\nMicrosoft may also share your feedback along with the data collected when you submit your feedback with Microsoft partners (such as a device manufacturer, or firmware developer) to help them troubleshoot products and services that work with Windows and other Microsoft products and services.\nLearn more about diagnostic data in Windows 10.</p>Location services, motion sensing, and recordingLocation services, motion sensing, and recordingmainlocationservicesmotionsensingmoduleSummary<p>\n<strong>Windows location service</strong>.\nMicrosoft operates a location service that helps determine the precise geographic location of a specific Windows device.\nDepending on the capabilities of the device, the device\u2019s location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy and may in some cases be determined precisely.\nWhen you have enabled location on a Windows device, or you have given permission for Microsoft apps to access location information on non-Windows devices, data about cell towers and Wi-Fi access points and their locations is collected by Microsoft and added to the location database after removing any data identifying the person or device from which it was collected.\nThis de-identified copy of location information is used to improve Microsoft's location services and, in some instances, shared with our location service provider partners, currently HERE (see https://www.here.com/), to improve the location services of the provider.</p>\n<p>Windows services and features (such as browsers and Cortana), apps running on Windows, and websites opened in Windows browsers can access the device\u2019s location through Windows if your settings allow them to do so.\nSome features and apps request location permission when you first install Windows, some ask the first time you use the app, and others ask every time you access the device\u2019s location.\nFor information about certain Windows apps that use the device\u2019s location, see the Windows apps section of this privacy statement.</p>\n<p>When an app or feature accesses the device\u2019s location and you are signed in with a Microsoft account, your Windows device will also upload its location to the cloud where it is available across your devices to other apps or services that use your Microsoft account and for which you\u2019ve granted permission.\nWe will retain only the last known location (each new location replaces the previous one).\nData about a Windows device's recent location history is also stored on the device even if not using a Microsoft account, and certain apps and Windows features can access this location history.\nYou can clear your device's location history at any time in the device's Settings menu.\n</p>\n<p>In Settings, you can also view which apps have access to the device\u2019s precise location or your device's location history, turn off or on access to the device\u2019s location for particular apps, or turn off access to the device\u2019s location.\nYou can also set a default location, which will be used when the location service can\u2019t detect a more exact location for your device.</p>\n<p>Even when you\u2019ve turned off access to the device\u2019s location, some third-party desktop apps and services could use other technologies (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, cellular modem, etc.) to determine the device\u2019s precise location.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to determine your device\u2019s location when the device\u2019s location setting is off.</p>\n<p>In addition, to facilitate getting help in an emergency, whenever you make an emergency call, Windows will attempt to determine and share your precise location, regardless of your location settings.\nIf your device has a SIM card or is otherwise using cellular service, your mobile operator will have access to your device\u2019s location.\nLearn more about location in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>General Location</strong>.\nIf you turn on the General Location feature, apps that cannot use your precise location will have access to your general location, such as your city, postal code, or region.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find My Phone</strong>.\nThe Find My Phone feature allows you to find the location of your Windows phone from the Microsoft account website, even if you have turned off all access to the location service on the phone.\nIf you have turned on the \"save my location every few hours\" feature in the Find My Phone settings on your phone, the Find My Phone feature will periodically send and store a single last-known location of your phone, even if you have turned off location services on your phone.\nEach time a new location is sent, it replaces the previously-stored location.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Find my device</strong>.\nThe Find my device feature allows an administrator of a Windows portable device to find the location of that device from account.microsoft.com/devices.\nTo enable Find my device, an administrator needs to be signed in with a Microsoft account and have the location setting enabled.\nThis feature will work even if other users have denied access to location for all their apps.\nWhen the administrator attempts to locate the device, users will see a notification in the notification area.\nLearn more about Find my device in Windows 10.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Windows motion sensing</strong>.\nWindows devices with motion activity detection can collect motion activity.\nThis data can enable features such as a pedometer to count the number of steps you take, so a fitness application can estimate how many calories you burn.\nThis data and history is stored on your device and can be accessed by applications you give permission to access and use that data.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Recording</strong>.\nSome Windows devices have a recording feature that allows you to capture audio and video clips of your activity on the device, including your communications with others.\nIf you choose to record a session, the recording will be saved locally on your device.\nIn some cases, you may have the option to transmit the recording to a Microsoft product or service that broadcasts the recording publicly.\n<strong>Important: You should understand your legal responsibilities before recording and/or transmitting any communication.\nThis includes whether you need to get consent from all parties to the communication in advance</strong>.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for how you use recording features or your recordings.</p>Security and safety featuresSecurity and safety featuresmainsecurityandsafetyfeaturesmoduleSummary<p>\n<strong>Device encryption</strong>.\nDevice encryption helps protect the data stored on your device by encrypting it using BitLocker Drive Encryption technology.\nWhen device encryption is on, Windows automatically encrypts the drive Windows is installed on and generates a recovery key.\nThe BitLocker recovery key for your personal device is automatically backed up online in your personal Microsoft OneDrive account.\nMicrosoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Malicious Software Removal Tool</strong>.\nThe Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) runs on your device at least once per month as part of Windows Update.\nMSRT checks devices for infections by specific, prevalent malicious software (\"malware\") and helps remove any infections found.\nWhen the MSRT runs, it will remove the malware listed on the Microsoft Support website if the malware is on your device.\nDuring a malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific data about malware detected, errors, and other data about your device.\nIf you do not want MSRT to send this data to Microsoft, you can disable MSRT's reporting component.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Family</strong>.\nParents can use Microsoft Family to understand and set boundaries on how their child is using their device.\nThere are many features available to Family members, so please carefully review the information provided when you create or join a Family.\nWhen Family activity reporting is turned on for a child, Microsoft will collect details about how the child uses their device and provide parents with reports of that child's activities.\nActivity reports are routinely deleted from Microsoft servers after a short period of time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender SmartScreen</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen helps protect you when using our services by checking downloaded files and web content for malicious software, potentially unsafe web content, and other threats to you or your device.\nWhen checking a file, data about that file is sent to Microsoft, including the file name, a hash of the file's contents, the download location, and the file's digital certificates.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen identifies the file as unknown or potentially unsafe, you will see a warning prior to opening the file.\nWhen checking web content, data about the content and your device is sent to Microsoft, including the full web address of the content.\nIf Microsoft Defender SmartScreen detects that content is potentially unsafe, you will see a warning in place of the content.\nMicrosoft Defender SmartScreen can be turned on or off in Settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Microsoft Defender Antivirus</strong>.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus looks for malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content on your device.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus is automatically turned on to help protect your device if no other antimalware software is actively protecting your device.\nIf Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, it will monitor the security status of your device.\nWhen Microsoft Defender Antivirus is turned on, or is running because Limited Periodic Scanning is enabled, it will automatically send reports to Microsoft that contain data about suspected malware and other unwanted software, potentially unwanted apps, and other malicious content, and it may also send files that could contain malicious content, such as malware or unknown files for further inspection.\nIf a report is likely to contain personal data, the report is not sent automatically, and you'll be prompted before it is sent.\nYou can configure Microsoft Defender Antivirus not to send reports and suspected malware to Microsoft.</p>Speech, Voice Activation, Inking, and TypingSpeech, Voice Activation, Inking, and TypingmainspeechinkingtypingmoduleSummary<p>\n<strong>Speech</strong>.\nMicrosoft provides both a device-based speech recognition feature and a cloud-based (online) speech recognition service, in regions where Cortana is available.\nTo learn more about what languages and regions speech currently supports, see Cortana\u2019s regions and languages.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on the online speech recognition setting lets you use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition in Cortana, the Mixed Reality Portal, dictation in Windows from the software keyboard, supported Microsoft Store apps, and over time in other parts of Windows.\n</p>\n<p> Turning on speech while setting up a HoloLens device or installing Windows Mixed Reality allows you to use your voice for commands, dictation, and app interactions.\nBoth device-based speech recognition and online speech recognition settings will be enabled.\nWith both settings enabled, while your headset is turned on the device will always be listening to your voice input and will send your voice data to Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition service.\n</p>\n<p> When you use the Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition service, Microsoft collects and uses your voice recordings to create a text transcription of the spoken words in the voice data.\nThe voice data is used in the aggregate to help improve our ability to correctly recognize all users\u2019 speech.\n</p>\n<p> You can use device-based speech recognition without sending your voice data to Microsoft.\nHowever, Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based speech recognition service provides more accurate recognition than the device-based speech recognition.\nWhen the online speech recognition setting is turned off, speech services that don\u2019t rely on the cloud and only use device-based recognition\u2014like the Narrator app or the Windows Speech Recognition app\u2014will still work.\n</p>\n<p> If you\u2019ve given permission in Cortana, we also collect additional information, like your name and nickname, your recent calendar events, and the names of the people in your appointments, information about your contacts including names and nicknames, names of your favorite places, apps you use, and information about your music preferences.\nThis additional data enables us to better recognize people, events, places, and music when you dictate commands, messages, or documents.\n</p>\n<p> You can turn off online speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop your voice data from being sent to Microsoft.\nIf you are using a HoloLens or mixed reality headset, you can also turn off device-based speech recognition at any time.\nThis will stop the device from listening for your voice input.\nTo control the voice data Microsoft has associated with your Microsoft account, please visit the Microsoft privacy dashboard.\nWhen you turn off the online speech recognition setting, any voice data collected while you were not signed in with a Microsoft account will be disassociated from your device.\nLearn more about the online speech recognition in Windows 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Voice Activation</strong>.\nWindows provides supported apps with the ability to respond and take action based on voice keywords that are specific to that app\u2014for example allowing Cortana to listen and respond to \u201cHey Cortana.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve given permission for an app to listen for voice keywords, Windows 10 will be actively listening to the microphone for these keywords.\nOnce a keyword is recognized, the app will have access to your voice recording, can process the recording, take action, and respond, such as with a spoken answer.\nThe app may send the voice recording to its own services in the cloud to process the commands.\nEach app should ask you for permission before accessing voice recordings.\nMicrosoft does not collect voice recordings on behalf of any third-party apps for which you have allowed voice activation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, voice activation can be enabled when the device is locked.\nIf enabled, the relevant app will continue listening to the microphone for voice keywords when you have locked your device and can activate for anyone who speaks near the device.\nWhen the device is locked, the app will have access to the same set of capabilities and information as when the device is unlocked.</p>\n<p> You can turn off voice activation at any time.\nLearn more about voice activation in Windows 10.\n</p>\n<p> Even when you\u2019ve turned off voice activation, some third-party desktop apps and services could still be listening to the microphone and collect your voice input.\nLearn more about third-party desktop apps and how they may still be able to access your microphone even with these settings turned off.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Inking &amp.\nTyping Personalization</strong>.\nYour typed and handwritten words are collected to provide you

displays photos and videos according to their time.\nThe Album tab helps users organize their photos and videos by location and common tags.\nThe People tab helps you organize your photos and videos by grouping photos and videos with similar faces, which you can then associate with contacts.</p>\n<p>If you enable the People setting on the Photos app's settings page, the app will use both face detection and recognition technologies to organize your photos and videos into groups.\nThe grouping feature uses facial detection to identify photos and videos containing faces and facial recognition to group photos and videos associated with a given person.\nOnce grouped, you may associate a facial grouping with a contact from your People App.</p>\n<p>Photos' facial groupings and associated data are only accessible to you within the Photos app.\nMicrosoft does not access or use this facial data for any purpose outside the Photos app.\nYou, and not Microsoft, are responsible for ensuring you have appropriate permissions from the people in your photos and videos to use facial grouping technology to group your photos and videos in your personal albums.</p>\n<p>Your groupings will be stored on your device for as long as you elect to keep the groupings or the photos or videos.\nIf the People setting is turned on, you will be prompted to allow the Photos app to continue to permit facial groupings after three years of non-interaction with the Photos app.\nAt any time, you can go to the Settings page in the Photos app to turn the People setting on or off.\nLearn more about the Photos

reviews.\nand if you write a review, the name and picture from your Microsoft account will be published with your review.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Permission for Microsoft Store apps</strong>.\nMany apps you install from the Microsoft Store are designed to take advantage of specific hardware and software features of your device.\nAn app's use of certain hardware and software features may give the app or its related service access to your data.\nFor example, a photo editing app might access your device's camera to let you take a new photo or access photos or videos stored on your device for editing, and a restaurant guide might use your location to provide nearby recommendations.\nInformation about the features that an app uses is provided on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store.\nMany of the features that Microsoft Store apps use can be turned on or off through your device\u2019s privacy settings.\nIn Windows, in many cases, you can choose which apps can use a particular feature.\nGo to <strong>Start &gt.\nSettings &gt.\nPrivacy,</strong> select the feature (for example, Calendar), and then select which app permissions are on or off.\nThe lists of apps in Windows privacy settings that can use hardware and software features will not include \"Classic Windows\" applications, and these applications are not affected by these settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>App updates</strong>.\nUnless you have turned off automatic app updates in the relevant Microsoft Store settings, Microsoft Store will automatically check for, download, and install app updates to ensure that you have the latest versions.\nUpdated apps might use different Windows hardware and software features from the previous versions, which could give them access to different data on your device.\nYou will be prompted for consent if an updated app accesses certain features, such as location.\nYou can also review the hardware and software features an app uses by viewing its product description page in Microsoft Store.</p>\n<p>Each app's use of your data collected through any of these features is subject to the app developer's privacy policies.\nIf an app available through Microsoft Store collects and uses any of your personal data, the app developer is required to provide a privacy policy, and a link to the privacy policy is available on the app's product description page in Microsoft Store.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sideloaded apps and developer mode</strong>.\nDeveloper features such as the \"developer mode\" setting are intended for development use only.\nIf you enable developer features, your device may become unreliable or unusable, and expose you to security risks.\nDownloading or otherwise acquiring apps from sources other than Microsoft Store, also known as \"sideloading\" apps, may make your device and personal data more vulnerable to attack or unexpected use by apps.\nWindows policies, notifications, permissions, and other features intended to help protect your privacy when apps access your data may not function as described in this statement for sideloaded apps or when developer features are enabled.</p>MSNMSNmainmainmoduleSummary<p>MSN

intensive features (such as games, maps, and images), and storing content that you create within certain applications.\nYou can turn off or configure application storage in the Silverlight Configuration tool.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Silverlight updates</strong>.\nSilverlight will periodically check a Microsoft server for updates to provide you with the latest features and improvements.\nA small file containing information about the latest Silverlight version will be downloaded to your computer and compared to your currently installed version.\nIf a newer version is available, it will be downloaded and installed on your computer.\nYou can turn off or configure updates in the Silverlight Configuration tool.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Digital Rights Management</strong>.\nSilverlight uses Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM) technology to help protect the rights of content owners.\nIf you access DRM-protected content (such as music or video) with Silverlight, it will request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet.\nIn order to provide a seamless playback experience, you will not be prompted before Silverlight sends the request to the rights server.\nWhen requesting media usage rights, Silverlight will provide the rights server with an ID for the DRM-protected content file and basic data about your device, including data about the DRM components on your device such as their revision and security levels, and a unique identifier for your device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>DRM updates</strong>.\nIn some cases, accessing DRM-protected content will require an update to Silverlight or to the DRM components on your device.\nWhen you attempt to play content that requires a DRM update, Silverlight will send a request to a Microsoft server containing basic data about your device, including information about the DRM components on your computer such as their revision and security levels, troubleshooting data, and a unique identifier for your device.\nThe Microsoft server uses this identifier to return a unique DRM update for your device, which will then be installed by Silverlight.\nYou can turn off or configure DRM component updates on the <strong>Playback</strong> tab in the Silverlight Configuration tool.</p>Windows Mixed RealityWindows Mixed RealitymainwindowsmixedrealitymoduleSummary<p>Windows Mixed Reality allows you to enable a

Arbitration and Class Action Waiver If You Live In (or Are a Business with Your Principal Place of Business In) the United States</strong>.\nWe hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally.\nIf we can\u2019t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.\nInstead, a neutral arbitrator will decide and the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.\nClass action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren\u2019t allowed.\nNor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.\n\"We,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" includes Microsoft and its affiliates.</p>\n<p>a.\n<strong>Disputes Covered\u2014Everything Except IP.\n</strong>The term \"dispute\" is as broad as it can be.\nIt includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Store (including the Services), any advertising, marketing, or communications, any products or services offered or sold, any purchase transactions or billing, or these Terms of Sale or Store Policies, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, <strong>except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your, your licensors\u2019, our, or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights</strong>.</p>\n<p>b.\n<strong>Mail a Notice of Dispute First.\n</strong>If you have a dispute and our customer service representatives can\u2019t resolve it, send a Notice of Dispute by U.S.\nMail to Microsoft Corporation, ATTN: CELA Arbitration, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399.\nTell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want.\nA form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245499.\nWe\u2019ll do the same if we have a dispute with you.\nYou and Microsoft will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.\nAfter 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.</p>\n<p>c.\n<strong>Small Claims Court Option.\n</strong>Instead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington, if you meet the court\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p>d.\n<strong>Arbitration Procedure.\n</strong>The AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Store or Services for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Store or Services, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).\nFor more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.\nTo start an arbitration, submit the form available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=245497&nbsp;to the AAA and mail a copy to us.\nIn a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.\nAny in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or King County, Washington.\nYou choose.\nThe arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.\nUnder Commercial Rule 7 or Consumer Rule 14, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.\nBut a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.</p>\n<p>e.\n<strong>A</strong>\n<strong>rbitration Fees and Payments.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>i.\n<strong>Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.</strong> We will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nIf you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \"award\"), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.\n(ii) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\nand (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.</p>\n<p>ii.\n<strong>Disputes Involving More than $75,000.</strong> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p>f.\n<strong>Must File Within One Year.\n</strong>You and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes \u2013 see Section 28(a)) within one year from when it first could be filed.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s permanently barred.</p>\n<p>g.\n<strong>Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.\n</strong>You may reject any change Microsoft makes to Section 28 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.\nMail to the address in Section 28(b).\nIf you do, the most recent version of Section 28 before the change you rejected will apply.</p>\n<p>h.\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won\u2019t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration.\nIf any other provision of Section 28 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of Section 28 still applies.</p>\n<p>i.\n<strong>Conflict with AAA Rules.\n</strong>These Terms of Sale govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</p>\n<p>29.\n<strong>Interpreting These Terms.\n</strong>All parts of these Terms of Sale apply to the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law.\nyou may have greater rights in your jurisdiction of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business).\nIf it is determined that we can\u2019t enforce a part of these Terms of Sale as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms of Sale won\u2019t change.\nSection 28(h) says what happens if parts of Section 28 (arbitration and class action waiver) are found to be illegal or unenforceable.\nSection 28(h) prevails over this section if inconsistent with it.\nExcept for Section 28 (arbitration and class action waiver), these Terms of Sale are solely for your and our benefit.\nthey aren\u2019t for the benefit of any other person, except for Microsoft\u2019s successors and assigns.\nOther terms may apply if you purchase products or services from other Microsoft websites.</p>\n<p>30.\n<strong>Assignment.\n</strong>We may assign,
