include differing amounts due to promotional offers, changing your Additional Services plan (where permitted) and changes in the amount of taxes we collect.\nYou authorize Canary to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, or to provide you a credit, on your next billing cycle.\nPayments for our Additional Services are processed through our third party payment processors.</p>\n<p>If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum contract period, you are committing to the minimum contract period specified at the time of your order (e.g., 24 months).\nYou may cancel your Additional Services plan with a minimum contract period at any time, subject to your payment to us at the time of cancellation an early termination fee equal to the entire amount that you would have paid to us if you had completed the remainder of your minimum contract period.\nFor example, if your Additional Services with a minimum contract period is billed at $14.99 monthly + tax and includes a 24-month contract, and you cancel in month 14, your early termination fee would be $149.90 + tax due at the time of cancellation.</p>\n<p>We may evaluate your credit history before modifying or providing you Additional Services, including obtaining a report from a consumer credit agency or exchanging information with our affiliates in connection with determining your creditworthiness.\nIf you fail to pay your bill, we may submit a negative credit report to a credit reporting agency, which will negatively affect your credit report.</p>\n<p>If a payment for Additional Services with a minimum contract period is not successful, you remain responsible for any unpaid amounts, and after a grace period that we determine of at least 30 days, we may consider that you have canceled your Additional Services plan, in which case an early termination fee will apply, due at the time of cancellation or deemed cancellation, equal to the entire amount that you would have paid to us if you had completed the remainder of your minimum contract period specified at the time of your order (see the sample calculation above).\nImposing an early termination fee does not affect our right to take legal or other collection action against you for non-payment, to charge you interest, or to request that you return to us Equipment that we own.\nIf you are past due on amounts owed to us for Additional Services with a minimum contract period, we may also temporarily or permanently remotely disable your Equipment so that it will not operate, even if you give or otherwise transfer it.</p>\n<p>If you purchase Additional Services with a minimum contract period and you do not make any payment due to us by the due date for payment, we may also charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of the lesser of (a) 6% a year above the \"prime rate\" as reported by the Wall Street Journal or any successor publication and (b) the maximum interest rate allowed by law.\nThis interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.\nYou will be required to pay interest together with any overdue amount unless you dispute a request for payment in good faith and contact us to let us know promptly after you have received a payment request of your dispute, in which case we may choose not to apply interest for the period of the dispute.</p>\n<p>In addition to any early termination or other fees that apply, you also agree to reimburse us for our reasonable costs, fees and expenses in connection with any collection activities we undertake arising from your failure to pay us any amounts owed when due, including our reasonable attorneys fees and collection agency fees.\nIf you fail to pay on time and we refer your account(s) to a third party for collection, we may assess a collection fee that will be due at the time of the referral to the third party.\nThe fee will be calculated at the maximum percentage permitted by applicable law, but not to exceed 18 percent per annum of the amount due.</p>Free Trials<p>Your Canary Additional Services may begin with a free trial for a limited period of time.\nIf you receive a free trial, the specific offer terms will be stated in the material describing the free trial offer.\nFree trials are for new Canary customers only.\nWe will not combine free trials with any other offers.\nWhen a free trial ends, if authorized by you during the registration process, your paid Additional Services will begin and we will charge your payment method accordingly.\nCanary reserves the right to determine and limit eligibility for any free trial.</p>\n<p>Once your free trial period ends, we will begin billing your Payment Method for the monthly or annual Additional Services fees corresponding to the Additional Services you chose at the time of purchase (plus any applicable taxes), unless you cancel in a timely manner according to our policies prior to the end of your free trial.\nFor that reason, unless otherwise indicated in the free trial description, you may be asked to set up a valid Payment Method for continuation charges when redeeming a free trial offer.\nIf you wish to avoid charges to your Payment Method, you must cancel your Additional Services prior to the last day of your free trial period.\nYou may cancel your Additional Services at any time as described in the Cancellation section of these Terms.</p>Billing<p>CANARY WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES ON OR ABOUT EACH MONTHLY OR ANNUAL ANNIVERSARY OF THAT DATE THAT CANARY FIRST CHARGES YOU FOR THE FIRST ADDITIONAL SERVICES FEE.</p>\n<p>IN ADDITION AND, AS AUTHORIZED BY YOU DURING THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES SIGN-UP PROCESS, CANARY WILL CHARGE YOU THE APPLICABLE MONTHLY OR ANNUAL ADDITIONAL SERVICES FEE AND ANY SALES OR SIMILAR TAXES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED ON YOUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES FEE PAYMENT UNLESS YOU CANCEL PRIOR TO THE RENEWAL DATE.</p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL SERVICES WILL <u>NOT</u> AUTOMATICALLY RENEW IF YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.\nYOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR MONTHLY

number associated with your account, via mobile push notification, or via other methods you authorize, for billing reminders, to collect a debt owed to us, for Canary promotional offers and other account-related communications.\nStandard message and data rates may apply to text messages.\nYour registration and use of Products including Additional Services constitutes consent to receiving these communications from Canary regarding your account.\nIt is not a condition of purchase that you accept promotional calls or texts.\nYou may opt out of marketing and promotional calls or messages by following the applicable unsubscribe instructions provided to you.\nFollowing such opt-out, you may continue to receive calls or messages for a short period of time while we process your request.\nIt is your responsibility to keep your account information, including your phone number, updated.\nBy purchasing our Products, you are agreeing that any agreements, notices, disclosures and other such communications sent to you by Canary via any method of communication will satisfy any legal requirements, such as receiving notice in writing or certified mail.\nYou will be liable for paying any and all applicable sales and use taxes for the purchase of your Additional Services based on the mailing address that you provide when you register for them, and you authorize Canary to charge your credit or debit card for any such applicable taxes.</p>\n<p>If Canary is unable to successfully charge your credit card or payment account for fees due, Canary reserves the right to revoke or restrict access to our services, delete your stored content in accordance with our data retention policies and procedures, or terminate your account.\nIf you want to designate a different credit card or payment account, or if there is a change in your credit card or payment account status, you may change your Payment Method by logging into your account and making all necessary payment related changes to your account profile.\nMaking such changes may temporarily disrupt your access to the services while Canary verifies your new payment information and may result in a change to your payment billing date.</p>Cancellation<p>YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES AT ANY TIME BY CONTACTING CANARY BY TELEPHONE AT (844) 294-4163 (US), 0 800 090 3699 (UK), OR VIA EMAIL AT SUPPORT@CANARY.IS ONLY IF YOU

CONNECTION WILL <u>NOT</u> TRIGGER CANCELLATION OF THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES.\nCANARY REQUIRES A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO PROCESS CANCELLATION REQUESTS.\nIF YOU CANCEL ADDITIONAL SERVICES WITH A MINIMUM CONTRACT PERIOD, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION AN EARLY TERMINATION FEE EQUAL TO THE ENTIRE AMOUNT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE PAID TO US IF YOU HAD COMPLETED THE REMAINDER OF YOUR MINIMUM CONTRACT TERM (SEE ABOVE UNDER \"PAYMENTS\" FOR DETAILS).</p>\n<p>MONTHLY ADDITIONAL SERVICES PLANS MAY BE CANCELLED FOR A FULL REFUND WITHIN THREE DAYS OF INITIAL REGISTRATION.\nIF YOU CANCEL YOUR MONTHLY ADDITIONAL SERVICES OR DOWNGRADE TO A LOWER PRICED ADDITIONAL SERVICES PLAN AT ANY TIME AFTER THREE DAYS OF REGISTRATION, YOU WILL ENJOY YOUR EXISTING ADDITIONAL SERVICES UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT ADDITIONAL SERVICES TERM FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID, AND YOUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES BENEFITS WILL EXPIRE OR DOWNGRADE AT THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT ADDITIONAL SERVICES TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR REQUEST.\nTHE FOREGOING DOES NOT APPLY TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES WITH A MINIMUM CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH CANNOT BE DOWNGRADED AND ARE SUBJECT TO <u>THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE DESCRIBED ABOVE IF CANCELED</u>.\n<u>WE DO NOT PROVIDE PARTIAL OR PRO-RATED MONTH REFUNDS OR CREDITS.</u> ANNUAL PLANS MAY BE CANCELLED WITHIN THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS OF REGISTERING FOR A FULL REFUND.\nANY CANCELLATION AFTER THE FIRST FOURTEEN DAYS OF REGISTERING WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT ANNUAL BILLING PERIOD AND NO CREDITS OR REFUNDS WILL BE ISSUED.\nYOUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES BENEFITS WILL, AT THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT ANNUAL ADDITIONAL SERVICES TERM, AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR ANOTHER YEAR.\nYOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THE AUTOMATIC RENEWAL FOR MONTHLY OR ANNUAL ADDITIONAL

COUNTRY IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE US OR UK.\nFOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES WITH A MINIMUM CONTRACT PERIOD, UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW, YOU MAY ONLY CANCEL THE PRODUCTS WITHIN FOURTEEN (14) DAYS OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE IF YOU RETURN YOUR EQUIPMENT IN ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION, IN WHICH CASE YOU WILL RECEIVE A FULL REFUND.\nTHEREAFTER, ADDITIONAL SERVICES WITH A MINIMUM CONTRACT PERIOD CANNOT BE DOWNGRADED OR CANCELED AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE EARLY TERMINATION FEE DESCRIBED ABOVE.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise noted, any fees paid by you prior to your cancellation are nonrefundable (except as expressly permitted otherwise by these Terms or as may be required by law), including any fees paid in advance for the billing cycle during which you cancel.\nTermination of your account past the relevant deadline for cancellation shall not relieve you of any obligation to pay any accrued fees or charges to which you committed and failed to timely cancel.\nUpon cancellation of your Additional Services plan, you will lose access to the benefits of the Additional Services plan and, after a period of time as short as immediately, Canary will delete information and data stored as part of your account in accordance with our current plans and related storage limits.</p>\n<p>As noted above, you may not transfer your Additional Services to any other person, whether or not you give your Equipment to that person.\nSubject to the prohibitions on resale set forth above and the more specific provisions above pertaining to Additional Services with a minimum contract period, transferring your Equipment is permitted, but you will not receive a pro-rated refund for the balance of any remaining term of your Additional Services plan associated with the Equipment if you cancel your Additional Services and/or deactivate your Equipment.\nThe person to whom you give your Equipment must purchase her own Additional Service if interested, and will not receive any credit or other monetary benefit due to your Equipment having been associated with a Additional Service plan which was not utilized for its full term.</p>Availability of Additional Services<p>You agree to use Additional Services only for purposes permitted by these Terms and including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced or available by hyperlink at www.canary.is/legal as

behalf.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Indemnification.</b> IF ANYONE OTHER AN YOU, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY, ASKS CANARY OR NOONLIGHT TO PAY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR EXPENSE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ECONOMIC LOSSES, PROPERTY DAMAGE, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH) DUE TO (I) BREACH OF CONTRACT OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, (II) ACTIVE OR PASSIVE SOLE, JOINT OR SEVERAL NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND OR DEGREE BY THE CANARY REPRESENTATIVES OR THE NOONLIGHT REPRESENTATIVES, (III) FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION OF THE COMMUNICATION PATH BETWEEN THE PRODUCTS AND THE MONITORING FACILITY OR THE MONITORING FACILITY'S FACILITIES, (IV) RECORDING OF COMMUNICATIONS OR VIDEO SURVEILLANCE/RECORDING, (V) PRODUCT OR STRICT LIABILITY, OR (VI) A CLAIM FOR SUBROGATION, INDEMNIFICATION OR CONTRIBUTION, YOU AGREE TO PAY (WITHOUT ANY CONDITION THAT CANARY OR NOONLIGHT REPRESENTATIVES PAY FIRST) FOR ALL LOSSES, DAMAGES, COSTS AND EXPENSES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ATTORNEY'S FEES, WHICH MAY BE ASSERTED AGAINST OR INCURRED BY CANARY OR NOONLIGHT REPRESENTATIVES.\n\"<b>Canary Representatives</b>\" mean Canary and its shareholders, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, interns, contractors, suppliers, service providers, licensors and agents.\n\"<b>Noonlight Representatives</b>\" mean Noonlight and its shareholders, affiliates, directors, officers, employees, interns, contractors, suppliers, service providers, licensors and agents.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Not Insurance.</b> Canary and Noonlight are not insurers.\nThe fees for Products (including, without limitation, Additional Services) are based solely upon the services provided by Canary, and is premised and conditioned upon Canary's (and, in the case of Professional Monitoring, Noonlight's) limitation of liability and other rights arising under the risk allocation clauses contained in these Sales Terms.\nAccordingly, you should maintain insurance in an amount and with coverages sufficient to provide full and complete coverage for any loss, damage or expense that may be sustained by you, your family or others who may be on or adjacent to the Premises, including medical insurance, disability insurance, life insurance and property insurance.</p>Limitation of Liability<p>Nothing in these Terms, and in particular within this \"Limitation of Liability\" section, shall attempt to exclude or limit liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</p>\n<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES,</p>\n<p>(A) IN NO CASE SHALL THE CANARY REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM YOUR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS OR DISPLAYING, COPYING, OR DOWNLOADING ANY CONTENT TO OR FROM OUR PRODUCTS, EVEN IF CANARY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nAND</p>\n<p>(B) IN NO CASE SHALL THE CANARY REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY BODILY INJURY OR HARM TO PROPERTY , OR ANY OTHER LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHICH ARISE FROM OR ARE OTHERWISE ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR USE OR OWNERSHIP OF THE EQUIPMENT, OR ARISING FROM YOUR PURCHASE FROM OUR STORE, USE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE PRODUCTS OR ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE PRODUCTS, EVEN IF CANARY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ADVISED OF SUCH A POSSIBILITY.</p>\n<p>Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the Canary Representatives' liability (and the Noonlight Representatives' liability, with respect to the Noonlight Services) shall be limited to the maximum sum of $25.00 collectively.\nIn the event that you wish to increase the maximum amount of such limited liability, you may, as a matter of right, obtain a higher limit by contacting legal@canary.is to arrange paying an additional amount for the increase in such limit of liability, but this payment shall in no way be interpreted to hold Canary or Noonlight, and their Representatives as an insurer.</p>General<p>Canary controls and operates its Service from its headquarters in the United States.\nIf you use this Service outside the United States of America, you are solely responsible for following applicable local laws.\nIn the event that any provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms, such determination shall not affect the legality, validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>Canary's failure or delay in exercising its rights or ability to enforce and provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or

&amp.\nLocation Members</b>\n</p>\n<p>The individual who first creates an account and sets up the Product is the owner of the Canary Product associated with that account and the primary account holder (\u201cLocation Owner\u201d).\nIndividuals who are authorized to access a Location Owner\u2019s Products and Services are authorized users (\u201cLocation Members\u201d) under the Location Owner\u2019s account and are invited through the Mobile Application.\nLocation Members may have the ability to use the Products and monitor and control the Products (for example, a Location Member can arm or disarm the Product or sound the Siren).\nLocation Members may also have the ability to view information (including personal information) and content across all of Location Owner\u2019s Products (for example, a Location Member will receive notifications of events or can view video).\nLocation Members are responsible for their own actions in connection with the Products and Services, but the Location Owner also agrees to be fully responsible for all actions taken by a Location Member relating to the Products and Products.</p>\n<p>Once invited by a Location Owner, Location Members can also invite other individuals to join the account as new location members.\nIf you are a Location Owner, you should therefore authorize only those individuals that you trust to access your account and the Services.</p>\n<p>Location Owners have special privileges associated with their account and are the only individuals that can authorize specific actions or settings.\nFor example, Location Owners are

personal information.\nCanary uses industry best practices when it comes to security.\nCanary has also conducted third-party security audits with respect to the Services.\nDespite taking these steps, Canary cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat Canary\u2019s security measures.\nYou acknowledge that you provide your personal information and your use of the Services is at your own risk.</p>9.\nIntegration With Third-Party Platforms and Services<p>Canary may allow you to integrate Canary Products with one or more third-party products or services.\nFor

Canary<p>\n<i>Please read this carefully.\nIt affects your rights.</i>\n</p>\n<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly by contacting us at support@canary.is.\nThis section relates to disputes that may arise between you and Canary.\nArbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court, and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.\nYou have the right to opt out of this provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Please read this provision carefully.</i> All Disputes between you and Canary shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration replaces the right to go to court.\nIn the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).\nExcept as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.\nThere is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.\nThe arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney\u2019s fees).</p>\n<p>For the purpose of this provision, \u201cCanary\u201d means Canary and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.\n\u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Canary regarding any aspect of your relationship with Canary, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability, or scope of this provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).\n\u201cDispute\u201d is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Canary\u2019s licensors, suppliers, dealers, or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<small>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</small>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</i>\n</p>\n<p>For all Disputes, you must first give Canary an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by mailing written notification of your dispute to Canary.\nThat written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.\nIf Canary does not resolve the Dispute within 60 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.\nYou may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</i>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the above, you or Canary may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, in which case it may be initiated in small claims court.\nor (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the \u201cOpt-Out Deadline\u201d).\nYou may opt out of this provision by mailing written notification to Canary.\nYour written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Canary through arbitration.\nAny opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Arbitration Procedures</i>\n</p>\n<p>The American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.\nThe arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.\nAll issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this provision.</p>\n<p>For arbitration before the AAA for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply.\nfor Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply.\nIn either instance, the AAA\u2019s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org.\nFor arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp.\nProcedures will apply.\nThe JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com.\nThis provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.\nUnder no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>\n<p>Because the Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.\nHowever, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Award \u2013 The arbitrator may award relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nSuch award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties.</p>\n<p>Location of Arbitration \u2013 You or Canary may initiate arbitration in either New York City, New York or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address.\nIn the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Canary may transfer the arbitration to New York City, New York if it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs \u2013 Canary will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator\u2019s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.\nYou are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.\nFees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.\nIn addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Canary as provided in the section above titled \u201cPre-Arbitration Claim Resolution\u201d and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Class Action Waiver</i>\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action, or private attorney general action) unless both you and Canary specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration.\nIf you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</p>\n<p>Neither you, nor any other user of the Site or Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Jury Waiver</i>\n</p>\n<p>You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Canary are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.\nIn the absence of this provision, you and Canary might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).\nExcept as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.\nOther rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Severability</i>\n</p>\n<p>If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision, and the remainder of this provision will be given full force and effect.\nIf the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Continuation</i>\n</p>\n<p>This provision shall survive the termination of your service with Canary or its affiliates.\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Canary makes any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Canary to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Governing Law &amp.\nVenue</b>\n<br>The Federal Arbitration Act, Delaware state law, and applicable U.S.\nfederal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms.\nThe United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement.\nExcept for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Services will be heard in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York.</p>18.\nOther Terms<p>If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified.\nCanary\u2019s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such terms.\nThese Terms are the entire agreement between you and Canary with respect to the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions, or agreements between you and Canary.</p>\n<p>\n<b>California Consumer

Video Feeds (unless Canary is required by mandatory EU or EU Member State law to retain the Personal Data);</li>\n<li>provide written responses and documentary information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with Canary\u2019s obligations under Clauses 5.1.1 - 5.1.7 above and, only to the extent required under Applicable Data Protection Law and where such compliance cannot be

contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by you or another auditor mandated by you and agreed to by Canary that relate to your Video Feeds.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, such audit shall be carried out no more than once in any 12-month period with reasonable notice, during regular business hours, in a manner which is not disruptive to Canary\u2019s business and under a duty of confidentiality.\nThe scope of such an audit will be agreed in advance and shall not involve physical access to the servers from which the Services are provided.\nYou will bear the fees of any auditor

reasonable change to your configuration or use of the Services to avoid processing of your Video Feeds by the objected-to new Sub-processor without unreasonably burdening you.\nIf Canary is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, either party may terminate without penalty the applicable subscription with respect only to those Services which cannot be provided by Canary without the use of the objected-to new Sub-processor by providing written notice to the other party.</li>\n<li>Canary shall be liable for the acts and omissions of its Sub-processors to the same extent Canary would be liable if performing the services of each Sub-processor directly under the terms of this Addendum.</li>\n<li>If and to the extent
