to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Company, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.\n<strong>Binding Arbitration: </strong>If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 10(A) (or agree to arbitration in writing with respect to an Excluded Dispute) within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND COMPANY MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.\nTHIS INCLUDES ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BASED ON ANY PRODUCT, SERVICE OR ADVERTISING CONNECTED TO THE PROVISION OR USE OF THE SITE (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT \u2013 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY \u2013 AND WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201c) shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes between COMPANY and you regarding these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and the Site, including the No Class Action Matters section below.\nBY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY.A Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc.\n(\u201cJAMS\u201c), in accordance with the then-current streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (\u201cRules\u201c) of, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of Company consent to in writing.\nIf an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the \u201cmetropolitan statistical area\u201d (as defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.\nYou and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator\u2019s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable Rules.\nbut if applicable Rules or laws require Company to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 10 to be enforceable, then Company will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator will apply and be bound by these Terms and any Additional Terms, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nIssues relating to the enforceability of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions contained herein are for the court to decide.\n<strong>Limited Time to File Claims: </strong>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 10(A)) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES \u2013 OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.\nCommencing means, as applicable: (a) by delivery of written notice as set forth above in Section 10(A).\n(b) filing for arbitration with JAMS as set forth in Section 10(B).\nor (c) filing an action in state or Federal court.\nThe parties expressly waive any contrary statute of limitations or time bars, both legal and equitable, to the Disputes.\n<strong>Injunctive Relief:</strong> The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 will not apply to any legal action taken by Company to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User Content and/or Company\u2019s intellectual property rights (including such Company may claim that may be in dispute), Company\u2019s operations, and/or Company\u2019s products or services.\n<strong>No Class Action Matters: </strong>YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION.\nDisputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.\nThere shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.\nBut if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 10(B) to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 10(F).\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this \u201cNo Class Action Matters\u201d section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.<strong>Federal and State Courts in Cook County, Illinois: </strong>Except where arbitration is required above, small claims actions, or with respect to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute arising hereunder may only be instituted in state or Federal court in Cook County, Illinois.\nAccordingly, you and Company consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.<strong>Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement:</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court of competent jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<u>DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES: </u>\n</strong>YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE IS AT YOUR SOLE
