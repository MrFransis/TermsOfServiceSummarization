used by the TICE App are provided by&nbsp;Amazon Web Services&nbsp;(hereinafter referred to as&nbsp;<em>Hoster</em>) and are located in Frankfurt, Germany.\nAll data of the TICE App listed below, which are processed by the operator, can also be processed by the hoster.\nThe hoster has committed itself to process the personal data in accordance with DSGVO (see&nbsp;AWS Service Terms).</p> 2.1.\nPersonal data <p>The app processes personal data of the users on their respective devices to fulfill its purpose.\nCertain data, which are named below, will be transferred to other persons or the operator to fulfill the service.\nWe process and store personal data only for the period of time required to achieve the service or if required by law.\nThe processing purpose is usually achieved by deleting the user profile (\u201cAccount\u201d or \u201c(user) profile\u201d).</p> 2.1.1.\nData sent to the operator: <ul>\n<li>IP address</li>\n<li>Random and unique identifier of the user (user ID)</li>\n<li>User name</li>\n<li>Public key information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first time users start the TICE App, they create a user profile.\nThis profile consists of a random but unique identifier that can be used to identify the user pseudonymously, public key material for the asymmetric encryption of data, and an optional&nbsp;<em>user name</em>, which is defined by the user.</p>\n<p>This profile is stored on the server and can be viewed by the operator.\nThis data can be deleted by the user at any time (see section&nbsp;Delete data).</p> 2.1.2.\nData sent to other users: <ul>\n<li>Random and unique identifier of the user (user ID)</li>\n<li>User name</li>\n<li>Public key information</li>\n<li>Location information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>User location information is transmitted to other users during an active meeting.\nFor this purpose, the information is transmitted end-to-end encrypted&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;via the Internet and via the operator\u2019s servers.\nThis encrypted data is only stored temporarily on our servers and is deleted as soon as the message has been delivered to the recipients or 30 days have passed.</p> 2.2.\nFurther data 2.2.1.\nGroups and meetings <p>Groups and meetings are used synonymously in the following Information about groups is stored on the servers operated by TICE exclusively in encrypted form<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and is deleted when the group is deleted or the meeting is terminated.\nInvitations to groups can be shared with any person via links.\nInvitation links to groups contain the key used for encryption, thus enabling a user to view the group name, group settings, list of group members, meeting place, and join the group.\nUsers are responsible for protecting group links from unauthorized third parties and for obtaining the consent of all members of the group whose link they are sharing.</p> 2.2.2.\nFeedback and bug reporting <p>Sending feedback within the app uses log files and a screenshot of the application as an attachment to an email.\nThis data may contain personal information.\nThis information is sent to us via the e-mail account selected by the user.\nThis information is sent to us according to the e-mail service used.\nThe user agrees that feedback information can be viewed and stored by us, just like any other e-mail addressed to us.</p> 2.2.3.\nAnalytics <p>To improve our services and to better understand the use of our app, we collect anonymous statistics about our app.\nFor this purpose, anonymized user interactions are transmitted to our servers.\nWe explicitly do not use pseudonyms, no personal information is included and the individual interactions in the app can not be traced or linked.</p> 2.3.\nCookies in web app <p>In our

address is actively added to the distribution list.</p>\n<p>We use this data exclusively for the dispatch of the requested information and offers.</p>\n<p>The newsletter software used is

address given in the imprint.\nFurthermore, you have the right to complain to the responsible supervisory authority.</p> 4.1.\nDelete data <p>The user profile in the TICE App can be deleted in the app\u2019s settings by using the action \u201cDelete account\u201d.\nIf the user loses access to his profile (e.g.\nby deleting the app) without having deleted the profile data beforehand, they cannot be deleted on request, as the operator cannot establish a link between a person and a profile (user ID).\nSuch orphaned profiles are automatically deleted by us after one year of inactivity (no use of the app).</p>\n<p>A user can request the deletion of feedback information sent to us by e-mail, or e-mails from a user can be deleted without giving reasons by sending an e-mail from the same account to the e-mail address mentioned in the&nbsp;imprint&nbsp;with the request for data deletion.\nWe will comply with this request as soon as possible.</p> 5.\nData and third parties <p>The data processed and stored by the operator and the hoster are processed exclusively by the aforementioned parties and are not passed on or sold to third parties.</p>\n<p>In order to guarantee data protection compliant processing, we have concluded a contract for order processing with our host and web host.</p> 6.\nUpdate of the privacy policy <p>For this reason we ask you to inform yourself about our data
