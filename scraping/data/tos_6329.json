Terms, then you agree to immediately return and pay such excess amount to us.\nYou agree that we and our agents may reverse, withdraw or cancel any debit, transaction or item that provided you with funds in error.\nYou agree that an error occurred if we or our agents send any funds to you after we receive evidence indicating that you defrauded us or provided us or our agents with false information.\nYou agree that we may initiate a new ACH debit to your Bank Account in an amount equal to such overpayment plus the amount of expenses we incurred in recovering such overpayment, including the amount of your obligations, if any, under the \u201cIndemnity\u201d provision below.</p>\n<p>In addition to any of your other representations and warranties in these Terms, you represent
