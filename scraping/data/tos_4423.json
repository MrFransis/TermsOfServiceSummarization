may at any time revoke your consent to the processing of your data when this has your consent as its legal basis (e.g.\nsending the newsletter, publishing your information in the whois of Gandi, etc.).</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about your rights or wish to exercise them, you can contact our Data Protection Officer:</p>\n<p>- By email at the following address:
