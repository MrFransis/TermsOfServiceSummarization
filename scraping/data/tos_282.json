of the 500px experience.\nRest assured that we will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below:</p>\n<br>\n<p>500px Personnel: 500px personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of 500px business.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.\nIn these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.\nMoreover, if 500px, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Protection of 500px and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law.\nto enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies.\nor to protect the rights, property, or safety of 500px, our employees, our users,

during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other 500px users in your User Profile.\nThe User Profile is the area on 500px where we allow you to tell other 500px users about yourself.\nYou may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Settings section of your User Profile.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Followers' Activity: Much like other online social networks, 500px allows non-followers to browse your followers\u2019 activity.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Syndication: 500px allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the 500px website.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Service Providers: 500px may share user information as well as information from tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, and location data, with third-parties that help 500px provide services to you (\u201cService Providers\u201d).\nOur Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary for 500px to provide our services.\n500px requires Services Providers to protect your data in a manner consistent with this Policy and to limit the use of such information to the performance of services for 500px.\n500px may also remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with Service Providers, including combining your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Data Storage: Your encrypted personal information is stored on servers provided by a third-party cloud-based service provider that protects and stores your data in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.</p>\n<br>\n<p>With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>We do not sell your information to anyone.\nHowever, we will show publicly available information to other users.\nWe may share information so that we can provide our service, and we may share information where required by law.\nWe may also share information with third-parties that help 500px provide services to you.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Keeping Information and Our Website Secure</p>\n<p>Your 500px account information is protected by an encrypted password for your privacy and security.\nProtect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it.\nAll of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.</p>\n<br>\n<p>500px has also implemented the Invisible reCAPTCHA API (\u201creCAPTCHA\u201d) to help protect our website from spam and abuse from \u201cbots\u201d and other malicious software.\nIt works by collecting hardware and software information, such as device and application data and the results of integrity checks, and sending that data to Google for analysis.\nThe use of reCAPTCHA is subject to the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>Your account is protected by an encrypted password.\nWe keep it secure.\nyou must also keep it safe.\nOur employees may not access your account unless required to do a specific job.\nWe use reCAPTCHA to help protect our website from malicious attacks.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Ways to Control Display and Use of Your Information</p>\n<p>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website.</p>\n<br>\n<p>By visiting your User Profile, you can correct, amend, add, or delete personal information on our website.</p>\n<br>\n<p>If you do not wish to receive email from us, please visit the Settings of your User Profile and/or follow the instructions contained in the unwanted email message.</p>\n<br>\n<p>However, please note that you will continue to receive all system emails (e.g.\nthose regarding forgotten user passwords) and legal notices (e.g.\nupdates to our policies) from us unless you terminate your registration with 500px.</p>\n<br>\n<p>As explained earlier, the \"help\" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.\nPlease note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>You can choose not to share information with us, but your experience of the site may be limited.\nHowever, until your account is deleted, you may receive all system emails.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Children Under 18 Years of Age</p>\n<p>You must be 14 years and older to register to use the 500px website.\nAs a result, 500px does not specifically collect information about children.\nIf we learn that 500px has collected information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nWe recommend that minors between the ages of 14 and 18 ask and receive permission from a legal guardian before using 500px or sending information about themselves or anyone else over the Internet.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>Please register only when you reach 18 years of age, or ask for permission from a legal guardian if you are between 14 and 18 years old.\nYou are not allowed to register if you are under 14.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Changes to This Privacy Policy</p>\n<p>500px may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion.\nUse of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.\nIf we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the 500px website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Basically,</p>\n<p>The Privacy Policy may change.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Conditions of Use</p>\n<p>If you decide to visit 500px website, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including
