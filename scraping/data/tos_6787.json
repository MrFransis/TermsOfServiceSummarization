accounts, to complete your transactions, to create and offer you products and services you might be interested in, to personalize and improve upon your experience with us and to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements.</p>\nNon-Identifying Information\n<p>We may collect information from your visit or as part of the registration and administration of your account, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, such as, without limitation, age and individual preferences (\u201cNon-Identifying Information\u201d).</p>\nCookies\n<p>The Services may place \u201cCookies\u201d on a visitor\u2019s device.\nCookies are small text files.\nOur Cookies save anonymized data about individual visitors, allowing our Services to recognize information about a visitor and help deliver personalized content and other services and functions.\nCookies make your Internet experience quicker and more convenient.\nThe Services use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user\u2019s device until they expire or are manually deleted.\nThe Services also contain coding from our business and technology partners which generates third party cookies.\nThird party cookies allow our business and technology partners to store non-Identifying Information they can access when you visit this or other websites.\nAccepting a cookie from a web or device browser may give us access to Personally Identifiable Information for analytics purposes.</p>\n<p>Most website and mobile device browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and provide the ability to remove them.\nYou may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.\nBlocking cookies may result in a lower quality experience for you while you are using our Services.</p>\nDevice and Connection Information\n<p>When you use our Services, we will identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device.\nThe IP address does not identify you personally, but it lets us identify the device you are using.\nWe store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes.\nWe may also collect other device-specific information about the device you are using, including what type of device it is and hardware model, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identified, geo-location data, and crash data.\nWhether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.\nCheck the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider to learn more about what information your device makes available to us.</p>\nWeb Beacons (1\u00d71 Pixels or GIFS)\n<p>Our Services may contain coding known as Web Beacons that use 1\u00d71 pixel images to capture and transmit the online activity of users on our Services.\nThese Web Beacons typically transmit information about form completions and other activities in order to measure advertising effectiveness or store analytics information.\nIn addition, we may use Web Beacons in HTML-based emails.\nThis allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of our email communications and our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened.</p>\nLog Files\n<p>Like most websites, our servers utilize log files.\nLog files store information including internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.\nLog files are used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track Users\u2019 movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.\nWe use log file information at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses our website.</p>\nGoogle Analytics Feature\n<p>We may use Google Analytics to collect information about the use of the Website.\nGoogle Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Website.\nWe use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve the Website.\nGoogle Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, rather than your name or other identifying information.\nWe do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with Personally Identifiable Information.\nAlthough Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.\nGoogle\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.\nYou can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Website by disabling the Google Analytics cookie on your browser.\nYou can also view and change the currently available opt-outs for Google Ads.</p>\nOther Analytics Tools\n<p>In addition to or in lieu of Google Analytics, we may use other similar web analytics tools to collect information about our Website.\nRegardless of the tool selected, we use this information only to improve the Website.\nAny analytics tools we use collect the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Website, your name and email address.\nWe only use analytics tools that are GDPR-compliant and that meet our auditing and privacy standards.</p>\nGoogle Drive\n<p>If you choose to link your Google Drive account to a Nelnet Campus Commerce product for easy access to your files, Nelnet Campus Commerce will use Google\u2019s OAuth protocols to establish that connection.\nNelnet Campus Commerce will not use this information in any manner inconsistent with this policy or for any purpose other than allowing you access to your Google Drive.\nNelnet Campus Commerce will not read, edit, delete, or copy files or information without your permission or as instructed by you.\nYou may disconnect Nelnet Campus Commerce\u2019s site or application at any time by removing access through your Google account.</p>\nDo Not Track Signals\n<p>Do Not Track is a feature in your web browser, which enables you to opt-out of the third party tracking of your online activities over time and across third party websites.\nWe do not track users across third party websites to provide targeted advertising, and therefore, do not process or comply with any web browser\u2019s \u201cdo not track\u201d signal or other similar mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individual users who visit this Website or use our Services.\nThird parties cannot collect any Personally Identifiable Information from this Website unless you provide it to them directly.</p>\nPersonally Identifying Information\n<p>We may collect Nonpublic Personal Information about you from the following sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Information from this Website or paper forms</li>\n<li>Information about your transactions with us or others</li>\n<li>Information we

collected by us and maintained in an accessible form.</p>\n<strong>How We Use Your Information</strong>\nUses of Information\n<p>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personally Identifiable Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.\nBut the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences).\nWe may combine your Personally Identifiable Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Website and Services are used.\nWe may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>\n<p>If you supply us with your e-mail address, we may let you know by e-mail about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you.\nYou will have the opportunity to tell us you do not want to receive future messages with each message you receive.\nIf you e-mail a question or comment to us, we will use your e-mail address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your e-mail address, your message, and our reply for quality assurance or to

wish to change any of your personal information, you may change it by logging into your account.\nby contacting Customer Service, either through email, mail, or telephone.\nor by contacting your Educational Institution.</p>\nWhat We Share\n<p>We do not sell personal information to third parties.\nAll personal information collected is used by us or our affiliates to perform services, comply with laws or carry out internal functions.</p>\n<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Website-related Services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website\u2019s features) to assist us in analyzing how our Website and Services are used, or to perform other services (e.g., without limitation, sending postal mail and email, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service).\nThese third parties have access to your Nonpublic Personal Information, Nonpublic Personal Information, and/or Personally Identifiable Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.\nprovided, however, that if you are redirected to a site or application maintained by a third party, the privacy policy of such site or application will control the use of any information you provide.</p>\n<p>We may share your information with companies that are affiliated with us, such as our direct or indirect subsidiaries or parent or sister companies.\nAs we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell companies, subsidiaries,
