Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.\nShould we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.\nThe Company may change this policy from time to time by updating this page.\nPlease take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and contact us if you have any questions.</p>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION<p>You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with the Company or its affiliated.\nThe Company and its affiliated may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nThey may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.\nYou are not required to provide the personal information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.</p>WHAT WE COLLECT<p>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified.\nIt does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).\nWe may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Identity Data&nbsp;</strong>includes first name, last name, username or similar identifier, date of birth and gender.\nFor some services, we also collect information in relation to your nationality, passport number, passport expiry, Emirates ID and Emirates ID expiry.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Contact Data&nbsp;</strong>includes billing address, delivery address, email address and telephone numbers.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Financial Data&nbsp;</strong>includes bank account and payment card details.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Transaction Data&nbsp;</strong>includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products and

your username and password, purchases or orders made by you, your interests, preferences, feedback and survey responses.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Data&nbsp;</strong>includes information about how you use our website, products and services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Marketing and Communications Data&nbsp;</strong>includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties and your communication preferences.\nWe may periodically send promotional emails about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting using the email address which you have provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes.\nWe may contact you by email, phone or mail.\nWe also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual (\u201cAggregated Data\u201d).\nWe may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.\nThe following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, referrer URL, location, and the time zone where the Company or affiliates\u2019 product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</li>\n<li>We may collect information regarding customer activities on our website and from our other products and services.\nThis information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest.\nAggregated data is considered non\u2011personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries.\nThis information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.\nExcept in limited instances to ensure quality of our services over the Internet, such information will not be associated with your IP

personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>SECURITY<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure.\nIn order to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>HOW WE USE COOKIES<p>A \u201ccookie\u201d is a string of information which assigns you a unique identifier that we store on your computer.\nYour browser then provides that unique identifier
