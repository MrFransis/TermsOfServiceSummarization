Statement \u2022 Slashdot Media</p>\n<p>LAST UPDATED: January 06, 2020</p>\n<p>Like many websites, our Services (as defined in our Privacy Policy) use \u201ccookies\u201d and other small files (as further described below) to help us customize your experience, analyze our web traffic, and improve our offerings.\nThese cookies distinguish you from other users of our Services.\nWebsites are now required to obtain explicit consent when using or storing cookies (or similar technologies) on your computer or mobile device if you are located in the European Union.\nThis policy intends to provide our visitors with clear and comprehensive information about the cookies we use and the purposes for using those cookies.\nFor more information on how we use your personal information, see our Privacy Policy.\nThis Policy is incorporated into and part of our Privacy Policy.\nDefined terms that are not defined within this Cookie Statement shall have the definition provided within the Privacy Policy.\nWhen you visit or interact with the Services we or our authorized providers may use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies for storing information to help provide you with a good experience when you browse our Sites and also allow us to improve our Sites.\nHere is information to help you understand these technologies better.</p>1.\nWhat are cookies, web beacons and similar technologies?<p>Cookies are small data files that are stored by the web browser (for example, Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Safari) on your computer, mobile device, tablet, or other internet-enabled device (referred to collectively as a \u201cDevice\u201d).\nCookies allow a web server to transfer data to a device for recordkeeping and other purposes.\nThey allow websites to store things like user preferences.\nYou can think of cookies as providing a \u2018memory\u2019 for the website, so that it can recognize you when you come back and respond appropriately.\nThese cookies allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Sites and the Services.</p>2.\nWhat types of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies do we use?<p>Our use of such technologies fall into the following general categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Strictly necessary</strong> \u2013 these are cookies, web beacons or other similar technologies that are required for the operation of our Sites.\nThey include, for example, technologies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Sites, use a shopping cart, or make use of e-billing services.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Analytical/performance</strong> \u2013 They allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors to our Sites and to see how visitors move around our Sites.\nThis helps us to improve the way our Sites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Functionality</strong>\u2013 These are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites, which enables us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising or targeting-related</strong>\u2013 These technologies record your visit to the Sites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.\nWe will use this information to make our Sites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests.\nWe may repurpose or retarget the information we gather about you, We may also share this information with our advertisers, lead buyers, and with third parties for advertising and retargeting purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can find more information about the individual cookies, web beacons and similar technologies and the purposes for which we use them below.\nThis list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate the primary reasons for certain types of cookies set by Slashdot Media or third parties on our Sites.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pixels</strong> \u2013 We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.\nThese pixels are provided by our ad management partners, including DoubleClick, or other advertising networks and advertisers.\nThese files enable our ad management partner to recognize a unique cookie on your Internet browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our Sites.\nThe information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.\nIt does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.\nFor more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to https://www.google.com/privacy/ads/ or you may also opt out by clicking here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Framing</strong> \u2013 The Sites may utilize framing and masking techniques to make it appear that the user is still a Site when the user is actually on a third party website.\nWe also have co-branding relationships with certain partners, such as at deals.slashdot.org.\nIn these relationships, you will find our service platform on our partner\u2019s page.\nIn this situation, both parties are collecting your data and both privacy policies govern the data collected.\nWe will not share your data with our partner or other third parties without your consent in these and other relationships, nor do our partners share your data with us without your consent.\nWe encourage you to be aware when you leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information from you.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Web beacons</strong>\u2013 We use web beacons from time to time.\nA web beacon is a string of code that provides a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data, or determining how many times a specific web page has been viewed.\nWeb beacons enable us to recognize a browser\u2019s cookie when a browser visits a Site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to each Site.\nFor example, when a user visits a web page, the code for the page may include instructions to go to another server to gather a single pixel graphic image.\nWeb beacons are not placed on a user\u2019s computer.\nSuch web beacons may be placed on our Sites by our third party advertising companies to help manage and optimize any online advertising, and by third party data companies to share our users\u2019 behavior profile with third parties.\nTo opt out of targeted advertising delivered by Network Advertising Initiative members, click here: https://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Browser and Flash Cookies</strong>\u2013 We may use browser and Flash cookies, local Storage, or other similar technologies from time to time on the Sites.\nA \u201cbrowser\u201d or \u201cHTTP\u201d cookie is a unique text file that may be used for data analysis, and enables a web site to tailor information presented to a user based on a user\u2019s browsing program.\nWe may use browser cookies to personalize a user\u2019s pages at a Site or Sites, to remember a user when the user registers for products or services, for fraud prevention, or to track visits to a Site or across our Sites.\nWe also may use Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our Sites to personalize your visit.\nThird parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Sites or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use Flash cookies to collect and store information.\nFlash cookies are different from \u201cbrowser\u201d cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.\nCookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.\nTo learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, including how to delete Flash cookies, click here for additional information: https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118.\nSee Sections 3 and 4 below for more on how to disable cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ads</strong> \u2013 The ads appearing on the Sites may be delivered to visitors by third parties, such as Google.\nThe third party advertising technology that we use on the Sites uses information derived from a user\u2019s visits to the Sites to target advertising within the Sites.\nIn addition, our advertisers may use other third party advertising technology to target advertising on the Sites.\nIn the course of serving advertisements to the Sites, our partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on a user\u2019s browser.\nInformation about users\u2019 visits to the Sites, such as the number of times users have viewed an ad (but not users\u2019 names or addresses), are used to serve ads to visitors.\nThe use of cookies enables our partners to serve ads to users based on such user\u2019s visit to our Sites and other sites on the Internet.\nAs with other cookies, and consistent with our policy on cookies stated above, the user may block or delete such cookies from the user\u2019s drive or memory.\nFor more information about Google, Google\u2019s use of cookies, and how to \u201copt out\u201d of Google\u2019s email/information lists, please click see here and here.\nAs noted in the Web Beacon discussion above, users also can opt-out of receiving these types of targeted network advertisements from many advertising networks as detailed below.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.\nYou will continue to receive generic ads.</li>\n</ul>3.\nHow to manage cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our Sites<p>There are a number of ways you can manage what Analytical/performance, Functionality and Advertising/targeting-related cookies are set on your Device.\nStrictly necessary cookies, however, cannot be disabled.\nYou may also be required to re-enter your password more frequently during your browsing session.\nThe first time you visit any of our Sites you will see an overlay which explains that by continuing to browse the relevant Site or clicking \u201cI Agree\u201d you are deemed to give your consent to use these cookies as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>4.\nCan I withdraw my consent?<p>Once you have given us your consent to the use of cookies, we store a cookie on your computer or device to remember this for next time.\nYour consent will expire periodically.\nIf you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, you will need to delete your cookies using your internet browser settings, or if you are in the European Union, you will have the option to use our Consent Management Provider[Cookie Preference Tool \u2013 Change this to whatever you are calling the pop-up box for cookies], as described below.</p>5.\nEU Users: How can I exercise my cookie preferences?<p>You can exercise your cookie preferences by visiting the Consent Management Provider.\nThis functionality is available to users in the EU only.\nFor further information about deleting or blocking cookies, please visit:

that choice, please go to our Cookie Preference Manager to receive an opt-out cookie.</p>7.\nDisabling most targeting or behavior advertising cookies.<p>If you would like to disable advertising cookies, which remember your browsing habits and display relevant advertising when you use our SourceForge Services, you can visit https://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices.\nIf you choose to turn off these cookies you will still see advertising on the Internet but it may not be tailored to your interests.\nIt does not mean that you won\u2019t be served any advertisements while you are online.\nAlthough many companies involved in using advertising cookies and serving online behavioral advertising appear at the above links, not all do.\nTherefore, even if you choose to turn off cookies used by all of the companies listed, you may still receive some advertising cookies and some tailored advertisements from other companies.\nCookies Chart available here</p>\n<p>Log
