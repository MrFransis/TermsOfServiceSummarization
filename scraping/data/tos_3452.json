register on our website, four categories of data to and on behalf of you will be processed:</p>\n\u201cAccount data\u201d\n<p>When you register for an account on our site, place an order, subscribe to our newsletter or respond to a survey, basic contact details are collected such as the e-mail address and name of your contact person, company name, address, phone number, VAT number, preferred language and currency, any purchase order number, any e-mail address of invoice receivers and masked credit card or bank account details.</p>\n\u201cConfiguration data\u201d\n<p>We collect your direct input to our cloud service Cookiebot Consent Management Platform (the \u201c<strong>Service</strong>\u201d) after login, like the domain name(s) of the website(s) where you implement the Service and configuration of the content, looks and behavior towards website visitors (\u201c<strong>End Users</strong>\u201d).</p>\n\u201cEnd User Data\u201d\n<p>Data generated by End Users browsing your website(s) using the Service.\nWhen an End User submits a consent from your website(s), the following data are automatically logged at Cybot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The End User\u2019s IP number in anonymized form (last three digits are set to \u20180\u2019).</li>\n<li>The date and time of the consent.</li>\n<li>User agent of the End User\u2019s browser.</li>\n<li>The URL from which the consent was submitted.</li>\n<li>An anonymous, random and encrypted key value.</li>\n<li>The End User\u2019s consent state, serving as proof of consent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The key and consent state are also saved in the End User\u2019s browser in the first party cookie \u201c<em>CookieConsent</em>\u201d so that the website can automatically read and respect the End User\u2019s consent on all subsequent page requests and future End User sessions for up to 12 months.\nThe key is used for proof of consent and an option to verify that the consent state stored in the End User\u2019s browser is unaltered compared to the original consent submitted to Cybot.</p>\n<p>If you activate the Service feature \u201c<em>bulk consent</em>\u201d to enable consent for multiple websites by a single End User submission, the Service will also store a separate random, unique ID with the End User\u2019s consent.\nIf all of the following criteria are met, this key will be stored in an encrypted form in

types of data, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subscription data, like start date, latest invoice date and the result of a mandatory VAT number validation.\nIssued invoices are stored so that you may access any issued invoices from within the Service Manager.</li>\n<li>Definitions of the cookies found when the Service has scanned your website(s), including reports on the result of each scan.</li>\n<li>Aggregated statistical data on End User consents.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You can issue instructions to Cybot through configuration and/or execution of relevant functions offered by

Protection Act Compliance\n<p>Because Cybot values your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act.\nWe therefore will not distribute any personal information to outside parties without your consent except as stated in clause 7.</p>\n<p>As part of the California Online Privacy Protection Act, all users of our website may make any changes to their information at any time by logging into their account and navigating to the \u201cprofile page\u201d.</p>\n4.3.\nChildren\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance\n<p>Cybot is in compliance with the requirements of the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act.\nWe will not intentionally collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age.\nOur website, products and services are all directed at people who are at least 13 years old or older.</p>\n5.\nHow do we protect your information? <p>Cybot implements the following technical, physical and organizational measures to maintain the safety of your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized use, unauthorized modification, disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing.</p>\n5.1.\nAvailability\n<p>The Service utilizes the extensive features of the cloud environment to ensure high availability, like full redundancy, load balancing, automatic capacity scaling, continuous data backup and geo-replication along with a traffic manager for automatic geographical failover on datacenter level disasters.\nAll failover mechanisms are fully automated.</p>\n<p>No personal data is stored permanently outside Cybot\u2019s cloud platforms.\nThe physical security is thereby maintained by Cybot\u2019s subcontractors, see clause 7.\nMicrosoft\u2019s datacenters comply with industry standards such as ISO 27001 for physical security and availability, e.g.\nby using security staff around the clock, two-factor access control using biometric and card readers, barriers, fencing, security cameras and other measures.</p>\n5.2.\nIntegrity\n<p>To ensure integrity, all data transits are encrypted to align with best practices for protecting confidentiality and data integrity.\nE.g.\nall supplied credit card information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway provider\u2019s database only to be accessible by those who are authorized to access such systems and who are required to keep the information confidential.</p>\n<p>For data in transit, the Service uses industry-standard transport protocols between devices and Microsoft datacenters and within datacenters themselves.</p>\n5.3.\nConfidentiality\n<p>All personnel are subject to full confidentiality and any subcontractors and subprocessors are required to sign a confidentiality agreement if not full confidentiality is part of the main agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p>Whenever personal data is accessed by authorized personnel the access is only possible over an encrypted connection.\nWhen accessing the data in a database, the IP number of the person accessing the data must also be pre-authorized to obtain access.</p>\n<p>Any device being used to access personal data is login protected by Cybot\u2019s Azure Active Directory (AAD), Microsoft\u2019s cloud based identity and access management service, and has Cybot\u2019s corporate antivirus solution installed.\nIf any personal data are temporarily stored on a device, the storage unit on the device must also be strongly encrypted.</p>\n<p>On premise devices storing personal data temporarily is at all times, except when not being actively used or relocated under uninterrupted supervision, locked in a safe.\nPersonal data are never stored on mobile media like USB sticks and DVD\u2019s.</p>\n5.4.\nTransparency\n<p>Cybot will at all times keep you informed about changes to the processes to protect data privacy and security, including practices and policies.\nYou may at any time request information on where and how data is stored, secured and used.\nCybot will also provide the summaries of any independent audits of the Service.</p>\n5.5.\nIsolation\n<p>All access to personal data is blocked by default, using a zero privileges policy.\nAccess to personal data is restricted to individually authorized personnel.\nCybot\u2019s Security and Privacy Officer issues authorizations and maintains a log of granted authorizations.\nAuthorized personnel are granted a minimum access on a need-to-have basis through our AAD.</p>\n5.6.\nThe ability to intervene\n<p>Cybot enables your rights of access, rectification, erasure, blocking and objection mainly by providing built-in functions for data handling in the Service Manager, by offering the option to send instructions through Cybot\u2019s helpdesk and also by informing about and offering the customer the possibility of objection when Cybot is planning to implement changes to relevant practices and policies.</p>\n<p>The overall responsibility for data security lies with Cybot\u2019s Data Protection Officer who educates and updates all personnel on the data security measures outlined in Cybot\u2019s security handbook and this Privacy Policy.</p>\n5.7.\nMonitoring\n<p>Cybot uses security reports to monitor access patterns and to proactively identify and mitigate potential threats.\nAdministrative operations, including system access, are logged to provide an audit trail if unauthorized or accidental changes are made.</p>\n<p>System performance and availability is monitored from both internal and external monitoring services.</p>\n5.8.\nPersonal Data breach notification\n<p>In the event that your data is compromised, Cybot will notify you and competent Supervisory Authority(ies) within 72 hours by e-mail with information about the extent of the breach, affected data, any impact on the Service and Cybot's action plan for measures to secure the data and limit any possible detrimental effect on the data subjects.</p>\n<p>\"Personal data breach\" means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed in connection with the provision of the Service.</p>\n6.\nHow we use cookies <p>See Cybot\u2019s Cookie Declaration at www.cookiebot.com/en/cookie-declaration for information on the cookies we use.</p>\n7.\nDo we disclose any information to outside parties? <p>Cybot does not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties any personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>This does not include trusted third parties or subcontractors who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you.\nSuch trusted parties may have access to personally identifiable information on a need-to-know basis and will be contractually obliged to keep your information confidential.</p>\n<p>We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect our or others\u2019 rights, property, or safety.\nFurthermore, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>\n7.1.\nSubcontractors/trusted third parties\n<p>The subcontractors Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd, Dublin, Ireland and Fujitsu A/S, Ballerup, Denmark are following and being audited against the standards of ISO/IEC 27001.\nThe main subcontractor Microsoft has also adopted the international code of practice for cloud privacy, ISO/IEC 27018.\nThe subprocessor E-conomic International A/S is certified in \u201cInternational Standards on Assurance Engagements 3000\u201d (ISAE 3000).</p>\n<p>Cybot will monitor subcontractors\u2019 and subprocessors\u2019 maintenance of these standards and audits to ensure that data protection requirements are fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of subcontractors or subprocessors handling personal data will be announced to you with at least 3 months\u2019 notice.\nYou retain at all times the possibility to object to such changes or to terminate the contract with Cybot.</p>\n7.2 Legally required disclosure\n<p>Cybot will not disclose the customer\u2019s data to law enforcement except when instructed by you or where it is required by law.\nWhen governments make a lawful demand for customer data from Cybot, Cybot strives to limit the disclosure.\nCybot will only release specific data mandated by the relevant legal demand.</p>\n<p>If compelled to disclose your data, Cybot will promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand unless legally prohibited from doing so.</p>\n8.\nThird party links <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website.\nThese third party sites have separate independent privacy policies.\nWe therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked websites.\nNonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our website and welcome any feedback about these websites.</p>\n9.\nWhere do we store the information? <p>No stored data will be transferred, backed up and/or recovered by Cybot outside of the European Union.</p>\n9.1.\nPersonal data location\n<p>All data are stored in databases and file repositories hosted in an Azure data center at Cybot's cloud vendor, Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd in

A/S.</p>\n9.2.\nInstallation of software on cloud customer\u2019s system\n<p>No installation of software is required to use the Service.\nThe login-protected Service Manager is accessible through a standard web browser, automatically using an encrypted https-connection for all communications between your browser and Cybot\u2019s server to protect any data from being intercepted during network transfers.</p>\n10.\nAccess, data portability, migration, and transfer back assistance <p>You may at any time obtain confirmation from Cybot as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed.</p>\n<p>You may at any time order a complete data copy, which you may transmit to another controller of the data.\nYour data will be delivered within 10 working days by Cybot as spreadsheet files in Microsoft Excel-format.\nLogical relations between datasets will be preserved in form of unique identifiers.\nYou are required to pay \u20ac1,000 + any applicable taxes on delivery for each

our website cookiebot.com.\nBy accepting these Terms, either by clicking a box indicating your acceptance or by executing an order form or other document referring to these Terms, you agree that these Terms form part of the agreement between you and Cybot A/S (\u201c<strong>Cybot</strong>\u201d) (the \u201c<strong>Agreement</strong>\u201d).</p>\n<p>1.2.\nThese Terms were last updated on March 16, 2018 and are effective between you and Cybot as of the date when you place an order or set up an account at cookiebot.com.\nCybot reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time.\nIf such changes are considered material, Cybot will inform registered customers about the changes by email, and the changes will take effect one month after such emails have been sent.\nYour continued use of our website or services after such changes will constitute acknowledgment and acceptance of the modified Terms.</p>\n<p>1.3.\nIn case of any discrepancies between the wording of our website and these Terms, these Terms prevail.</p>\n<p>1.4.\nThese Terms as well as all other texts throughout the website are translated from English to other languages.\nThese are unofficial translations and are only provided as convenience translations.\nThey should therefore be interpreted in accordance with their English language versions which will prevail in the event of any discrepancy between the English version and the translation.\nCybot assumes no liability for any errors, omissions or ambiguities in the translations.\nAny person or entity choosing to rely on the translated content does so at their own risk.\nWhen in doubt, please always refer to the official English language version.</p>\nThe Services We Deliver \u2013 and What You Need to Do 2.1.\nEU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and EU\u2019s ePrivacy Directive 2009/136/EC (ePR) test\n<p>2.1.1.\nCybot offers a free GDPR/ePR test which analyzes your website to give you an indication of whether or not your website is compliant with the rules relating to online tracking set out in the GDPR and ePR.</p>\n<p>2.1.2.\nThe GDPR/ePR test is only based on some basic requirements in the GDPR and ePR and is furthermore only an analysis of up to 5 subpages of your website.\nIt is therefore not a complete analysis of your website.\nTherefore, a positive test response must not be taken as a guarantee that your website fulfills all requirements set out in the GDPR and ePR.</p>\n<p>2.1.3.\nThe Disclaimer of Warranty as set out in clause 9 and the Limitation of Liability as set out in clause 10 also apply to the use of the GDPR/ePR test.</p>\n<p>2.1.4.\nIf you wish to perform a complete analysis of your website, you must sign up for a Cookiebot CMP subscription, cf.\nclause 2.2.</p>\n2.2.\nCookiebot CMP Subscription\n<p>2.2.1.\nSubject to the sign-up procedure on our website and payment of the Subscription Fee (as defined in clause 3.1 below), Cybot will deliver to you the services (\u201c<strong>Cookiebot CMP</strong>\u201d) described on our website.</p>\n<p>2.2.2.\nCookiebot Consent Management Platform (CMP) is designed as a service to facilitate compliance with EU regulations concerning the use of cookies on your website and to help you obtain the relevant consents to the use of cookies from the users of your website.\nCybot is only the service provider of the IT infrastructure, and it is your own responsibility to ensure correct implementation and provide relevant input to the system, including drafting an appropriate wording of the request for consents and providing the necessary information to the users of your website in order to obtain an \u201cinformed\u201d, \u201cprior\u201d and \u201cimplied\u201d or \u201cexplicit\u201d consent as appropriate.\nThe relevant EU legislation is not necessarily implemented in the same way in all EU countries, and we cannot guarantee that using Cookiebot CMP will automatically lead to compliance with all relevant rules and regulations concerning the use of cookies or the collection of consents to the use of cookies.\nWe encourage you to seek local legal advice to ensure compliance with local legislation when implementing the solution on your website and to tailor the wording of the consents to be shown on your website.</p>\n<p>2.2.3.\nIf you own multiple websites, Cookiebot CMP can ask your users for a consent that covers all your domains (a \u201c<strong>Bulk Consent</strong>\u201d) on the user\u2019s first visit to any of your websites.\nYou must guarantee that you are the rightful owner of all domains listed on Cookiebot CMP\u2019s \u201cdomain list\u201d or that you otherwise have the necessary rights to include such websites on the \u201cdomain list\u201d.\nThe functionality of the Bulk Consent is dependent on the user\u2019s acceptance of third-party cookies in the web browser used to access your website.</p>\n<p>2.2.4.\nIf you use Cookiebot CMP to exempt specific strictly necessary cookies in case a user declines the use of cookies, it is your responsibility to ensure that such cookies are strictly necessary to enable the basic functionality that the user actively seeks on your website in accordance with current legislation.</p>\n<p>2.2.5.\nCookiebot CMP itself automatically sets up to two cookies in the user\u2019s web browser when the user visits your website: The first-party cookie \u201cCookieConsent\u201d which stores the user\u2019s consent and \u2013 if you enable \u201cBulk Consent\u201d in Cookiebot CMP \u2013 the third-party cookie \u201cCookieConsentBulkTicket\u201d which stores an encrypted key to enable Bulk Consent across your domains as described in clause 2.2.3 above.\nBoth cookies expire automatically for renewal after 12 months from the date of the user\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p>2.2.6.\nA user may withdraw a consent at any time by deleting the two cookies mentioned in clause 2.2.5.\nAlternatively, a user can change a consent at any time by clicking a link that activates Cookiebot CMP\u2019s \u201crenew\u201d method as described at cookiebot.com/en/developer.\nThis functionality requires that you insert a link to the method from your website, e.g.\nfrom your website privacy policy, or implement Cookiebot CMP\u2019s cookie declaration which contains the appropriate link for consent renewal.</p>\n<p>2.2.7.\nA user consent is logged and documented by registration of the user\u2019s anonymized IP number, browser user agent, website URL, date and time of consent and a unique, encrypted key that is stored in a data center with Cybot\u2019s cloud vendor, Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd in Dublin, Ireland.\nYou may download a copy of the consent log from the Cookiebot Manager after which it is your own responsibility to handle the log copy data in accordance with current legislation.\nAfter 12 months, the consent is automatically deleted from our log and then used only in an aggregated, anonymized form as part of the statistics that you have access to in Cookiebot CMP.</p>\n<p>2.2.8.\nIf your subscription is managed by an authorized Cookiebot CMP reseller, the reseller will have access to collected data and configurations when managing your subscription, but the reseller has no right to share, use or sell the collected data and configurations.\nCollected data and configurations will not be shared with or sold to other third parties by Cybot.</p>\n<p>2.3.\nCybot is the data processor and acts only on instruction by you as the data controller.\nCybot takes the appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and against unauthorized disclosure, misuse or illegal processing.\nCybot is subject to the safeguards provided for in the legislation of Denmark, where the company is established.</p>\n<p>2.4.\nCybot organizes its resources to provide a high level of service with at least 99.9% uptime on the operation of the cloud service and a response time of less than 1 business day for critical support requests (blocking event) and 10 business days for non-critical support requests (non-blocking event).</p>\n<p>2.5.\nCookiebot CMP is a self-serve service.\nAs a customer, you can submit questions, comments or suggestions using the helpdesk at cookiebot.com/en/helpdesk.\nIf you are dissatisfied with the service provided, please contact Cybot.\nIf the case cannot be resolved, you can use the European Commission\u2019s online complaint portal at ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.</p>\n3.\nPrices 3.1.\nCookiebot CMP Subscription\n<p>3.1.1.\nAll the following subscriptions will include monthly website scans, consent banner and cookie declaration on your website as well as a consent log and tracking reports for documentation and frontend API for easy implementation.</p>\n<p>3.1.2.\nCurrent prices can be found at cookiebot.com/en/pricing.</p>\n<p>3.1.3.\nThe prices may be changed by Cybot at any time subject to 90 days\u2019 notice which will be sent to you by email if you have registered a user account on our

these types of domains.</p>\n<p>3.1.4.3.\nYou can change the scan frequency for a domain from \u201cmonthly\u201d to \u201cdaily\u201d for an extra fee, as set out in clause 3.1.2.</p>\n<p>3.1.5.\nTrial Version</p>\n<p>3.1.5.1.\nIf you sign up for a trial version of Cookiebot CMP, you may use the service free of charge for 30 days.\nThe trial version allows access to all functions of Cookiebot CMP except manual domain scans.\nIn addition, the number of domains is limited to 10, and the number of pages being scanned is limited to 100 per domain.</p>\n<p>3.1.6.\nFree Subscription</p>\n<p>3.1.6.1.\nIf your domain contains 100 pages or less, you can sign up for a Free subscription, which is free of charge.\nYou can only sign up for the Free Subscription for one domain.</p>\n<p>3.1.6.2.\nThe Free Subscription does not include the functions mentioned in clause 3.1.4.1.</p>\n<p>3.1.6.3.\nThe Free Subscription will be automatically upgraded to a trial version if a scan of your domain shows that it contains more than 100 pages.\nYou will be notified of such upgrade by email.</p>\n4.\nPayment and Invoicing <p>4.1.\nSubscriptions are billed monthly in arrears or yearly in advance and are payable by bank transfer or credit card.\nYou must provide us with valid and updated credit card information when signing up for Cookiebot CMP with your credit card.\nYou

the yearly payment term will be billed separately to align the billing cycle for the additional domain and your other domain(s).</p>\n<p>4.5.\nAfter each monthly domain scan, Cookiebot CMP will automatically fix the size of the next subscription fee for each domain name based on the number of subpages found.</p>\n<p>4.6.\nWhether the subscription fee is paid by bank transfer or credit card, invoices will be sent to the email address registered on your Cookiebot CMP account.\nWhen you log into Cookiebot CMP, you can view and download invoices issued to you under the \u201cMy account\u201d
