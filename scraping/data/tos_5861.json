receive following our guidelines for Reporting Copyright Violations, we may (1) remove Your Data from the Hosted Products or (2) suspend your access to the Hosted Products.\nWe will use reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of removals and suspensions when practicable, but if we determine that your actions endanger the operation of the Hosted Products or other users, we may suspend your access or remove Your Data immediately without notice.\nWe have no liability to you for removing or deleting Your Data from or suspending your access to any Hosted Products as described in this Section 6.4.4.</p> 6.4.5 No Prohibited Sensitive Personal Information <p>You will not submit to the Hosted Products (or use the Hosted Products to collect) any Sensitive Personal

legislation.\n(ii) patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by HIPAA.\n(iii) credit, debit or other payment card data subject to PCI DSS.\n(iv) other personal information

Refunds</strong>.\nYou may cancel your Sejda paid account at any time.\nRefunds are only issued if required by law.\nFor example, users living in the European Union have the right to cancel their paid account subscriptions within 14 days of signing up for, upgrading to, or renewing a paid account.</p>\n<p>In the context of Software, a refund means that we will disable the license key that allowed the Software to operate.\nIn the context of Hosted Services, a refund means that we will disable access to the Hosted Service.</p> 7.2 Delivery <p>We will deliver the applicable license keys (in the case of Software) via your account page.\nWe will deliver login instructions (in the case of Hosted Services) to the email addresses specified in your Order when we have received payment of the applicable fees.\nAll deliveries under this Agreement will be electronic.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, you are responsible for installation of any Software, and you acknowledge that Sejda has no further delivery obligation with respect to the Software after delivery of the license keys.</p> 7.3 Payment <p>You agree to pay all fees in accordance with each Order.\nUnless otherwise specified in your Order, you will pay all amounts in U.S.\ndollars at the time you place your Order.\nOther than as expressly set forth in Section 7.1 (Refund Policy), all amounts are non-refundable, non-cancelable and non-creditable.\nIn making payments, you acknowledge that you are not relying on future availability of any Products beyond the current License Term or Subscription Term or any Product upgrades or feature enhancements.\nIf you add Authorized Users during your License Term or Subscription Term, we will charge you for the increased number of Authorized Users pursuant to the then-currently applicable rates in your next billing cycle.\nYou agree that we may bill your credit card for renewals, additional users, and unpaid fees, as applicable.</p> 7.4 Taxes <p>Our prices include EU VAT, if applicable.</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, your payments under this Agreement exclude any taxes or duties payable in respect of the Products in the jurisdiction where the payment is either made or received.\nTo the extent that any such taxes or duties are payable by Sejda, you must pay to Sejda the amount of such taxes or duties in addition to any fees owed under this Agreement.</p> 7.5 Credit card information <p>If you do not notify us of updates to your payment method, to avoid interruption of your service, we may participate in programs supported by your card provider to try to update your payment information, and you authorize us to continue billing your account with the updated information that we obtain.</p> 7.6 Chargebacks <p>Sejda has a zero tolerance policy for chargebacks.\nAny customer who disputes a credit card payment that is found to be valid will be permanently banned from using the Service.</p> 8.\nNo-Charge Products <p>We offer certain Products to you at no charge, including free services and accounts, trial use, and access to Beta Versions as defined below (\"<strong>No-Charge Products</strong>\").\nYour use of No-Charge Products is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted for the period designated by us.\nWe may terminate your right to use No-Charge Products at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion, without liability to you.\nYou understand that any pre-release and beta products we make available (\"<strong>Beta Versions</strong>\") are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete and are likely to contain more errors and bugs than generally available Products.\nWe make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available.\nIn some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section 8 (No-Charge Products).\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any warranty, and indemnity obligations.</p> 9.\nRestrictions <p>Except as otherwise expressly permitted in this Agreement, you will not: (a) rent, lease, reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works of, distribute, sell, sublicense, transfer, or provide access to the Products to a third party, (b) use the Products for the benefit of any third party, (c) incorporate any Products into a product or service you provide to a third party, (d) interfere with any license

development purposes.</p> 10.\nLicense Certifications <p>At our request, you agree to provide a signed certification that you are using all Products pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including the Scope of Use.</p> 11.\nOwnership and Feedback <p>Products are made available on a limited license or access basis, and no ownership right is conveyed to you, irrespective of the use of terms such as \"purchase\" or \"sale\".\nSejda and its licensors have and retain all right, title and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the Products (including all No-Charge Products), their \"look and feel\", any and all related or underlying technology, and any modifications or derivative works of the foregoing created by or for Sejda, including without limitation as they may incorporate Feedback (\"Sejda Technology\").\nFrom time to time, you may choose to submit comments, information, questions, data, ideas, description of processes, or other information to Sejda, including sharing your modifications or in the course of receiving support and maintenance (\"Feedback\").\nSejda may in connection with any of its products or services freely use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise.\nNo Feedback will be considered your Confidential Information, and nothing in this Agreement limits Sejda's right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.</p>

law).\n(e) we asses that the fraud risk associated with your payment is high (we will not notify you in advance in this case).\n(f) we detect abuse or excessively frequent use of the Products (Sejda

receipt.</p>\n<p>Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to

variants).\nNo failure or delay by the injured party to this Agreement in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder at law or equity.\nThe parties are independent contractors.\nThis Agreement shall not be construed as constituting either party as a partner of the other or to create any other form of legal association that would give on party the express or implied right, power or authority to create
