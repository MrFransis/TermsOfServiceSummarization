the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\nExcept as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 21 \u201cDispute Resolution,\u201d the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Company are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the United States of America, and you and Company each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>21.\nDispute Resolution<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes.</u> We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding.\nYou and Company agree that the

action.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Exceptions.</u> As limited exceptions to Section 21(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies.\nand (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our

Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nA party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at

arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous.\nIf we prevail in arbitration we\u2019ll pay all of our attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and won\u2019t seek to recover them from you.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief.</u> Except as provided in Section 21(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nTo the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</li>\n<li>\n<u>Class Action Waiver.</u> YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, if the parties\u2019 Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person\u2019s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be

Agreement (\u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement will still apply.</li>\n</ol>22.\nGeneral Terms<ol>\n<li>\n<u>Reservation of Rights.</u> Company and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services, including all
