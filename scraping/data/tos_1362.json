<strong>\u201cus\u201d</strong>).\nThese terms of service (which includes our Code of Conduct and our Privacy Policy) (<strong>\u201cTerms of Service\u201d</strong>) are a contract between you and Wattpad.\nBy using wattpad.com (the <strong>\u201cSite\u201d</strong>), creating your Wattpad account and using the Site or our mobile applications to post various content to the Wattpad community, including stories you create, comments and messages, or to access and view Wattpad content or other user content (together with the Site, the <strong>\u201cServices\u201d</strong>), you\u2019re

able to take control of the account, and we may not be able to determine who is the proper account holder.\nWe will not have any liability to you (or anyone you share your account information with) as a result of your or their actions under those circumstances.\nIf you find out that someone\u2019s used your account without your permission, you should report it at support.wattpad.com.</p>Back to topBack to topYour Content is Yours<p>Before posting any content to Wattpad, it is important that you read our Content Guidelines.\nIf your content does not comply with these guidelines it may be removed at any time.</p>\n<p>You own all the rights to the content you create and post on the Wattpad Services.\nOf course, if the content wasn\u2019t yours to begin with, putting it on Wattpad doesn\u2019t make it yours.\nDon\u2019t submit content you don\u2019t hold the copyright for (unless you have permission, including to grant Wattpad all the rights outlined in these terms).</p>\n<p>When you post content to Wattpad, we need the legal permission under applicable copyright laws to display that content to users of the Wattpad Services.\nLegally this means you give us a nonexclusive license to publish your content on the Wattpad Services, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it).\nYou\u2019ll need to decide how you want to license your story content to the Wattpad community.\nPlease read our guide on Copyrights for assistance in making this decision</p>\n<p>You\u2019re responsible for the content you post.\nThis means you assume all risks related to its publication and display, including someone else\u2019s reliance on its accuracy and any claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights.</p>\n<p>Wattpad is a free service and to continue to make it free you understand that we enable advertising on the Services, including in connection with
