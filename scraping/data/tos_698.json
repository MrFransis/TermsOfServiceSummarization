discloses or processes your personal information when you use our products and services or visit the Sync website www.sync.com (\u201cWebsite\u201d).\nTo that end, we have outlined below our Ten Privacy Principles based on the Privacy Principles established in Canada\u2019s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) followed by information we are required to provide to our users located in the European Union according to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p> Sync\u2019s Ten Privacy Principles\n<p>Personal information is information that can be used to identify or contact you individually, and other information that Sync needs to provide you with the products and services you have requested.\nPersonal information we collect typically includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number and credit card or payment information.\nUnder certain circumstances, an IP address may be considered personal information.</p>\n<p>Sync has 10 Privacy Principles, based on those established in the PIPEDA.\nSync has implemented policies and practices to give effect to these principles.\nSync has implemented procedures to protect personal information, has established procedures to receive and respond to complaints and inquiries, has trained its staff and communicated to them information about Sync's

Principles.</p> Principle 1 \u2013 Accountability <p>Sync is responsible for personal information under its control.\nSync has designated a Privacy Officer who is accountable for its compliance with our Privacy Policy and PIPEDA.\nSync's Privacy Officer is accountable for our compliance with PIPEDA, but other individuals at Sync may be responsible for day-to-day collection and processing of personal information and may also be delegated to act on behalf of the Privacy Officer.</p>\n<p>Sync may on occasion use outside companies, called third parties, to help us provide our products or services to you.\nRegardless of where these third parties are located, we require that they also comply with PIPEDA and with Sync's Privacy Principles.\n</p> Principle 2 \u2013 Identifying Purposes

change from the Sync desktop app?</li>\n</ul> How to I enable or disable two-factor authentication (2FA)?<br>\n<p>Two-factor authentication is a recommended security feature that can help protect your Sync account from unauthorized access.\nEnabling two-factor authentication means that the Sync apps and web panel will require an additional security code (along with your password ) when you sign in to your account or add a new computer or device.</p>\n<p>You can enable two-factor authentication using a mobile authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator) or using email delivery.</p>\n<p>\n<b>To enable or disable 2FA using email delivery (easiest):</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the web panel.</li>\n<li>Click your <b>email address</b> (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.</li>\n<li>Select <b>Settings.</b>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <b>Security</b> tab.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Edit</b> beside two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Enable 2-FA via email</b> (or <b>Disable</b> to disable 2FA if you previously enabled it).</li>\n<li>Be sure to download the <b>backup codes</b> and store them in a safe place.\nYou can use each backup code once, in the event that you need to sign in and do not have access to your email.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2FA is now enabled.\nYou will have to check your email address for the additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel or install Sync on a new computer or device.</p>\n<p>\n<b>To enable 2FA using a mobile authenticator app (such as Google Authenticator):</b>\n</p>\n<p>Before you begin you will need to download and install the Google Authenticator app on your phone or tablet.\nGet it on the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the web panel.</li>\n<li>Click your <b>email address</b> (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.</li>\n<li>Select <b>Settings.</b>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <b>Security</b> tab.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Edit</b> beside two-factor authentication.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Enable 2-FA via Google Authenticator</b>.\nNote: if 2FA is currently set to Email, click <b>Disable</b> and then

if you\u2019ve already setup the app with other services.\n</li>\n<li>Scan the QR code displayed on the Sync web panel, into the Google Authenticator app.</li>\n<li>The Google Authenticator app will provide a 6-digit verification code.\n<b>Enter the verification code</b> on the Sync web panel and click <b>Save</b>.</li>\n<li>Be sure to download the <b>backup codes</b> and store them in a safe place.\nYou can use each backup code once, in the event that you do not have access to your mobile device.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>2FA is now enabled.\nYou will have to check the Google Authenticator app for the additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel or install Sync on a new computer or device.</p> How do I enable or disable single sign on (SSO)?<br>\n<p>Sync includes a single sign on feature, allowing you to automatically sign in to the web panel from an authenticated Sync desktop app installed on your computer.\n</p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve installed the Sync desktop app you can click the <b>Sync icon</b> on the Windows system tray or the Mac menu bar and select the <b>Go to Sync.com web panel</b> quick link.\nThis will sign you into the web panel automatically, as the desktop app has already been authenticated.</p>\n<p>\n<b>To enable or disable single sign on:</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the web panel.</li>\n<li>Click your <b>email address</b> (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.</li>\n<li>Select <b>Settings.</b>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <b>Security</b> tab.</li>\n<li>Click <b>Edit</b> beside single sign-on.</li>\n<li>Enable or disable the option as needed and click the <b>Enable</b> or <b>Disable</b> button to confirm.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If SSO is disabled, you will be prompted to enter your username and password each time you access the web panel from the desktop app Go to Sync.com web panel quick link.</p>\n<p>SSO does not override two-factor authentication.\nWith 2FA enabled you will be prompted for an additional security code each time you sign in into the web panel, regardless of your SSO settings.</p> How do I manage web panel session time (auto-logout)?<br>\n<p>You can set the web panel to automatically log you out when there is no activity.\nThis is recommended if you frequently sign in to your Sync account from public computers.</p>\n<p>\n<b>To manage auto-logout:</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the web panel.</li>\n<li>Click your <b>email address</b> (or display name) on the top right corner of the blue menu bar.</li>\n<li>Select <b>Settings.</b>\n</li>\n<li>Click the <b>Security</b>

account settings.</p>\n<p>\n<b>To disable (unlink) a device:</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Sign in to the web panel.</li>\n<li>Click your <b>email address</b> (or display name) on the top right corner of the

feature of the app.\nThis can help you control who can change your Sync account password.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Important:</b> if you disable password change on your computer it is highly recommend that you
