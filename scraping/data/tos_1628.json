range of experiences and ages, and we all have something we can learn from each other.\nTo help us grow technically, personally, and as a community it is important that we treat each other with respect and follow some basic guidelines.\nAs a staff we've put together the list below that we feel describes the core guidelines for participation in the community.\nPlease read through them before commenting or posting.\nThanks!\n<br>&nbsp;- Philip</p>\n<p>\n<b>Treat others with kindness and respect</b>.\nEven when someone is rude or disrespectful it\u2019s not a reason to reply in kind.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Absolutely no personal attacks</b>.\nIt\u2019s totally fine to disagree on technical aspects, aesthetics, etc.\nBut don\u2019t let it cross over into insulting someone or conflating it with someone\u2019s character.\nSimilarly, if someone disagrees with your opinions or doesn\u2019t like your build, don\u2019t assume that is an attack on your character.\nDisagreement is allowed.\nPersonal attacks are not.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Don\u2019t troll</b>.\nFor instance, if someone is looking for a low cost build suggestion, don\u2019t reply with an unrealistic and overly expensive part list.\nDon't purposefully state counterpoints for the sake of stirring up arguments or antagonizing other users.\nDon't deliberately post hot-button topics or comments with the intention of stirring things up.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Respect the privacy of others</b>.\nDon\u2019t post personal information about other users.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Respect the intellectual property of others.</b> Don't post material that infringes on another's copyright.\nDon't post links to infringing material on other sites.\nNote: This includes any avatar that you may choose to use.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Only represent yourself</b>.\nDon\u2019t impersonate other users or falsely represent them.\nDon\u2019t claim to be staff or a site moderator if you aren\u2019t.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Don\u2019t circumvent the profanity filter or use excessive profanity</b>.\nWe get that some people communicate using profanity, and others prefer not to see any at all.\nThat\u2019s why there\u2019s a user-configurable profanity filter.\nRespect it - if you want to use profanity and want to see it, do so by turning off your filter.\nDon\u2019t circumvent the filter on purpose - there may be other people who have their filter on on purpose and don\u2019t care to see it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Don\u2019t spam.</b> No really, don\u2019t spam.\nEven if you think you're being funny, you're not.\nBesides the traditional definition, spam on this site also includes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple threads on the same topic</li>\n<li>Repeated posts on threads or builds</li>\n<li>Asking people to comment on your part lists in unrelated topics, builds, etc.</li>\n<li>Lots of nonsensical, zero-effort, or single word/letter replies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>No link shorteners</b>.\nShorteners hide the final URL destination, making it easier to hide malicious or spammy links.\nPosts, builds, guides, and any other content containing link shorteners will be removed.\n(For example: bit.ly, goo.gl, tinyurl, etc.)</p>\n<p>\n<b>No NSFW or sexually inappropriate content</b>.\nThat means excessive gore, pornography, sexually explicit material and innuendo.\nThis applies to all aspects of the site, including forums, avatars, builds, profile descriptions, messaging, etc.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No racism</b>.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No crowdfunding links without staff approval</b>.\nFor example: gofundme, indiegogo, youcaring, etc.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No vote collusion</b>.\nDo not create multiple accounts to apply multiple votes to yourself or others.</p>\n<p>\n<b>When posting topics, please pick the most appropriate forum</b>.\nOnly choose one and don\u2019t cross post.\nIf it\u2019s the wrong forum, staff will gladly move the topic to the appropriate forum.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Refrain from \u201cclickbait\u201d titles</b> when posting forum topics or completed builds.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Avoid alternate part list suggestions on completed builds</b>.\nWhen commenting on completed builds, keep in mind the parts have already been purchased and the build has already been assembled.\nIf you'd like to provide alternative part suggestions, please do so in the part list opinions wanted forum instead.\n</p>\n<p>Staff reserve the right to block, remove, or rewrite affiliate links.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No advocating piracy</b>.\nBroad discussion of the issue in general is allowed.\nBut links to pirated material or torrenting sites are definitely not.\nRecommending or implying piracy as an option is also not allowed.</p>\n<p>\n<b>No key resellers</b>.\nThere are many key resellers available, some made popular by people on youtube.\nThese are not permitted on the site.\nSimilar to piracy - recommending or implying their use as an option is not allowed.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Do not advocate running windows unlicensed</b>.</p>\n<p>If you are an industry affiliate, you are also bound by our Industry Affiliate Code of Conduct.</p>\n<p>And lastly, <b>respect staff decisions and requests</b>.\nThe only moderators on this site are paid staff.\nWe do not have volunteer moderators.\nWe take no pleasure in blocking or banning people.\nWe'd much prefer that everyone get along.\nWe talk to each other often, even sit next to each other, and we\u2019re in agreement on when to take action.\nWhen someone is banned from the site, it is almost always because that user was being a negative influence on the community.\nIf you have issues or questions about moderation decisions we make, please reach out via private message or our contact page.</p>\n", "created_at": "2019-06-15 15:10:39.920295", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 22:45:48.24632"},
