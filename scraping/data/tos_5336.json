2021</em>\n</p>\n<p>By using Zenkit\u2019s online and offline products and services (collectively, \u201cthe Service\u201d or \u201cServices\u201d), provided by the Zenkit division within Axonic Informationssysteme GmbH (collectively, \u201cZenkit,\u201d \u201cWe\u201d or \u201cUs\u201d), you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service (\u201cTOS\u201d), together with our Privacy Policy.\nThe TOS may be updated by us from time to time without notice.\nYou can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: https://zenkit.com/en/terms.</p>\n<p>This TOS governs your access to and use of any Zenkit website, any order you place through a Zenkit website, by telephone or any other means, and, as applicable, your use or attempted use of Zenkit\u2019s products and services (collectively, \u201cYour Use\u201d), including any extensions, mobile applications, and other downloadable products.</p>\n<p>If you are using Zenkit on behalf of a legal entity (such as your employer), you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that legal entity, and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to agree to these Terms on the legal entity\u2019s behalf.\nPlease note that if you use any email address owned or controlled by the legal entity as the primary or sole email address for your Zenkit account, and choose to purchase any goods or services (e.g.\npaid subscriptions, consulting etc.), or are an administrator of a paid account, then (i) you are considered a representative of the legal entity, (ii) your acceptance of these Terms of Service will be deemed to bind this legal entity to this agreement, and (iii) the word \u201cyou\u201d in these Terms will refer to the legal entity.</p>\n<p>By continuing to use Zenkit after revisions become effective, you are agreeing to the revised Terms.\nIf you do not agree to the revised Terms, please stop using Zenkit.\nBy accessing or using Zenkit, you indicate your assent to be bound by these Terms.</p> 1 Your Zenkit Account\n<p>To use Zenkit, you\u2019ll need to create a Zenkit account (\u201cAccount\u201d), either via Zenkit or through a third-party service such as Google.\nIn the latter case, personal information you provided to that third party, such as your name, email address and other information your privacy settings on that service allow us to access, will be used to create your Account.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for safeguarding your Zenkit login credentials.\nYou are responsible for activity on your Account, whether or not you authorized that activity.\nYou should immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breaches of security.\nZenkit will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.</p>\n<p>By signing up for a Zenkit Account or by using Zenkit, you agree to receive important updates directly from Zenkit.\nThis could be in the form of an email, a push notification, or a message inside Zenkit itself.\nThese messages will only be used to inform you of major updates or other things that Zenkit feels is necessary for our users to know.\nThere is no opt-out of these notifications as they are essential to the functionality of our business.</p> 1.1 Your Content on Zenkit\n<p>By using Zenkit, you provide us with text, images, file attachments, and other information (\u201cyour Content\u201d).\nYou retain full ownership of your Content.\nThese Terms don\u2019t give us any rights to your Content except for the limited rights that enable us to offer the Services.</p>\n<p>We need your permission to, for example, host your content, back it up, and share it when you ask us to.\nOur Services also provide you with features like sorting, editing, sharing, and searching your Content.\nThese and other features may require our systems to access, store, and scan your Content.\nYou give us permission to do those things, and this permission extends to our affiliates and trusted third parties we work with.</p>\n<p>You can remove your Content by deleting it.\nHowever, in certain instances, some of your Content may not be completely removed (when your data is shared with someone else, for example).\nWe are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of any of your Content, or the failure to remove or delete such Content.</p>\n<p>If you process personal data (German: \u201cpersonenbezogenen Daten\u201d) or allow personal data to be processed on systems for which Zenkit is technically responsible, and because of this, require for legal reasons a contract following \u00a711 BDSG to be signed, you have the possibility to sign an order data processing agreement with Zenkit which will meet the minimum legal requirements.</p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for your Content and indicate that you own or have the necessary rights to all of your Content, and that use of your Content does not infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>\n<p>You must not add Content in a misleading or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others.\nYou, the customer, are responsible for all personal data stored with Zenkit and also any legal responsibilities that come with the storage and processing of such data.\nYou, therefore, must also know whether the processing of such data, through the use of the Service, adheres to all laws and that you have all of the associated authorizations.</p>\n<p>\u201cPrimary content\u201d includes all data a user creates directly on Zenkit (e.g.\nitems, comments, etc).\n\u201cIndirect Content\u201d may be produced by Zenkit to support functions related to the primary (e.g.\nactivities, permission records, member accesses, etc.).</p> 1.2 Definition of Resources\n<p>All Content will be stored on Zenkit\u2019s services and the underlying technical infrastructure.\nZenkit uses several structures (\u201cResources\u201d) for storing, organizing, sharing, and accessing Content.\nThe names of Resources might differ for different Zenkit products (e.g.\n\u201cworkspaces, collections, items, lists, teams, folders, members\u201d).\nResources can be organized hierarchically and Resources that contain other Resources (e.g.\nfolders contain lists) are called \u201cContainers\u201d for the contained Resources.</p>\n<p>Every Resource has one \u201cOwner\u201d who is responsible for that Resource.\nThe ownership can be transferred.\nIf you are the owner of a Resource, we refer to it as \u201cYour resource\u201d.\nBy default, the owner of a Containing Resource is the owner of all contained Resources.</p>\n<p>Zenkit offers the ability to share resources between Users.\nUsers/Accounts can be granted access to certain Resources.\nUsers/Accounts with access to a Resource are called \u201cMembers\u201d of the Resource.</p> 1.3 Publishing Resources\n<p>You acknowledge that if you choose to publish a Resource, all user names and avatars, any Content included in the Resource, and any activities within the Resource, will be publicly available and viewable to anyone with a link to that Resource.\nPublishing a Resource will make the Resource available to be indexed by web search engines like Google, and thus searchable by anyone with access to the internet and to those indexing sites.\nZenkit has no liability for how any other Party uses or accesses your data as a result of the privacy settings you choose to use on your Resources, or for you or your users\u2019 decision to post your Content on publicly available Resources.</p>\n<p>Zenkit may un-publish (i.e.\nmake private) any Resource for which we believe that the Content contained in that Resource violates the acceptable Use of Zenkit as outlined by the following paragraph, in addition to the subsequently mentioned right to remove access to the Resource or terminate or deny access to the Service.</p>\n<p>Zenkit may change or remove any Content that it considers inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause Zenkit liability.\nZenkit reserves the right, at our sole discretion and at any time, to create or update limits to use and storage.</p>\n<p>Zenkit adheres to all statutory data protection regulations.</p> 1.4 Termination, Breach, Inactivity, and Suspension\n<p>Zenkit may terminate your access to all or any part of the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.\nIf we suspend or terminate your use of Zenkit, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be cases (for example, flagrantly violating these Terms) where we may suspend immediately.\nIf you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Zenkit account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using the Service.\nAll provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>\n<p>If your Account is terminated via means provided for deletion in your Zenkit profile, or by Zenkit, your Account will be disabled and you may not be granted access to your Account or any files or other Content contained in your Account.\nYour user Content and any files contained in your Account will be permanently deleted after some time and be unrecoverable by Zenkit.\nResidual copies of information may remain in our system for some time for back-up purposes.</p>\n<p>You may additionally request via email to Zenkit that communications or other content containing your personal data also be removed.\nZenkit will make all reasonable efforts to do so and will only retain data required by law.</p>\n<p>You must use your Zenkit account to keep it \u201cactive.\u201d Zenkit reserves the right to close all \u201cinactive\u201d Zenkit accounts, with or without notice.\nInactivity is determined by the last login date.\nYou must sign in to your Zenkit account at least once per year to keep your account active.\nIf you don\u2019t sign in during this time, Zenkit will consider your account to be inactive.\nWe will try to notify you of your inactive account status by email, and offer a 30 day period within which you can re-activate the account.\nInactive accounts may be archived or permanently deleted.</p>

access our Service via compatible mobile devices (\u201cMobile Applications\u201d).\nThis software remains subject to these Terms.\nYou agree that you are solely responsible for any data charges you incur in connection with your use of these Mobile Applications from your wireless or data provider.\nYou acknowledge that we occasionally release upgraded versions of the Mobile Applications, and may automatically upgrade the version of the Mobile Applications that you are using on your device.\nYou consent to these automatic upgrades, and agree that these Terms will apply to all such upgrades.\nAny third-party code used in the Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code.</p>\n3.2 App Store Terms\n<p>If you download or purchase any Zenkit Mobile Applications from any third-party app store: (i) you acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Zenkit only, and not with the third

then-current app store terms and conditions.\n(iv) we, and not the third party, are solely responsible for our Mobile Applications.\nand (v) you acknowledge and agree that such third-party is a third-party beneficiary to these Terms as it relates to such Mobile Applications.</p> 4 Subscriptions and Plans\n4.1 Definition and Scope\n<p>Zenkit offers different standalone Products (e.g.\n\u201cBase\u201d, \u201cTo Do\u201d, \u201cZenchat\u201d, \u201cProjects\u201d, \u201cCRM\u201d, \u201cWiki\u201d etc.).\nEach product can be used with differing levels of features and quotas (\u201cPlans\u201d).\nWe offer several Plans for each Product with distinct names (e.g.\nFree, Plus, Business, Enterprise).</p>\n<p>Some products offer a free Plan, all non-free plans are called \u201cPaid Plans\u201d.\nAll details of a Plan are defined in the \u201cPlan Terms\u201d.\nThe Plan Terms include: features, functions, quotas, limits, free quotas of resources, free quotas of member-accesses,&nbsp.\netc.\nThe relevant Plan Terms are defined on the pricing page of each Product.</p>\n<p>A Plan can be made available to your Account via a Subscription.\nIn case a Product offers a free Plan, you will automatically have a Subscription with a free plan (\u201cfree Subscription\u201d).\nIf you choose to create another (non-free) Subscription, you shall pay fees to Zenkit.</p>\n<p>The process of purchasing a (non-free) Subscription is called an \u201cUpgrade\u201d.\nMoving from a Subscription to a less valuable or free Subscription is called \u201cDowngrade\u201d.\nThe process of canceling a Subscription is called \u201cCancellation\u201d.</p>\n<p>A Subscription is a set of information, valid for one Account and one Product.\nIt contains, the account-Identifier, the product-Identifier, the plan, the quota of members/users (\u201cSeats\u201d) who can access the associated Resources, additional volume packages and quotas, the period of time in which the subscription is valid (\u201cService Period\u201d), the time of its creation (\u201cPurchase Time\u201d), the pricing based on the Plan Terms, and the billing and payment information (see below), the renewal details.\nThis set of information forms the \u201cSubscription Quotas\u201d.</p>\n<p>This means that you purchase a Subscription at a certain purchase time for your Account, with a certain contingent of member-accesses (\u201cseats\u201d), for a specific Product, for a specific Plan, for a certain service period at a certain price.\nThis information (including the plan terms) is fixed at the purchase time.\nThat also means you need to purchase/create a separate Subscription for each Product you use.</p>\n<p>It is possible to use multiple Zenkit Products simultaneously.\nIf you choose to purchase a Paid Plan for more than one Product, it is possible to receive a small discount in the form of bundle pricing.\nTo inquire about bundle pricing, please contact sales @ zenkit .\ncom.</p> 4.2 Usage and exceeding limits\n<p>Within a Product, you can access certain Resources (your own and owned by others).\nThe \u201cusage\u201d of a Product for your Account is calculated and measured based on your Subscription.\nIt may include e.g.\nthe number of members who have access to the Resources, the number of owned and external Resources, and volume of Resources.</p>\n<p>If your usage is more than your Subscription quotas for the Product, your Subscription is \u201cexceeded\u201d.\nExceeded subscriptions go though several \u201cescalation levels\u201d, e.g.\nmaking the Account and the owned Resources read-only.</p> 5 Payment Terms and Conditions\n<p>Subscriptions can be ordered via online order (\u201cOnline Subscription\u201d) or any ordering document (\u201cOrder Form Subscription\u201d) including requests via email.\nUpon selection of a Subscription, you must provide Zenkit with the necessary billing information (\u201cBilling Data\u201d).</p>\n<p>Zenkit may occasionally revise fee rates and/or the billable subscription fee (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d) structure and will provide you with email notice of any changes in fees at least thirty (30) days prior.</p>\n<p>If you purchase a Subscription and provide Billing Data, you agree to these payment terms and conditions.</p> 5.1 Renewals\n<p>By default, Subscriptions will automatically renew for an additional period of time until cancelation.\nBy default this period is based on your initial service time (e.g.\none month or one year).\nIt requires recurring payments.\nThis is true for both Online Subscriptions and Order Form Subscriptions.\nFees will be charged in advance on an annual or monthly basis based on your subscription.\nZenkit may automatically charge you for this renewal on or after the renewal date associated with your account unless you have terminated the Subscription or Zenkit terminates the Subscription prior to the renewal date.</p> 5.2 Billing and Payment Methods\n<p>Zenkit accepts payment via Credit Card and PayPal for Online Subscriptions, and additionally payment via bank transfer for Order Form Subscriptions.\nSubscriptions can be paid as either a monthly or yearly Subscription Fee.</p>\n<p>If you purchase a Subscription, you must provide current, complete and accurate Billing Data.\nIt is your duty to ensure that your Billing Data is kept up-to-date in case of a change, such as a new Credit Card number or change of billing address.</p>\n<p>Zenkit will charge tax when required to do so by law.\nYou are responsible for all sales, use, value added or other taxes of any kind related to your purchase of a Subscription (excluding Zenkit\u2019s net income).\nYou are also responsible for any payment-related fees such as wire transfer, PayPal, or Credit Card processing fees.</p>\n<p>Payment is expected within 2 weeks of receipt of the invoice.\nIf you cannot make this payment date, please contact billing @ zenkit .\ncom in advance.</p> 5.3 Cancellation\n<p>You must cancel the Subscription prior to its renewal date in order to avoid billing of the next Subscription Term\u2019s fee.\nFees are non-refundable based on the Subscription Term purchased and not actual usage.\nPayment obligations for the Subscription Term to which you subscribe are non-cancelable.</p>\n<p>You may cancel or manage your Online Subscription at any time prior to the renewal date from the \u201cPlans/Subscription/Payments\u201d section of your Zenkit Profile.\nReducing the number of users in your account is not sufficient to modify or cancel your Subscription, you must make these changes within your Zenkit profile.\nFor Order Form Subscriptions, cancellation must be requested in writing, including by email to billing @ zenkit .\ncom, at least one week (7 days) prior to the expiration of the then-current Subscription Term.</p>\n<p>If you choose to cancel your Subscription, you may continue to use the Subscription until the end of the current Subscription Term, but you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged fees.</p> 5.4 Late Payments\n<p>If the payment of your Subscription Fee is overdue by more than 2 weeks (14 days), or if you are over the quota allowed by your Subscription for more than 2 weeks, Zenkit will suspend your account.\nYour Content will remain accessible to you, but you may not add any new Content or make changes to your existing Content until payment of your Subscription Fee is received in full.</p> 5.5 Subscriptions purchased through an app store or other distribution platform\n<p>If you purchase your subscription via a Zenkit mobile app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (App Store), these purchases are subject to the terms and conditions of the App Store.\nAll billing and refund enquiries must be directed to the App Store providers, and not Zenkit.\nZenkit does not have access to Apple or Google accounts or transactions.</p>\n<p>If you wish to confirm the type of subscription that you have purchased from the App Store, please consult your App Store account or receipt.</p>\n<p>As outlined in paragraph 5.1, your Plan will be renewed by the App Store on a yearly or monthly basis, depending on your chosen billing period, until you cancel it.\nApp Store subscriptions can be managed from a mobile device or computer that uses the same Apple ID or Google login as the initial purchase.\nZenkit cannot manage subscriptions purchased through an App Store.</p> 5.6 Email Domains\n<p>Please note the domain of the email address that you use to register with is significant, as Zenkit Users with the same non-public domain are classed together as one group, regardless of their connection to one another.\nThis will mean that if there are 3 Users already registered using the same email domain, the original three Users and any additional Users are required to purchase an upgrade.</p> 6 Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy\n<p>As Zenkit asks others to respect its intellectual property (IP) rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others.\nIf you believe that material located on or linked to by Zenkit violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify Zenkit at copyright @ zenkit .\ncom and include the following information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Your full legal name and electronic or physical signature</li>\n<li>A description of the copyrighted work or other items that you believe has been infringed</li>\n<li>Enough information to properly identify and locate that content (including the relevant URL)</li>\n<li>Contact information, including telephone number, and email address</li>\n<li>The following statements in the body of notice:\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cI hereby state that I have not authorized the challenged use, and I have a good-faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cI hereby state under penalty of perjury that all of the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the owner of the IP, or authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the IP.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Zenkit will respond to such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material.\nZenkit will terminate a visitor\u2019s access to and use of the Website, Products and/or Services if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Zenkit or others.\nIn the case of such termination, Zenkit will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to Zenkit.</p> 7 Intellectual Property\n<p>This agreement does not transfer from Zenkit to you any Zenkit or third party intellectual property, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Zenkit.\nZenkit and the Zenkit logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with Zenkit, or the Website, Products, or Services, are trademarks or registered trademarks of Zenkit or
