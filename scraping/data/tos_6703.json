whether the payment made by the User using the given email address was successful or not, as well as information about the country from which the payment was made.\nPimEyes processes this data to register payment for the service and, as a result, to perform the service,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The payment servicing entity also provides PimEyes with User identification data, i.e., name and

rights is possible only by providing by the User respectively a photo of the User, an anonymized scan of identification document, an email address, and a telephone number.\nThe aforementioned data are

cases, PimEyes can obtain personal data not directly from the data subject but from another entity, which would be a controller of such data.\nIt may happen in the cases described above, i.e., when

from the payment servicing entity.</p>\n<p>In the case of data of unidentified entities, processed in the PimEyes\u2019s index referred to in point 4 above, the data comes from publicly available sources.\nWhen collecting such data, PimEyes respects the special rules of each website visited by PimEyesBot web robots and downloads data only from the sites whose robots.txt allows

information not linked to any personal identification information regarding visitors and users with PimEyes\u2019 business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.</p> HOW LONG USERS PERSONAL DATA WILL BE STORED? <p>As a rule, personal data will be stored for the duration of the service and after its completion - for the period necessary to establish, exercise or defend of legal claims and for compliance with a legal obligation to which PimEyes is subject (e.g., invoice issue and storage).\nHowever, in some cases, PimEyes may store data for a

withdrawn.</p>\n<p>Removing data from the User\u2019s account shall mean that the User withdraws their consent to the processing of the data collected there for each purpose for which the consent was given.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Face images along with the \"fingerprint\" of face of unregistered Users are stored for 48 hours from the moment the User sends the photo in order to process the search
