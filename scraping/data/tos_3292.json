hosted or sponsored webinar or in our Serious Privacy Podcast, your business contact information will be processed as part of the production.\nThis includes your name, email address, phone number, company name and job title.\nThese programs are recorded and broadcast publicly, as is the nature of such programs, which includes your voice and the information you share during such programs.</p>\n<p>If you visit the websites and online properties we provide:</p>\n<p>Our website: We process personal information about you that we collect either directly, through forms or data entry fields on our website, or through passive collection by cookies and other data collection technologies.\nThe types of personal data we process in each of these contexts is further explained in the following four categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact us and registration forms: we process your name, email address, company where you work, phone number, job function, job title, country, and any comments you provide.</li>\n<li>Consumer opinion surveys: we process your survey responses</li>\n<li>Cookies and other data collection technologies: we use browser session cookies, which are temporary cookies that are erased from your device\u2019s memory when you close your Internet browser or turn your computer off, and persistent cookies, which are stored on your device until they expire, unless you delete them before that time.\nWe group browser cookies on our site into three categories, which you can manage through our \u201cCookie Preferences\u201d manager:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Required cookies</i>: These cookies are necessary to enable the basic features of this site to function, such as allowing images to load or allowing you to select your cookie preferences.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Functional cookies</i>: These cookies allow us to analyze your use of the site to evaluate and improve our performance.\nThey may also be used to provide a better customer experience on this site.\nFor example, remembering your log-in details or providing us information about how our site is used.</li>\n<li>\n<i>Advertising cookies</i>: These cookies may be used to share data with advertisers so that the ads you see are more relevant to you, allow you to share certain pages with social networks, or allow you to post comments on our site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Videos and other features on our site use Flash cookies to collect and store your preferences, such as volume.\nFlash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and way that data is stored.\nCookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.\nTo learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here.<br>\nSome cookies may be placed by third party service providers who perform some of these functions for us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Server log files: We automatically gather server log file information when you visit our websites.\nThis includes IP address, browser type, referring and exit web pages, and your operating system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cookie Preference Manager: If you use our preference manager on a mobile device, we process your device\u2019s Advertising Identifier.\nWhen you access our preference manager, session cookies will be set by the ad networks listed in our preference manager to honor your preferences if you choose not to receive interest-based advertising.\nIf you clear your browser cookies, this will remove all cookies including the opt-out cookies set by the companies.\nYou will need to re-access the opt-out tool to reset your preferences.\nOur cookie only knows your last set of preferences and does not reflect the current state of cookies on your browser.</p>\n<p>Individual Rights Manager: When you submit a request related to our processing of personal information about you, we process your name, email address, residence, type of request, the individual type you select on the form, any comments you provide, and any additional information needed to verify your identity.\nWhen you submit a request to another company that has implemented our Individual Rights Manager, we process the information you provide in the form implemented by that company, and we support the management of your request by the company as well as retrieval of information responsive to your request.</p>\n<p>Direct Marketing Consent Manager: If a company has implemented our Direct Marketing Consent Manager, we process a pseudonymous identifier related to you to help that company manage your consent preferences.\nTrustArc uses this approach to allow the company to manage your personal information rather than TrustArc.</p>\n<p>Ads Interests Manager: If you click through an icon associated with our Ads Interests Manager in an online advertisement, we process information about your interests.</p>\n<p>TrustArc Ads Compliance Manager: We process cookies to deliver our interest-based advertising notice and choice program\u2019s opt-out tools to assist with your opt-out choices and to help us measure usage.\nOur opt-out tool signals companies to not use your browsing behavior to provide interest-based advertising by setting their opt-out cookie in your browser.\nWhen you access our preference manager, session cookies will be set by the ad networks listed in our preference manager to honor your preferences if you choose not to receive interest-based advertising.\nIf you clear your browser cookies, this will remove all cookies including the opt-out cookies set by the companies.\nYou will need to re-access the opt-out tool to reset your preferences.\nOur cookie only knows your last set of preferences and does not reflect the current state of cookies on your browser.</p>\n<p>TRUSTe Dispute Resolution Program: We encourage you to use TRUSTe\u2019s Dispute Resolution Program to report and resolve privacy complaints you may have concerning TRUSTe Certification or Dispute Resolution Program Participants, or to report misuse of TRUSTe trademarks.\nIf you file a privacy-related complaint, we process your name, email, and country location.\nWe will also request that you provide the details that gave rise to your complaint.\nAny additional personal information you choose to provide in the complaint form is optional.</p>\n<p>Serious Privacy
