Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p>\nNotice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution\n<p>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.\nA Notice to the Company should be sent to: United States.\nAfter the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.\nIf you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.</p>\nArbitration Rules\n<p>Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.\nIf you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.\nEach party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p>\nAdditional Rules for

the pertinent claim.</p>\nAuthority of Arbitrator\n<p>If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be

have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator shall issue

that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p>\nWaiver of Jury Trial\n<p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions\n<p>All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p>\nConfidentiality\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential.\nThe parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\nThis paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p>\nSeverability\n<p>If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>\nRight to Waive\n<p>Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\nSurvival of Agreement\n<p>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p>\nSmall Claims Court\n<p>Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>\nEmergency Equitable Relief\n<p>Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\nClaims Not Subject to Arbitration\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>\n<p>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the
