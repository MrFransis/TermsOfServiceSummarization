Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below.\nThis license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of MetaMask and its users.\nit does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.&nbsp;<strong>\n<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to MetaMask.\nExcept for the license granted herein to MetaMask and recipients of software distributed by MetaMask, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your
