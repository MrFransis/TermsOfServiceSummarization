2020</p>\nA.\nDefinitions\n<p>\n<strong>Short version:</strong>\n<em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings.\nYou should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.\nThere's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.</em>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An \"Account\" represents your legal relationship with GitHub.\nA \u201cUser Account\u201d represents an individual User\u2019s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User\u2019s identity on GitHub.\n\u201cOrganizations\u201d are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once.\nA User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.</li>\n<li>The \u201cAgreement\u201d refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.\nMost of our site policies are available at docs.github.com/categories/site-policy.</li>\n<li>\"Beta Previews\" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.</li>\n<li>\u201cContent\u201d refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text,

controls.\na human must create your Account.\nyou must be 13 or over.\nyou must provide a valid email address.\nand you may not have more than one free Account.\nYou alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account.\nYou are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</em>\n</p>\n1.\nAccount Controls\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Users.\nSubject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Organizations.\nThe \"owner\" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it.\nWithin the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization\u2019s data and projects.\nAn Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization.\nIf you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n2.\nRequired Information\n<p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process.\nAny other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>\n3.\nAccount Requirements\n<p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on GitHub's Service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must be a human to create an Account.\nAccounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted.\nWe do permit machine accounts:</li>\n<li>A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions.\nA machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks.\nMultiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions.\nYou may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.</li>\n<li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>\n<li>You must be age 13 or older.\nWhile we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law.\nGitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.\nIf we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User\u2019s Account immediately.\nIf you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country\u2019s minimum age may be older.\nin such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country\u2019s laws.</li>\n<li>Your login may only be used by one person \u2014 i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.\nA paid Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.</li>\n<li>You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.\nYou may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S.\ngovernment agency.\nGitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S.\ngovernment authorizations.\nFor more information, please see our Export Controls policy.\n</li>\n</ul>\n4.\nUser Account Security\n<p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service.\nWe offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).</li>\n<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password.\nGitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>\n<li>You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</li>\n</ul>\n5.\nAdditional Terms\n<p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub.\nFor example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements.\nyou may download an application that integrates with GitHub.\nor you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service.\nPlease be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>\n<p>If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>\n<p>If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the Enterprise Cloud Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.</p>\nC.\nAcceptable Use\n<p>\n<strong>Short version:</strong>\n<em>GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith.\nWhile using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations.\nIn short, be excellent to each other.</em>\n</p>\n<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction.\nYou are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>\n<p>You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our Acceptable Use Policies or Community Guidelines.</p>\nD.\nUser-Generated Content\n<p>\n<strong>Short version:</strong>\n<em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post.\nYou still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service.\nWe have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.</em>\n</p>\n1.\nResponsibility for User-Generated Content\n<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.\nYou are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content.\nWe are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>\n2.\nGitHub May Remove Content\n<p>We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or GitHub terms or policies.\nUser-Generated Content displayed on GitHub for mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.</p>\n3.\nOwnership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants\n<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content.\nIf you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post.\nthat you will only submit Content that you have the right to post.\nand that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>\n<p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us \u2014 and other GitHub Users \u2014 certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7.\nThese license grants apply to Your Content.\nIf you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required.\nYou understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 \u2014 D.7.\nThe licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>\n4.\nLicense Grant to Us\n<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it.\nYou grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time.\nThis license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups.\nshow it to you and other users.\nparse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.\nshare it with other users.\nand perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>\n<p>This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content.\nIt also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program.</p>\n5.\nLicense Grant to Other Users\n<p>Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others.\nBy setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).</p>\n<p>If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking).\nYou may grant further rights if you adopt a license.\nIf you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.</p>\n6.\nContributions Under Repository License\n<p>Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms.\nIf you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.</p>\n<p>Isn't this just how it works already? Yep.\nThis is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community.\nit's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\".\nWe're just making it explicit.</p>\n7.\nMoral Rights\n<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution.\nHowever, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>\n<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>\nE.\nPrivate Repositories\n<p>\n<strong>Short version:</strong>\n<em>We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement\u2014for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.</em>\n</p>\n1.\nControl of Private Repositories\n<p>Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.</p>\n2.\nConfidentiality of Private Repositories\n<p>GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you.\nGitHub will protect the contents of private repositories

care.</p>\n3.\nAccess\n<p>GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our Privacy Statement.</p>\n<p>You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories.\nThese rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential.\nIf those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private repositories.\n</p>\n<p>GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by

Preview, will be considered GitHub\u2019s confidential information (collectively, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such.\nYou agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the \u201cPurpose\u201d), and not for any other purpose.\nYou should use the same degree of care

information will be shared, with whom, and why.\nFor example, if you purchase an application listed on our Marketplace, we share your username to allow the application Developer to provide you with

the owner of the Organization with the ability to view your activity in the Organization\u2019s access log.</p>\nWith service providers\n<p>We share User Personal Information with a limited number of service providers who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our Service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to the ones in our Privacy Statement by signing data protection

processes all User Personal Information in the United States, our service providers may process data outside of the United States or the European Union.\nIf you would like to know who our service providers are, please see our page on Subprocessors.</p>\nFor security purposes\n<p>If you are a member of an Organization, GitHub may share your username, Usage Information, and Device Information

<strong>do not</strong> sell your User Personal Information for monetary or other consideration.</p>\n<p>Please note: The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) requires businesses to state in their privacy policy whether or not they disclose personal information in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration.\nWhile CCPA only covers California residents, we voluntarily extend its core rights for people to control their data to <em>all</em> of our users, not just those who live in California.\nYou can learn more about the CCPA and how we comply with it here.</p>\nRepository contents\nAccess to private repositories\n<p>If your repository is private, you control the access to your Content.\nIf you include User Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, that information may only be accessible to GitHub in accordance with this Privacy Statement.\nGitHub personnel do not access private repository content except for </p>\n<ul>\n<li>security purposes</li>\n<li>to assist the repository owner with a support matter</li>\n<li>to maintain the integrity of the Service</li>\n<li>to comply with our legal obligations</li>\n<li>if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or </li>\n<li>with your consent.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers and content to detect certain tokens or security signatures, known active malware, known vulnerabilities in dependencies, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service, such as violent extremist or terrorist content or child exploitation imagery, based on algorithmic fingerprinting techniques (collectively, \"automated scanning\").\nOur Terms of Service provides more details on private repositories.</p>\n<p>Please note, you may choose to disable certain access to your private repositories that is enabled by default as part of providing you with the Service (for example, automated scanning needed to enable Dependency Graph and Dependabot alerts).</p>\n<p>GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless for legal disclosure, to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.</p>\nPublic repositories\n<p>If your repository is public, anyone may view its contents.\nIf you include User Personal Information, Sensitive Personal Information, or confidential information, such as email addresses or passwords, in your public repository, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties.</p>\n<p>Please see more about User Personal Information in public repositories.</p>\nOther important information\nPublic information on GitHub\n<p>Many of GitHub services and features are public-facing.\nIf your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service, such as by viewing your profile or repositories or pulling data via our API.\nWe do not sell that content.\nit is yours.\nHowever, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information.\nOther third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape GitHub and compile data as well.</p>\n<p>Your User Personal Information associated with your content could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data.\nIf you do not want your User Personal Information to appear in third parties\u2019 compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your User Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile and in your git commit settings.\nWe currently set Users' email address to private by default, but legacy GitHub Users may need to update their settings.</p>\n<p>If you would like to compile GitHub data, you must comply with our Terms of Service regarding information usage and privacy, and you may only use any public-facing User Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user authorized it.\nFor example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails to users or selling User Personal Information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards, or for commercial advertising.\nWe expect you to reasonably secure any User Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub users.</p>\n<p>Similarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available User Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process.\nIf you have a complaint about any User Personal Information on GitHub, please see our section on resolving complaints.</p>\nOrganizations\n<p>You may indicate, through your actions on GitHub, that you are willing to share your User Personal Information.\nIf you collaborate on or become a member of an Organization, then its Account owners may receive your User Personal Information.\nWhen you accept an invitation to an Organization, you will be notified of the types of information owners may be able to see (for more information, see About Organization Membership).\nIf you accept an invitation to an Organization with a verified domain, then the owners of that Organization will be able to see your full email address(es) within that Organization's verified domain(s).</p>\n<p>Please note, GitHub may share your username, Usage Information, and Device Information with the owner(s) of the Organization you are a member of, to the extent that your User Personal Information is provided only to investigate or respond to a security incident that affects or compromises the security of that particular Organization.</p>\n<p>If you collaborate on or become a member of an Account that has agreed to the Corporate Terms of Service and a Data Protection Addendum (DPA) to this Privacy Statement, then that DPA governs in the event of any conflicts between this Privacy Statement and the DPA with respect to your activity in the Account.</p>\n<p>Please contact the Account owners for more information about how they might process your User Personal Information in their Organization and the ways for you to access, update, alter, or delete the User Personal Information stored in the Account.</p>\nAdditional services\nThird party applications\n<p>You have the option of enabling or adding third-party applications, known as \"Developer Products,\" to your Account.\nThese Developer Products are not necessary for your use of GitHub.\nWe will share your User Personal Information with third parties when you ask us to, such as by purchasing a Developer Product from the Marketplace.\nhowever, you are responsible for your use of the third-party Developer Product and for the amount of User Personal Information you choose to share with it.\nYou can check our API documentation to see what information is provided when you authenticate into a Developer Product using your GitHub profile.</p>\nGitHub Pages\n<p>If you create a GitHub Pages website, it is your responsibility to post a privacy statement that accurately describes how you collect, use, and share personal information and other visitor information, and how you comply with applicable data privacy laws, rules, and regulations.\nPlease note that GitHub may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service.</p>\nGitHub applications\n<p>You can also add applications from GitHub, such as our Desktop app, our Atom application, or other application and account features, to your Account.\nThese applications each have their own terms and may collect different kinds of User Personal Information.\nhowever, all GitHub applications are subject to this Privacy Statement, and we collect the amount of User Personal Information necessary, and use it only for the purpose for which you have given it to us.</p>\nHow you can access and control the information we collect\n<p>If you're already a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.\nYou can control the information we collect about you by limiting what information is in your profile, by keeping your information current, or by contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.</p>\n<p>If GitHub processes information about you, such as information GitHub

contacting GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support.</p>\nData portability\n<p>As a GitHub User, you can always take your data with you.\nYou can clone your repositories to your desktop, for example, or you can use our Data Portability tools to download information we have about you.</p>\nData retention and deletion of data\n<p>Generally, GitHub retains User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.</p>\n<p>If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile.\nWe retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 90 days of your request.\nYou may contact GitHub Support or GitHub Premium Support to request the erasure of the data we process on the basis of consent within 30 days.</p>\n<p>After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to other Users' repositories and comments in others' issues, will remain.\nHowever, we will delete or de-identify your User Personal Information, including your username and email address, from the author field of issues, pull requests, and comments by associating them with a ghost user.</p>\n<p>That said, the email address you have supplied via your Git commit settings will always be associated with your commits in the Git system.\nIf you choose to make your email address private, you should also update your Git commit settings.\nWe are unable to change or delete data in the Git commit history \u2014 the Git software is designed to maintain a record \u2014 but we do enable you to control what information you put in that record.</p>\nOur use of cookies and tracking\nCookies\n<p>GitHub uses cookies and similar technologies (e.g., HTML5 localStorage) to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful.\nCookies are small text files that websites often store on computer hard drives or mobile devices of visitors.\nWe use cookies and similar technologies (hereafter collectively \"cookies\") to provide you our services, for example, to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, identify your device for security purposes, and provide information for future development of GitHub.\nBy using our Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device.\nIf you disable your browser or device\u2019s ability to accept these cookies, you will not be able to

those cookies, and the expiration of such cookies.\nIt also lists our third-party analytics providers and how you can control your cookie preference settings for such cookies.</p>\nTracking and analytics\n<p>We use a number of third-party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our Users' use of GitHub, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and Website performance.\nWe only use these third-party analytics providers on certain areas of our Website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of User Personal Information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information.\nIn addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.</p>\n<p>Some browsers have incorporated \"Do Not Track\" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked.\nGitHub responds to browser DNT signals and follows the W3C standard for responding to DNT signals.\nIf you have not enabled DNT on a browser that supports it, cookies on some parts of our Website will track your online browsing activity on other online services over time, though we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track GitHub Users' activity over time on GitHub.\nYou can read more about DNT in our Tracking on GitHub section of our GitHub Subprocessors and Cookies page.</p>\nHow GitHub secures your information\n<p>GitHub takes all measures reasonably necessary to

as a processor, GitHub will be the subprocessor).\nor (b) when you and GitHub have entered into a separate agreement that covers data privacy (such as a Data Processing Agreement).</p>\n<p>Our addresses are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub, Inc., 88 Colin P.\nKelly Jr.\nStreet, San Francisco, CA 94107.</li>\n<li>GitHub B.V., Vijzelstraat 68-72, 1017 HL Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We store and process the information that we collect in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement, though our service providers may store and process data outside the United States.\nHowever, we understand that we have Users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs even when the United States does not have the same privacy framework as other countries.</p>\n<p>We provide the same high standard of privacy protection\u2014as described in this Privacy Statement\u2014to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide.\nWe work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business, working with our Data Protection Officer as part of a cross-functional team that oversees our privacy compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must sign agreements that require them to comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws.</p>\n<p>In

amount of data you are comfortable sharing.</li>\n<li>We offer you simple methods of accessing, altering, or deleting the User Personal Information we have collected, where legally permitted.</li>\n<li>We provide our Users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access regarding their User Personal Information, and we limit the purpose for processing it.\nWe also provide our Users a method of recourse and enforcement.</li>\n</ul>\nCross-border data transfers\n<p>GitHub processes personal information both inside and outside of the United States and relies on Standard Contractual Clauses as the legally provided mechanism to lawfully transfer data from the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland to the United States.\nIn addition, GitHub is certified to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.\nTo learn more about our cross-border data transfers, see our Global Privacy Practices.</p>\nHow we communicate with you\n<p>We use your

request, we respond to you via email.\nYou have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through GitHub.\nYou may manage your communication preferences in your user profile.</p>\n<p>By design, the Git version control system associates many actions with a User's email address, such as commit messages.\nWe are not able to change many aspects of the Git system.\nIf you would like your email address to remain private, even when you\u2019re commenting on public repositories, you can create a private email address in your user profile.\nYou should also update your local Git configuration to use your private email address.\nThis will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you.\nWe set current Users' email address private by default, but legacy GitHub Users may need to update their settings.\nPlease see more about email addresses in commit messages here.</p>\n<p>Depending on your email settings, GitHub may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you\u2019re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or to offer customer support.\nWe also send marketing emails, based on your choices and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\nThere's an \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link located at the bottom of each of the marketing emails we send you.\nPlease note that you cannot opt out of receiving important communications from us, such as emails from our Support team or system emails, but you can configure your notifications settings in your profile to opt out of other communications.</p>\n<p>Our emails may contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is.\nWe use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we\u2019re not sending you unwanted email.</p>\nResolving complaints\n<p>If you have concerns about the way GitHub is handling
