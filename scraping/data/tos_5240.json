ways:<ul>\n<li>Conducive Search:<ul>\n<li>Before your search (\"pre-search\"): we show tiles for different trusted brands with which we have commercial relationships (\"Our Brands\") below our search box using data signals to predict those that may be of most interest to you;</li>\n<li>During your search: we show relevant, \"instant search\" links for Our Brands based on what you are typing and these links allow you to directly navigate to the brand site and \"skip\" the search engine results page (the \"SERP\");</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Search Results (\"post-search\"): you\u2019ll see your search results and we add related sponsored links from Our Brands;</li>\n<li>Native Search:<ul>\n<li>Deep-linking: we show embedded keyword links that may be of interest to you for Our Brands featured within relevant, brand-safe editorial or consumer-generated content</li>\n<li>Push Notifications: we show dynamically delivered notification links for Our Brands at a specific time of day on your desktop or mobile device only if you have actively opted-in to receive them</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Omnibox Search: we will auto-complete and/or redirect your mistypes and misspells, by bypassing parked pages, to Our Brands\u2019 domains that you had the intention to type</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<p>We ensure ads comply with applicable regulations and our obligations, to provide our customers with reports to analyze their campaigns (such as which ads were delivered and the number of clicks) and to detect and prevent fraud.<br>\n<br>Using IP addresses helps us ensure ads are running in permitted territories, to better place ads, and flag fraudulent traffic.\nCookies may be used to track how you interact with the advertisement and the publisher\u2019s website (please see section 10 below).</p>\n<br>Our legal basis for this processing is:<ul>\n<li>For display of advertising: your consent (which you give to the Publisher when you visit their site).\nand</li>\n<li>For analytics and

Collect?</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search information<br>\n<br>adMarketplace\u2019s network shows ads to visitors on our publisher\u2019s websites.\nWe receive and analyze the search terms (keywords) entered into the search box on those sites.\nWe may also receive technical information such as your approximate location, browser type, language settings, user agent, timestamp, cookie ID and IP addresses.\nWe also receive information regarding which ads were viewed or clicked on and that you arrived on or made a purchase from one of our advertiser\u2019s websites.<br>\n<br>Our publisher partners might also collect personal data by dropping cookies on your device.\nwe recommend that you refer to their respective privacy policies.<br>\n<br>When a user types a search query, we will match ads between the current user agent and IP address and the search query, and those ads will appear in the scroll down menu below the search box.\nIf the user clicks on the ad, we will collect the click information (along with ad information\u2026), then a cookie will be dropped on the user\u2019s device.\nIf the user proceeds to the site redirected from the ad he clicked on, and if the user then purchases a product or a service or completes an action during that session, then a conversion pixel might be fired from the advertiser site.\nThis helps adMarketplace and the advertiser measure the effectiveness of its advertising.<br>\n<br>When the user uses our products in a mobile environment, we might sometimes collect the device IDs (unique identifiers to the phone the user is using).<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>Website<br>\n<br>On our \"contact us\" pages, fields are provided so that you can input your name and contact details.\nWe collect this information so that we can respond to the comments or questions that you send us via that form.\nIf you do not provide us with this information we may not be able to fully complete your request.\nWe do not merge any such information collected via our contact form with other data collected on our website.<br>\n<br>In order to maintain and manage our website, we record other information such as IP addresses, page views and clicks, and cookies for gathering website statistics.\nWe also store IP addresses on our server in the event that our site becomes corrupted and it becomes necessary to discover the cause</li>\n<br>\n<li>Business Contacts<br>\n<br>We collect billing and contact information in order to administer our customers\u2019 accounts, and fulfil the services they request, and also when we are evaluating or purchasing goods and services from new or existing vendors.<br>\n<br>In order to provide certain services, we may also collect information from you when you attend one of our events, during phone calls with sales representatives, or when you contact an adMarketplace representative.\nWe may on occasion supplement the information you submitted to us with information from third party sources to verify your address as part of our anti-fraud effort.<br>\n<br>We may also obtain information from public sources, such as professional networking platforms, trade shows, or other directories, as part of our business development activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nSecurity</b>\n</p>\n<p>adMarketplace applies reasonable security measures to protect data from unauthorized access, corruption or loss.\nThese include storing information in databases which are protected by security measures such as password protection and encryption at rest using Transport Layer Security technology (TLS), so that even if the data is improperly accessed, it is less likely to be in an intelligible format.\nWhen no longer required, this data is moved to our secure archive server, also encrypted and password protected and only accessed for regulatory, legal or business reasons.</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nThird Parties</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may provide data for specific purposes to data processors

back to you.</p>\n<p>In case of any issue, please contact us using the details in this Notice and we will help as far as we can.\nIf you believe that we have not respected your rights then you also have a right to make a complaint to the Supervisory Authority in your country (e.g.\nin the UK, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office: www.ico.org.uk)</p>\n<p>You may ask to exercise any of your

right to notice, (2) right to access, (3) right to opt-out (or right to opt-in), (4) right to request deletion, and (5) right to equal services and prices.</p>\n<p>Right to notice: Under the CCPA, businesses must inform consumers at or before the point of collection what categories of personal information will be collected and the purposes for which these categories will be used.</p>\n<p>Right to access: Consumers have the right to request that a business disclose the categories of personal information collected.\nthe categories of sources from which personal information is collected.\nthe business or commercial purpose.\nthe categories of third parties with which the business shares personal information.\nand the specific pieces of personal information the business holds about a consumer.\nIf a business sells personal information or discloses it for business purposes, consumers have the right to request the categories of information so sold or disclosed.</p>\n<p>Right to opt-out: Consumers have the right\u2014at any time\u2014to direct businesses that sell personal information about the consumer to third parties to stop this sale, known as the right to opt-out.\nIf a consumer is a minor, the CCPA provides for a right to opt-in to the sale of data (exercised by the minor if the consumer is between 13 and 16 years of age, or by the minor\u2019s parent or guardian if the consumer is under 13 years old).\nBusinesses must wait at least 12 months before asking consumers to opt back in.</p>\n<p>Right to request deletion: Consumers also have the right to request the deletion of personal information, but only where that information was collected from the consumer.\nLike the right to erasure under the GDPR, this right is subject to exceptions.\nFor instance, businesses need not delete personal information necessary for detecting security incidents, exercising free speech, protecting or defending against legal claims, or\u2014in what is potentially a broad and likely contentious category\u2014for internal uses reasonably aligned with the consumer\u2019s expectations.</p>\n<p>Right to equal services and prices: The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against consumers by denying goods or services, charging a different price or rate for goods or services, providing a different level or quality of goods or services, or suggesting that they will do any of these things based upon a consumer\u2019s exercise of any CCPA rights.\nPut differently, consumers have a right to equal services and prices.</p>\n<p>Exercising your rights under the CCPA:</p>\n<p>According the law (see paragraph above), you are entitled to request specific pieces of personal information (as defined under the CCPA) that we have about you, the business purpose for which the personal information was collected, categories of personal information, categories of sources from which the personal information was collected, categories of personal information that we either shared, transferred, sold with a business purpose, categories of those third parties to which the personal information was sold for a business purpose.</p>\n<p>If you want to do such a request, you can write to privacy@admarketplace.com and we will respond within 45 days as per the law.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to verify your identity if you make such a request.</p>\n<p>However, we may not be able to respond to your request if it goes against applicable law.\n(Please note that we do transfer personal information collected through our network of partners to third parties and as such are considered as having disclosed or sold data (as defined under the CCPA) over the past twelve months.)</p>\n<p>\n<b>Opt-Out Request Form Effective Date: Jan 1st,
