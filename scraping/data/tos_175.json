residents </li>\n<li>How we make changes to this policy </li>\n<li>Contact us </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Summary of changes <ul>\n<li>\n<p>We added more details about data we collect and how it's used, along with a new way to control whether it is used to report on ads performance.</p>\n<p>We added new information for our California residents.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Thank you for using Pinterest! <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.\nTo do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you\u2019ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and third parties.\nWe only use that information where we have a proper legal basis for doing so.</p>\n<p>\nWe wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it.\nBecause we\u2019re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we\u2019ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.\nWe welcome your questions and comments on this policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> We collect information in a few different ways <ul>\n<li> 1.\nWhen you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it\n<p>When you sign up for or use Pinterest you voluntarily share certain information including your name, email address, phone number, photos, Pins, comments, and any other information you give us.\nYou can also choose to share your precise location using your device settings or through photos.\nWe will still use your IP address, which is used to approximate your location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location.\nYou will also have the option&nbsp;to share other information about yourself such as your gender, age and preferred language.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nIf you connect your Facebook, Google or other third-party accounts to Pinterest, we use information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts) to improve your Pinterest experience.\nThis is dependent on the privacy policies or settings for those accounts.</p>\n2.\nWe also get technical information when you use Pinterest\n<p>When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically.\nThis is also true when you use Pinterest.\nHere are some of the types of information we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log data.</strong> When you use Pinterest, our servers record information (\u201clog data\u201d), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you\u2019re using it.\nThis log data includes your Internet Protocol address (which we use to infer your approximate location), the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the \u201cSave\u201d button\u2014more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Pinterest, cookie data and device data.\nYou can learn more about the log data we collect here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookie data.</strong> We also use \u201ccookies\u201d (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser) or similar technologies to get log data.\nWhen we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).\nFor example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don\u2018t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest.\nSome of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not.\nFor more detailed information about how we use cookies, please review our Cookie&nbsp;Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Device information.</strong> In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you\u2019re using Pinterest on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clickstream data and inferences.</strong> When you\u2019re on Pinterest, we use your activity\u2014such as which Pins you click on, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description\u2014along with information you provided when you first signed up&nbsp;and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences.\nFor example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast.\nWe may also infer information about your education or professional experience based on your activity when you link your account to accounts you have with third parties like Facebook or Google.</li>\n</ul>3.\nOur partners and advertisers share information with us\n<p>We also get information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some websites or apps use Pinterest features such as our \u201cSave\u201d button, or you may install our \u201cSave\u201d button for your browser.\nIf so, we collect log data from those sites or apps.\nYou can learn more about these features at our Help Center.</li>\n<li>Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you on or off of Pinterest.\nThis includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads.\nLearn more about the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> What we do with the info we collect <ul>\n<li> We\u2019re committed to showing you content that\u2019s relevant, interesting and personal to you.\nTo do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Identify you when you use Pinterest.</li>\n<li>Recommend Pins, boards, topics or categories you might like based on your activity on Pinterest.\nFor example, if we see you\u2019re into cooking, we may suggest food-related Pins, boards or people that we think you might like, or show you food-related ads.</li>\n<li>Respond to your questions or comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest for using your info in these ways.\nIt's fundamental to what we do at Pinterest and necessary in order to make Pinterest and its features relevant and personalized to you.</p>\n<p>We also have a legitimate interest in making Pinterest safe and improving&nbsp;our product features so you keep finding the inspiration you want.\nWe all benefit when we use your information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggest other people who have similar interests.\nFor example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like.</li>\n<li>Help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest, if you agree to this in your settings.\nFor example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we can help your Facebook friends find you on Pinterest when they first sign up for Pinterest.\nOr people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email.</li>\n<li>Work with law enforcement and keep Pinterest safe.\nWe may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts.\nTo find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines.</li>\n<li>Review your messages on Pinterest to detect activity that poses a risk to the safety of you, our community and/or members of the public.</li>\n<li>Conduct analytics and research on who is using Pinterest and what they are doing.\nFor example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better.</li>\n<li>Improve Pinterest and offer new features.</li>\n<li>Advertise Pinterest products and services to you on other sites.\nYou can choose for us not to share your information with other sites to personalize those ads as described in the \u201cChoices you have about your information\u201d section below.</li>\n<li>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like saves or comments, happens on Pinterest) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings.\nFor example, we send weekly updates that include Pins you may like.\nYou can decide to stop getting these notifications by updating your settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you in order to generate revenue.\nTo further these interests we use the information we collect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decide which ads to show you.\nFor example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest, we may show you ads for other outdoor products.\nWe customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties.\nWhere we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we\u2019ll get your consent where we need to.\nWhere ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they already obtained.</li>\n<li>Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better.\nSome of this information is aggregated.\nFor example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Promoted Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site.\nIn other instances, this information isn\u2019t aggregated.\nFor example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Promoted Pin has been saved by certain people.\nTo find out more about reporting on ads&nbsp;please visit the Help Center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your Pinterest experience based on your offsite behavior.\nFor example, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you.\nWhen we identify your interests based on your offsite behavior with cookies, we will obtain any consent that we may need.\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie&nbsp;Policy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the specific circumstances above, we\u2019ll only use your information with your consent in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow searching with photos.\nFor example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items.\nYou can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.</li>\n<li>Send you marketing materials by email, text, push notification or phone call depending on your account or operating system settings.\nEach time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe.</li>\n<li>Identify your precise location and customize the content we show you.\nFor example, if we know that you\u2019re near a retailer we may show you that retailer\u2019s Pins that may be of interest to you.\nYou can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.</li>\n<li>Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the Pinterest Tag.\nThe Pinterest Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on Pinterest.\nTo learn more about the Pinterest Tag, please visit the Help Center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify you across different browser sessions.\nThis means if you log into Pinterest from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and then you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit Pinterest.</li>\n<li>Show you ads you might be interested in.\nWe use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite activity.\nWe do this for people currently using Pinterest and for new folks, and it helps us customize how you get started on Pinterest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find out more about how we use cookies, and your choices about how we use them, please see our Cookie&nbsp;Policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Transferring your information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pinterest is a worldwide service.\nBy using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy.\nThe privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.</p>\n<p>See the section for EEA Residents to learn more about data transfers to and from that region.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Choices you have about your info <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information.\nIf you have a Pinterest account, many of these controls are built directly into Pinterest or your settings.\nFor example, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Edit information in your profile at any time, decide whether your profile is available to search engines, or choose whether others can find your Pinterest account using your email address.</li>\n<li>Link or unlink your Pinterest account from other services (like Facebook, Google or Twitter).\nFor some services (like Facebook), you can also decide whether or not to publish your Pinterest activity to that service.</li>\n<li>Edit secret board settings.\nSecret boards are visible to you and other collaborators in the board, and any collaborator may choose to make the board available to anyone else.\nFor example, another collaborator can invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends.</li>\n<li>Choose whether Pinterest will be customized for you using information from other websites or apps.\nIf you have a Pinterest account and want to control how your offsite data is used to tailor your experience, you can visit your settings and update your \u201cPersonalization\u201d preferences.</li>\n<li>Choose whether Pinterest ads delivered to you on other platforms, sites or apps are customized using information about your account activities.\nYou&nbsp;can control this by visiting&nbsp;your settings&nbsp;and updating&nbsp;your \u201cPersonalization\u201d preferences.</li>\n<li>Choose whether Pinterest shares information about your activity on Pinterest for ads performance reporting.\nYou can control this by visiting your settings and updating your \u201cPersonalization\u201d preferences.</li>\n<li>Close your account at any time.\nWhen you close your account, we\u2019ll deactivate it, remove your Pins and boards from Pinterest and delete your account data.&nbsp;Please note that there may be legal reasons for us to keep your data, such as if we receive a law enforcement request asking us to preserve data.\nWe may also retain certain information in our backup systems for a limited period of time, or as required by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also support settings such as Limit Ad Tracking in iOS, Ads Personalization in Android devices as well as Do Not Track in browsers.&nbsp;Learn more about how Do Not Track affects our collection and use of data collected off of Pinterest.</p>\n<p>You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The browser you use lets you control cookies or other types of local data storage.</li>\n<li>Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your precise location, photos, contacts and other data is shared with us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by your device or software provider.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul> How and when we share information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Anyone can see the public boards and Pins you create and profile information you give us.\nWe also make this public information available through what are called APIs (basically a technical way to share information quickly).\nFor example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API.\nWe also share your information with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other services, at your direction, to enable you to sign up for or log in to Pinterest, or when you decide to link your Pinterest account to those services, like Facebook or Google, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to them.\nFor example, if you choose to publish your Pins to Facebook or Twitter, then information about that content will be shared&nbsp;with Facebook or Twitter.</li>\n<li>Services we use to market Pinterest to you on sites and apps other than Pinterest, such as Facebook Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Microsoft Advertising, LinkedIn Advertising, The Trade Desk and others from time to time.\nYou can opt-out of sharing with such advertising services in your settings.</li>\n<li>Online advertisers and third-party companies that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps (for example, through Google Analytics).\nThis includes us sharing the Pins or ads you were shown on Pinterest and whether or how you engaged with those Pins or ads, or other information about your activity on Pinterest.\nLearn more about how we share information with online advertisers.\nTo learn more about third-party companies that analyze ad performance, please visit our Help Center.</li>\n<li>Third-party companies, service providers or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nFor example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam.\nSome information we acquire may be collected by third-party providers on our behalf.</li>\n<li>Law enforcement agencies or government agencies.\nWe only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request.\nto protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest.\nor to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>\n<li>Our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates.\nIf we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> How long we keep your information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy.\nThis is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf.\nWhen we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we\u2019ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Our policy on children\u2019s information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Children under

country.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Your options <ul>\n<li>\n<p>You have options in relation to the information that we have about you.\nTo exercise these options, please visit your account settings and, if you still need help, our Help Center.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to the information we collect and hold about you.\nWe'll usually share this with you within 30 days of you asking us for it through

your information.\nYou can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your information to send you marketing emails or push notifications.\nIf you opt out of receiving marketing

where we hold this information with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, and, where it's technically feasible for us to do so.</li>\n<li>Request more details about the information we collect and how and why we use and share it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise your options related to your personal information.\nWe work

right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission in Ireland or with your local supervisory authority.</p>\n<p>Because Pinterest is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EEA residents to a country outside the EEA.&nbsp;Where we transfer information from the EEA to a country that doesn't provide an adequate level of protection, we\u2019ll only do so under appropriate safeguards to protect your information, like standard contractual clauses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> California residents <ul>\n<li>\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to

of Service.\nIf you do open an account for a company, organization, or other entity, then \"you\" includes you and that entity, and you promise that you are authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these Terms and bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these Terms on the entity's behalf.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>You cannot use Pinterest if you're under 13 (or older in some countries).\nAlso, if you are using Pinterest for work, you need to set up a business account.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 3.\nYour content <ul>\n<li> a.\nPosting content <p>Pinterest allows you to post content, including photos, comments, links, and other materials.\nAnything that you post or otherwise make available on Pinterest is referred to as \"User Content.\" You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to Pinterest.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>If you post your content on Pinterest, it still belongs to

store, display, reproduce, save, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute your User Content on Pinterest solely for the purposes of operating, developing, providing, and using Pinterest.\nNothing in these Terms restricts other legal rights Pinterest may have to User Content, for example under other licenses.\nWe reserve the right to remove or modify User Content, or change the way it\u2019s used in Pinterest, for any reason.\nThis includes User Content that we believe violates these Terms, our Community Guidelines, or any other policies.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>If you post your content on Pinterest, we can show it to people and others can save it.\nDon't post porn or spam or be a jerk to other people on Pinterest.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n<li> c.\nHow long we keep your content <p>Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User Content from Pinterest, we may keep your User Content for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.\nPinterest and its users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, re-pin, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your

please read our Copyright Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>We respect copyrights.\nYou should, too.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 5.\nSecurity <ul>\n<li>\n<p>We care about the security of our users.\nWhile we work to protect the security of your content and account, Pinterest can\u2019t guarantee that unauthorized third parties won\u2019t be able to defeat our security measures.\nWe ask that you keep your password secure.\nPlease notify us immediately of any compromise or unauthorized use of your account.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>You can help us fight spammers by keeping these security tips in mind.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 6.\nThird party links, sites, and services <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pinterest may contain links to third party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Pinterest.\nWe don\u2019t endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third party sites, information, materials, products, or services.\nIf you access any third party website, service, or content from Pinterest, you do so at your own risk and you agree that Pinterest has no liability arising from your use of or access to any third party website, service, or content.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>Pinterest has links to content off of Pinterest.\nMost of that stuff is awesome, but we're not responsible when it's not.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 7.\nTermination <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pinterest may terminate or suspend your right to access or use Pinterest for any reason on appropriate notice.\nWe may terminate or suspend your access immediately and without notice if we have a good reason, including any violation of our Community Guidelines.\nUpon termination, you continue to be bound by Sections 3 and 8 of these Terms.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>Pinterest is provided to you for free.\nWe reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, but we will provide appropriate notice.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 8.\nIndemnity <ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you use Pinterest for commercial purposes (i.e., you are not a consumer) without agreeing to our Business Terms as required by Section 2(c) of these Terms, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pinterest Inc, Pinterest Europe Ltd, their affiliates and their&nbsp;respective officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, suits, proceedings, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (including costs of defense of claims, suits or proceedings brought by third parties), in any way related to your access to or use of our Service, your User Content, or&nbsp;your breach of any of these Terms.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>If we are sued because of something your business does on Pinterest, you have to pay our costs.\nAlso, you should have created a business account and agreed to our Business Terms in the first place.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 9.\nDisclaimers <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our Service and all content on Pinterest is provided on an \"as is\" basis without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied.</p>\n<p>Pinterest specifically disclaims any and all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.</p>\n<p>Pinterest takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other person or third party posts or sends using our Service.\nYou understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that\u2019s inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose.</p>\n<p>If you're a consumer in the EEA, we don\u2019t exclude or limit any liability for gross negligence, intent, or death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>Unfortunately, people post bad stuff on services like Pinterest.\nWe take that kind of thing seriously but you still might run into it before we have a chance to take it down.\nIf you see bad stuff, please report it to us here.&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 10.\nLimitation of liability <ul>\n<li>\n<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, PINTEREST SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.\n(B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES.\nOR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL PINTEREST'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S.\nDOLLARS (U.S.\n$100.00).</p>\n<p>If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn\u2019t apply.\nInstead, Pinterest\u2019s liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract.\nPinterest isn\u2019t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care.\nThis limitation of liability won\u2019t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>We are building the best service we can for you but we can't promise it will be perfect.\nWe're not liable for various things.\nIf you think we are, let's try to work it out like adults.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 11.\nArbitration <ul>\n<li>\n<p>For any dispute you have with Pinterest, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute with us informally.\nIf we need to contact you, we will do so at the email address on your Pinterest account.\nIf Pinterest hasn\u2019t been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms through binding arbitration or (for qualifying claims) in small claims court.</p>\n<p>Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court.\nFor instance, arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, involves more limited discovery, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nAlthough the process is more informal, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Service, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThe arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your Pinterest account.</p>\n<p>Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.\nYou can find their forms at www.adr.org.\nUnless you and Pinterest agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county (or parish) where you reside.\nEach party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules, except that Pinterest will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts, including for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service.\nALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS.\nYOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND PINTEREST ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>\n<p>NOTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE&nbsp;SHALL AFFECT ANY NON-WAIVABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS THAT APPLY TO YOU.\nTo the extent any claim, dispute or controversy regarding Pinterest or our Service isn\u2019t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise: you and Pinterest both agree that any claim or dispute regarding Pinterest will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms.</p>\n<p>If you're a consumer in the EEA, Section 11 doesn't apply to you.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 12.\nGoverning law and jurisdiction <ul>\n<li>\n<p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.\nIf you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is San Francisco County, California, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and our dispute will be determined under California law.</p>\n<p>If you are a consumer in the EEA, this won\u2019t deprive you of any protection you have under the law of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country.&nbsp;<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>The Bay Area is beautiful this time of year.\nIt doesn't matter what time of year it is, that's what's so great! Anyway, you'll have to sue us here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the EEA, this applies if you're a merchant, but not if you're a consumer.\nIf you are a consumer in the EEA, you can sue us in your home courts.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 13.\nGeneral terms <ul>\n<li> Notification procedures and changes to these Terms <p>We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if that\u2019s what we decide.\nWe may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website.\nIf a revision, in our discretion, is material, we\u2019ll notify you.\nBy continuing to access or use Pinterest after revisions become effective, you agree&nbsp;to be bound by the new Terms.\nIf you don\u2019t agree to the new terms, please stop using Pinterest.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>If we're making a big change to the terms, we'll let you know.\nIf you don\u2019t like the new terms, please stop using Pinterest.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Assignment <p>These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Pinterest without restriction.\nAny attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a consumer in the EEA, either you or Pinterest may assign this agreement, and any rights and licences granted under it, to a third party.\nIn case of such an assignment by Pinterest, you are entitled to terminate the agreement with immediate effect by deactivating your account.\nPinterest will provide you with reasonable notice of any such assignment.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Entire agreement/severability <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Pinterest shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Pinterest concerning the Service.\nIf any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n</li>\n<li> No waiver <p>No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Pinterest's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>\n</li>\n<li> Parties <p>If you live in the United States, these Terms are a contract between you and Pinterest Inc., 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103.\nIf you live outside the United States, these Terms are a contract between you and Pinterest Europe Ltd., an Irish company with its registered office at Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>\n<strong> More simply put </strong>\n<p>Who you deal with depends on where you live.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Effective May 1, 2018</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Pinterest is using cookies to help give you the best experience we can.</strong> Got it!

data we collect and how it's used, along with a new way to control whether it is used to report on ads performance.</p>\n<p>We added new information for our California residents.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Thank you for using Pinterest! <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our mission is to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.\nTo do that, we show you personalized content and ads we think you\u2019ll be interested in based on information we collect from you and third parties.\nWe only use that information where we have a proper legal basis for doing so.</p>\n<p>\nWe wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it.\nBecause we\u2019re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we\u2019ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way.\nWe welcome your questions and comments on this policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> We collect information in a few different ways <ul>\n<li> 1.\nWhen you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it\n<p>When you sign up for or use Pinterest you voluntarily share certain information including your name, email address, phone number, photos, Pins, comments, and any other information you give us.\nYou can also choose to share your precise location using your device settings or through photos.\nWe will still use your IP address, which is used to approximate your location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location.\nYou will also have the option&nbsp;to share other information about yourself such as your gender, age and preferred language.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\nIf you connect your Facebook, Google or other third-party accounts to Pinterest, we use information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts) to improve your Pinterest experience.\nThis is dependent on the privacy policies or settings for those accounts.</p>\n2.\nWe also get technical information when you use Pinterest\n<p>When you use a website, mobile application or other internet service, certain internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically.\nThis is also true when you use Pinterest.\nHere are some of the types of information we collect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Log data.</strong> When you use Pinterest, our servers record information (\u201clog data\u201d), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you\u2019re using it.\nThis log data includes your Internet Protocol address (which we use to infer your approximate location), the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the \u201cSave\u201d button\u2014more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Pinterest, cookie data and device data.\nYou can learn more about the log data we collect here.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookie data.</strong> We also use \u201ccookies\u201d (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser) or similar technologies to get log data.\nWhen we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them).\nFor example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don\u2018t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest.\nSome of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not.\nFor more detailed information about how we use cookies, please review our Cookie&nbsp;Policy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Device information.</strong> In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you\u2019re using Pinterest on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Clickstream data and inferences.</strong> When you\u2019re on Pinterest, we use your activity\u2014such as which Pins you click on, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description\u2014along with information you provided when you first signed up&nbsp;and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences.\nFor example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast.\nWe may also infer information about your education or professional experience based on your activity when you link your account to accounts you have with third parties like Facebook or Google.</li>\n</ul>3.\nOur partners and advertisers share information with us\n<p>We also get information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some websites or apps use Pinterest features such as our \u201cSave\u201d button, or you may install our \u201cSave\u201d button for your browser.\nIf so, we collect log data from those sites or apps.\nYou can learn more about these features at our Help Center.</li>\n<li>Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to figure out what kinds of ads to show you on or off of Pinterest.\nThis includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads.\nLearn more about the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> What we do with the info we collect <ul>\n<li> We\u2019re committed to showing you content that\u2019s relevant, interesting and personal to you.\nTo do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Identify you when you use Pinterest.</li>\n<li>Recommend Pins, boards, topics or categories you might like based on your activity on Pinterest.\nFor example, if we see you\u2019re into cooking, we may suggest food-related Pins, boards or people that we think you might like, or show you food-related ads.</li>\n<li>Respond to your questions or comments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest for using your info in these ways.\nIt's fundamental to what we do at Pinterest and necessary in order to make Pinterest and its features relevant and personalized to you.</p>\n<p>We also have a legitimate interest in making Pinterest safe and improving&nbsp;our product features so you keep finding the inspiration you want.\nWe all benefit when we use your information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggest other people who have similar interests.\nFor example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like.</li>\n<li>Help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest, if you agree to this in your settings.\nFor example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we can help your Facebook friends find you on Pinterest when they first sign up for Pinterest.\nOr people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email.</li>\n<li>Work with law enforcement and keep Pinterest safe.\nWe may get requests for account information from law enforcement authorities like the police or courts.\nTo find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines.</li>\n<li>Review your messages on Pinterest to detect activity that poses a risk to the safety of you, our community and/or members of the public.</li>\n<li>Conduct analytics and research on who is using Pinterest and what they are doing.\nFor example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better.</li>\n<li>Improve Pinterest and offer new features.</li>\n<li>Advertise Pinterest products and services to you on other sites.\nYou can choose for us not to share your information with other sites to personalize those ads as described in the \u201cChoices you have about your information\u201d section below.</li>\n<li>Send you updates (such as when certain activity, like saves or comments, happens on Pinterest) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings.\nFor example, we send weekly updates that include Pins you may like.\nYou can decide to stop getting these notifications by updating your settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you in order to generate revenue.\nTo further these interests we use the information we collect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decide which ads to show you.\nFor example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest, we may show you ads for other outdoor products.\nWe customize the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties.\nWhere we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we\u2019ll get your consent where we need to.\nWhere ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they already obtained.</li>\n<li>Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better.\nSome of this information is aggregated.\nFor example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed a Promoted Pin went on to visit that advertiser's site.\nIn other instances, this information isn\u2019t aggregated.\nFor example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular Promoted Pin has been saved by certain people.\nTo find out more about reporting on ads&nbsp;please visit the Help Center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customize your Pinterest experience based on your offsite behavior.\nFor example, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar Pins to you.\nWhen we identify your interests based on your offsite behavior with cookies, we will obtain any consent that we may need.\nTo find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie&nbsp;Policy.</p>\n<p>In addition to the specific circumstances above, we\u2019ll only use your information with your consent in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow searching with photos.\nFor example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items.\nYou can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.</li>\n<li>Send you marketing materials by email, text, push notification or phone call depending on your account or operating system settings.\nEach time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe.</li>\n<li>Identify your precise location and customize the content we show you.\nFor example, if we know that you\u2019re near a retailer we may show you that retailer\u2019s Pins that may be of interest to you.\nYou can opt in to this in your device operating system settings.</li>\n<li>Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the Pinterest Tag.\nThe Pinterest Tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on Pinterest.\nTo learn more about the Pinterest Tag, please visit the Help Center.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We\u2019ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify you across different browser sessions.\nThis means if you log into Pinterest from your phone (or any device), we'll remember that you're you and then you won't need to enter your login details each time you visit Pinterest.</li>\n<li>Show you ads you might be interested in.\nWe use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite activity.\nWe do this for people currently using Pinterest and for new folks, and it helps us customize how you get started on Pinterest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To find out more about how we use cookies, and your choices about how we use them, please see our Cookie&nbsp;Policy.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Transferring your information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pinterest is a worldwide service.\nBy using our products or services, you authorize us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy.\nThe privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your personal information in such countries may not be equivalent to those of your home country.</p>\n<p>See the section for EEA Residents to learn more about data transfers to and from that region.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Choices you have about your info <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices regarding your information.\nIf you have a Pinterest account, many of these controls are built directly into Pinterest or your settings.\nFor example, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Edit information in your profile at any time, decide whether your profile is available to search engines, or choose whether others can find your Pinterest account using your email address.</li>\n<li>Link or unlink your Pinterest account from other services (like Facebook, Google or Twitter).\nFor some services (like Facebook), you can also decide whether or not to publish your Pinterest activity to that service.</li>\n<li>Edit secret board settings.\nSecret boards are visible to you and other collaborators in the board, and any collaborator may choose to make the board available to anyone else.\nFor example, another collaborator can invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends.</li>\n<li>Choose whether Pinterest will be customized for you using information from other websites or apps.\nIf you have a Pinterest account and want to control how your offsite data is used to tailor your experience, you can visit your settings and update your \u201cPersonalization\u201d preferences.</li>\n<li>Choose whether Pinterest ads delivered to you on other platforms, sites or apps are customized using information about your account activities.\nYou&nbsp;can control this by visiting&nbsp;your settings&nbsp;and updating&nbsp;your \u201cPersonalization\u201d preferences.</li>\n<li>Choose whether Pinterest shares information about your activity on Pinterest for ads performance reporting.\nYou can control this by visiting your settings and updating your \u201cPersonalization\u201d preferences.</li>\n<li>Close your account at any time.\nWhen you close your account, we\u2019ll deactivate it, remove your Pins and boards from Pinterest and delete your account data.&nbsp;Please note that there may be legal reasons for us to keep your data, such as if we receive a law enforcement request asking us to preserve data.\nWe may also retain certain information in our backup systems for a limited period of time, or as required by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We also support settings such as Limit Ad Tracking in iOS, Ads Personalization in Android devices as well as Do Not Track in browsers.&nbsp;Learn more about how Do Not Track affects our collection and use of data collected off of Pinterest.</p>\n<p>You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest.\nFor example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The browser you use lets you control cookies or other types of local data storage.</li>\n<li>Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your precise location, photos, contacts and other data is shared with us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by your device or software provider.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul> How and when we share information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Anyone can see the public boards and Pins you create and profile information you give us.\nWe also make this public information available through what are called APIs (basically a technical way to share information quickly).\nFor example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API.\nWe also share your information with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Other services, at your direction, to enable you to sign up for or log in to Pinterest, or when you decide to link your Pinterest account to those services, like Facebook or Google, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to them.\nFor example, if you choose to publish your Pins to Facebook or Twitter, then information about that content will be shared&nbsp;with Facebook or Twitter.</li>\n<li>Services we use to market Pinterest to you on sites and apps other than Pinterest, such as Facebook Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Microsoft Advertising, LinkedIn Advertising, The Trade Desk and others from time to time.\nYou can opt-out of sharing with such advertising services in your settings.</li>\n<li>Online advertisers and third-party companies that we or they use to audit or improve the delivery and performance of ads or content on websites and apps (for example, through Google Analytics).\nThis includes us sharing the Pins or ads you were shown on Pinterest and whether or how you engaged with those Pins or ads, or other information about your activity on Pinterest.\nLearn more about how we share information with online advertisers.\nTo learn more about third-party companies that analyze ad performance, please visit our Help Center.</li>\n<li>Third-party companies, service providers or individuals that we employ to process information on our behalf based on our instructions and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nFor example, we share data with security consultants to help us get better at identifying spam.\nSome information we acquire may be collected by third-party providers on our behalf.</li>\n<li>Law enforcement agencies or government agencies.\nWe only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request.\nto protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Pinterest.\nor to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li>\n<li>Our wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates.\nIf we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> How long we keep your information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy.\nThis is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf.\nWhen we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we\u2019ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Our policy on children\u2019s information <ul>\n<li>\n<p>Children under 13 are not allowed to use Pinterest.\nIf you are based in the EEA you may only use Pinterest if you are over the age at which you can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your country.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Your options <ul>\n<li>\n<p>You have options in relation to the information that we have about you.\nTo exercise these options, please visit your account settings and, if you still need help, our Help Center.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Request access to the information we collect and hold about you.\nWe'll usually share this with you within 30 days of you asking us for it through our Help Center.</li>\n<li>Have your information corrected or deleted.\nYou can update your information in your profile or delete your data by closing your account.</li>\n<li>Object to us processing your information.\nYou can ask us to stop using your information, including when we use your information to send you marketing emails or push notifications.\nIf you opt out of receiving marketing messages from us, we may still send you updates about your account, such as when someone comments on one of your Pins.</li>\n<li>Have the information you provided to us sent to another organization, where we hold this information with your consent or for the performance of a contract with you, and, where it's technically feasible for us to do so.</li>\n<li>Request more details about the information we collect and how and why we use and share it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will not discriminate against you if you choose to exercise your options related to your personal information.\nWe work to be clear with you about your options and the consequences of exercising certain options.\nIf you have questions, please contact us.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Residents of the EEA <ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you have any questions about our data processing activities, the data controller you should contact is Pinterest Europe Ltd., an Irish company with its registered office at Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, Ireland.\nYou can also contact our Data Protection Officer.</p>\n<p>If you think that we haven't complied with data protection laws, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the Data Protection Commission in Ireland or with your local supervisory authority.</p>\n<p>Because Pinterest is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EEA residents to a country outside the EEA.&nbsp;Where we transfer information from the EEA to a country that doesn't provide an adequate level of protection, we\u2019ll only do so under appropriate safeguards to protect your information, like standard contractual clauses.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> California residents <ul>\n<li>\n<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to
