One of the most interesting occurrences recently with the site updating it's Terms of Service (an old copies can be found here: https://archive.vn/https://alanthomsonsim.com/?page_id=621) where it added a phrase on banning users for account sharing (which it had already been doing before the Terms of Service were changed.).

I haven't even received any emails before about any of the ToS changes that may have occured without my knowledge since I signed up to the site (on the 25th of May 2020).
