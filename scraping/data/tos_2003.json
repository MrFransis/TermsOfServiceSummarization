Sovereignty<br>\n</strong>\n<p>Nearly all countries have laws that protect personal data privacy.\nSome countries require that personal data be stored exclusively on servers located in-country.\nFurther, some countries limit the transfer of personal data outside of their jurisdiction.<br>\n<br>ClassLink software and systems are designed to comply with these various regulations as follows:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.<br>\n</li>\n<li>ClassLink software enables the customer to control when and how their data is shared with third party vendors.<br>\n</li>\n<li>ClassLink customers have the option to host a dedicated ClassLink data server either within their internal data center or utilize a secure data center located within the jurisdiction.<br>\n</li>\n<li>ClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>European Union \u2013 General Data Protection Regulation (</strong>\n<strong>GDPR</strong>\n<strong>)</strong>\n<p>GDPR is the newest body of regulation regarding the handling of personal data for citizens of the European Union (EU).\nThe primary objective of the GDPR is to give citizens control of their personal data.\n&nbsp;Select ClassLink products are compliant with the EU General Data Protection Regulation.<br>\n<br>GDPR includes 11 chapters and nearly 100 articles.\nBelow are some of the most relevant articles.<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Article 5 \u201cPrinciples relating to processing of personal data\u201d: ClassLink is a trusted steward of personal data.\nData received from customers are to be used solely for purposes of providing educational services.\nSuch data will not be sold or used for marketing purposes.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Article 17 \u201cRight to be forgotten\u201d: Schools can choose to delete users from ClassLink at any

ClassLink.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Article 32 \u201cSecurity of processing\u201d: ClassLink keeps all personal data confidential and secure.\nClassLink team members are bound by contractual non-disclosure agreements.\nClassLink\u2019s data security protections include: internal data management policies and procedures, limitations on access to personal data, data encryption (for both data in transit and

networks.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Article 33 \u201cNotification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority\u201d: GDPR requires notice to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of awareness of a personal data breach.\nDiscovery of a security breach that results in an unauthorized release of personal data: ClassLink shall promptly notify affected customers of such breach, shall conduct an investigation, and shall restore the integrity of its data systems as soon as possible.\nClassLink will fully cooperate and assist with required notices to those individuals affected by such breach.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Article 35: \u201cData protection impact assessment\u201d: ClassLink conducts various security assessments of our systems.\nCertain security tests are conducted annually,

officer who is authorized to engage security reviews and impact product development.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Article 44: \u201cGeneral principle for transfers\u201d: To promote data sovereignty/data residency in GDPR, the regulation authorizes the European Commission to decide if a third country or territory, where data may be transferred, meets adequate levels of protection.\nAs GDPR is new, no third country or territory has yet been approved by the Commission.\nClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.\nCustomers located in the EU or UK <strong>\n</strong>utilize a secure data center located within the EU zone (Frankfurt, Germany).\nNo servers, outside of these options, are used to store data for EU or UK based

participating organizations is available at&nbsp;www.privacyshield.gov/list.<br>\n<br>On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, invalidated the privacy shield as a substitute for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nPrivacy Shield continues to be in effect for Switzerland.\nA key factor contributing to the invalidation was the permissible transfer of personal data from the EU to the US under certain circumstances.\nClassLink customers are always in control over the storage and transmission of their personal data.\nClassLink software and system processes can only transmit personal data with the express instruction of the customer.<br>\n<br>ClassLink continues to participate in Privacy Shield and adhere to its guiding principles for the
