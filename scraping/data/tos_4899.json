you read this Privacy Statement carefully as it contains important information about what personal data we collect from you and how we will use it.\nAny questions you may have regarding this Privacy Statement are welcomed and should be sent to&nbsp;james@bearable.app.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Statement should be read in conjunction with our&nbsp;Terms &amp.\nConditions.\nWe strongly encourage you to review this Privacy Statement and Terms &amp.\nConditions carefully and ensure that they contain nothing that you are not prepared to agree to, before you decide to accept the Terms &amp.\nConditions and use our Bearable App or our website (www.bearable.app).</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> about us<p>BEARABLE Limited is a company registered in England and Wales with company registration number 12089632.\nOur registered office is at Symal House Suite C2, 423 Edgware Road, London, United Kingdom, NW9 0HU</p>\n<p>For the purpose of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and the Data Protection Act 2018 (together \u201cData Protection Legislation\u201d), we are the \u2018data controller\u2019 (i.e.\nthe company which determines the purposes and means of the processing of your personal data).</p>\n<p>Bearable has appointed a Data Protection Officer, who can be contacted at&nbsp.\nJames@bearable.app.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> How we process your data at bearable<p>To register an account, you have to enter your email address and choose a password.&nbsp.\nYou may also register using a Google Account or Facebook.&nbsp.\nOnce you have registered, you will benefit from the following functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Automatic backup to our secure servers.\nas well as the ability to restore and recover your account and it\u2019s associated data on another device</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use the Bearable app or when you go on our website, some personal and non-personal data is collected, stored, and analyzed using internal and third-party tools.</p>\n<p>There are <strong>two main purposes</strong> for which we process personal data and the type of data that is processed to fulfil each purpose:</p>\n<strong>1.\nTo provide our services and understand your needs</strong>\n<p>First and foremost it is vital for us to stress that we do not and will never sell any personal data about you to third parties.&nbsp.\nHowever you may still feel uncomfortable storing health information to a connected device.&nbsp.\nTherefore, you should consider the safety and privacy of your personal data before using the Bearable app generally, and utilising the export feature of the app specifically.&nbsp.\nYou should refrain from sharing or exporting data unless you are certain that the receiving email address is authorised, credible, and secure.</p>\n<p>When you use the Bearable app,&nbsp.\nor when you go on our website, Bearable collects, stores, and uses some personal and non-personal data.&nbsp.\nWe mainly do this to provide you with our services, and our lawful basis for this processing is that it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (i.e.\nour Terms and Conditions).</p>\n<p>We may also occasionally send you informational and promotional messages as well as reminders to your smartphone via push notifications.&nbsp.\nWe will only send you such messages with your prior consent.</p>\n<p>We are very thoughtful and selective about what we communicate and how often.\nYou always remain in full control of your communication preferences with Bearable.\nYou can change the settings within the app at anytime.</p>\n<p>We also process your personal data in order to understand your needs and your use of our app and website, to analyze bugs and fix issues, and to bring you more useful features.&nbsp.\nTo sum it up, we process this data to provide you the best and most reliable experience of our services.&nbsp.\nThese processing activities are based on our legitimate interests in providing a reliable service to you, and improving it.</p>\n<p>We do not process personal data that directly identifies you as a person (such as your first name, surname, email).</p>\n<p>These are the types of data we collect for the above purposes:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device data</strong>\n<br>This data informs us about the device you use to access our services, such as the model, name and identifiers, device settings, the application identifier, and crash information.\nOn our website, we collect information about your browser and browser settings, the operating system you use, and the system settings of your device.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Event and usage data</strong>\n<br>When you use the app or when you go our website, our servers process anonymised data in order to understand your usage of our services, for example, which pages you visit or which tab in the app you open.\nWe collect this information and use it as aggregate data to allow us to better understand which features are the most relevant or useful to our users as whole, and to communicate with you about relevant and timely information and promotional content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>IP address</strong>\n<br>We collect IP addresses provided by your browser or mobile device to deliver the service to your device.\nWe also use the IP address to determine your approximate location for statistical and analytics purposes.</p>\n<p>All the data we collect at Bearable is necessary for us to deliver the services you use.\nThe amount we collect has been minimised wherever possible to respect your privacy.</p>\n<strong>To deliver personalised insights&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>The data you track in Bearable about your health and activities is considered <em>sensitive personal data</em>.&nbsp.\nBearable does not store sensitive personal data without your explicit consent.&nbsp.\nIt is only when you give us explicit consent by creating a Bearable account, and giving us your consent declaration, that we start storing all your health and sensitive data on our secured servers.</p>\n<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by simply deleting your account in the app.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is the type of data we collect and store when you create an account:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal data used for account creation</strong>\n<br>We need some of your personal data (only your email address) in order to create your Bearable account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Health and sensitive data</strong>\n<br>We store health data, such as your mood levels and individual symptom levels, your medication and supplements and other health factors you track in the app (e.g.\nsleep quality, exercise, diet and food diary, general daily activities such as work, tv, grocery shopping etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The provision of this information is entirely voluntary, and it is up to you how much information to input.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to clarify that your health data is encrypted safely on our services and the only personal data it is attached to is your email address.&nbsp.\nYou can find a detailed explanation of what you consent to when creating an account with Bearable in the next section of our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> Your consent for processing health and sensitive data<p>If you create an account with Bearable, your personal data, including sensitive data and data related to your health, is stored on your device and is also stored and processed on Bearable servers.\nThis is done so we can offer you the option of backing up your data and to enable additional features (such as the ability to transfer, restore, and recover data between Apple and Android devices).</p>\n<p>By creating an account with Bearable you explicitly consent that:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>i.\nBearable may store and process personal data you provide through the usage of the Bearable app and through the account creation process solely for the purpose of providing Bearable services to you and to improve Bearable\u2019s service features.\nSuch Bearable services may include sending you information and reminders through the Bearable app, e.g.\nvia push notification or to the email address you provided to Bearable, where you have separately agreed to receive such messages.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>ii.\nSuch personal data you provide to Bearable through the account creation process for the purpose of providing Bearable\u2019s service includes personal data you enter into the Bearable app, such as your account data (e.g.\nyour email address), and your health data which may include your mood levels and individual symptom levels, your medication and supplements and other health factors you track in the app (e.g.\nsleep quality, exercise, diet and food diary, general daily activities such as work, tv, meditation etc.).&nbsp.\n&nbsp;All of your health data is encrypted on the server end and cannot be read by anyone but yourself.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may withdraw your consent to this use of your data at any time by deleting your Bearable account.&nbsp.\nThis can be requested by e-mailing&nbsp;james@bearable.app.&nbsp.\nYou can also delete your data from the settings page within the Bearable App.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> Your rights<p>We believe that data privacy is a basic human right.\nAt BEARABLE we strive to ensure that your rights are respected.</p>\n<p>Here are some key facts about your privacy that we would like you to know:</p>\n<p>i.\nOur products and services have been designed to minimise the use of your personal data.\nWe only collect and process your personal data for the purposes that have been previously outlined.</p>\n<p>ii.\nYour data is highly secured on our servers (using the Firestore database, which encrypts all of your data, as seen here&nbsp;to protect your data from unauthorized access).\nYou can contact us at&nbsp;james@bearable.app&nbsp;if you have any questions about the security of our services.</p>\n<p>iii.\nWe do not retain your personal data in an identifiable format for longer than necessary to deliver our services.</p>\n<p>iv.\nBearable does not engage in any automated decision-making or profiling activities.</p>\n<p>As a user of Bearable\u2019s services and website, you may exercise your

electronically.</p>\n<p>ii.\nGain access to your personal data by requesting a backup of your data (as explained in the next section) in a format that is readable by other companies or organisations (data portability).</p>\n<p>iii.\nCorrect your personal data and health data in the app settings and in the tracking categories available in the Bearable app.</p>\n<p>iv.\nWithdraw your consent from data processing at any time by deleting your account (as explained in the support section of the app) and/or deleting the Bearable app from your smartphone, and/or unsubscribing from our newsletter by clicking the link at bottom of the email or by contacting&nbsp;james@bearable.app.</p>\n<p>v.\nRequest the complete deletion of your data, including all past data sent to third-party services used for tracking and analysis, by reaching out to james@bearable.app&nbsp;Your data will be deleted within 30 days.</p>\n<p>vi.\nObject to our processing of your personal data, or ask us to restrict your personal data pending a decision on whether we can lawfully continue to process it.</p>\n<p>vii.\nFile a complaint with the relevant supervising authority if you believe Bearable is processing your personal data under violation of applicable data protection regulations.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> Data Security<p>We apply security measures to protect against the misuse, loss, and/or alteration of personal data under our control.&nbsp.\nThough we cannot ensure or guarantee that misuse, loss or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.&nbsp.\nAlthough we make good faith efforts to store the non-public information entered into the App in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.\nWe cannot and do not guarantee that our security measures will prevent third party \u201chackers\u201d from illegally accessing our site or App and obtaining access to content or information thereon.</p>\n<strong>How Bearable stores your personal data</strong>\n<p>If you have an account with Bearable, your personal profile data (email address) is stored separately from your health (mood, symptoms, medication, your customised health factors) data and your service settings.\nThis allows us to ensure the highest possible level of privacy for your health data.\nYour password is stored using one-way encryption (\u201chashing\u201d plus \u201csalting\u201d) and it cannot be read by us.</p>\n<p>Your data is transmitted between your device and Bearable\u2019s servers using the HTTPS protocol for encryption.\nHTTPS is the same technology used to create secure connections for your web browser and is indicated by a padlock icon in the URL bar of your browser.</p>\n<strong>Disclosure of your personal data&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>We will share some of your personal data with third parties outside Bearable only where it is strictly necessary to provide our services to you, where required by law or where we have another legitimate interest to do so.&nbsp.\nPersonal data may be shared in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical Service Providers: For example: technology service providers, payment providers, data storage providers, and marketing platforms (e.g.\nfor sending marketing emails),</li>\n<li>Third Party Apps: some of your personal data may be shared with such Apps.&nbsp.\nPlease see the section below for further information.</li>\n<li>When required to do so by law, regulation or court order;</li>\n<li>in response to a legitimate request for assistance by the police or other law enforcement agency;</li>\n<li>to seek legal advice from Bearable\u2019s external lawyers or in connection with litigation with a third party.\nor</li>\n<li>in connection with the sale, purchase or merger of our business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Bearable\u2019s recommendations for protecting your personal data</strong>\n<p>We believe the biggest threat to the security and privacy of your personal data is if someone, probably someone you know, gains access to any of your devices.\nThe data you enter into Bearable is private and it should stay that way.\nWe have outlined some ways to keep your devices secure below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Protect your device:</strong>\n<br>i.\nActivate either PIN, TouchID (iPhone 5S models onwards), or FaceID (iPhone X onwards) authentication for your device.\nThis automatically encrypts your Bearable data and prevents any person from using your device without your permission.</p>\n<p>ii.\nSet up a feature that will allow you to erase all the data from your device if it\u2019s been lost or stolen.\nFor iOS, activating this feature is a two-step process: first, you need to Activate \u201cFind My iPhone\u201d via iCloud (see instructions on&nbsp;Apple Support pages) and then enable \u201cErase your device\u201d (see instructions on&nbsp;Apple Support pages).</p>\n<p>For Android, download and set up&nbsp;Find My Device&nbsp;(formerly Android Device Manager) from the Google Play Store and, if needed, use the connected&nbsp;web interface&nbsp;to lock or wipe your phone remotely.</p>\n<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i> Data transfer outside the EU and to third-party apps<p>Any personal data collected from you may only be transferred to countries outside the European Union / the European Economic Area (EEA) observing applicable privacy regulations and ensuring that your privacy rights remain protected.&nbsp.\nThis includes ensuring that all such transfers are subject to approved safeguards which meet the requirements of Data Protection Legislation (for example, through the use of EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses).&nbsp;</p>\n<strong>Google Firebase</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Bearable App we use Firebase (https://www.firebase.com/), a framework maintained by the Google subsidiary Firebase residing in San Francisco, CA, USA, through which we use to track and administer the following real-time functions:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>1.\nTracking of basic user events for Firebase</p>\n<p>2.\nUser Authentication</p>\n<p>3.\nDatabase Storage</p>\n<p>4.\nTracking of app crashes and their reasons through Firebase Crashlytics</p>\n<p>For all mentioned Firebase services, only anonymized or pseudonymized user data is transmitted to Firebase (Google).\nFirebase\u2019s privacy policy is available under https://www.firebase.com/terms/privacy-policy.html.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use Firebase Crashlytics to track app crashes as they occur, and to prevent future ones.\nIn case of an app crash, a report is created that contains the type and OS of the device, your last activities in the app, and your geolocation in pseudonymous form, and that is sent to Google.\nInformation on the functionality of Crashlytics is available under&nbsp;https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics/</li>\n<li>We use Firebase Authentication to allow you to sign up and log in \u2013 Most apps need to know the identity of a user.\nKnowing your identity allows us to securely save user data in the cloud and provide the same personalized experience across all of the your devices.</li>\n<li>Your data is safely stored on the secure Firestore database, which automatically encrypts all data before it is stored, as can be read&nbsp;here.&nbsp.\n&nbsp;The location of our Firestore is EU-West3 (Frankfurt, Germany).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Apple Health (iOS)</strong>\n<p>Bearable will not exchange any personal data with Apple\u2019s Health Kit app without your prior approval.\nApproval is given by you in the relevant settings of the Health Kit app or within the Bearable app during initial user profile setup or via app settings and can be revoked by you at any time.\nIf you have given your approval, Bearable may interact with the Health Kit app on your iOS device and read information from it, such as Steps, Sleep, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and Weight data..\nThis may include a transfer of your personal data to Apple servers located outside the European Union.</p>\n<p>You can choose if and to what extent your personal data is exchanged between Bearable and the Health Kit app by granting or revoking appropriate permissions in the Health Kit app settings.\nPlease refer to the Privacy Information of Apple Health for further information.</p>\n<strong>Google Fit</strong>\n<p>Bearable will not exchange any personal data with Google Fit without your prior approval, such approval is given by you in the relevant settings of Google Fit or within the Bearable app during initial user profile setup or via app settings and which can be revoked by you at any time.\nIf you have given your approval, Bearable may interact with Google Fit on your Android device and read information from it, such as Steps, Sleep, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and Weight data.\nThis may include a transfer of your personal data to Google servers located outside the European Union.</p>\n<p>You can choose whether or not your personal data is exchanged between Bearable and Google Fit by granting or revoking appropriate permissions in Google Fit settings.\nPlease refer to the Privacy Information of Google Fit for further information.</p>\n<strong>Facebook Login</strong>\n<p>Bearable uses Facebook Login to allow our users to create and log in to their Bearable account with their Facebook credentials.\nIf you sign up for Bearable using Facebook, you authorise us to collect your basic profile information available via Facebook such as your name and email address.&nbsp.\nThis information is collected by Facebook and is provided to us under the terms of Facebook\u2019s privacy policy.\nYou can control the data we receive from Facebook in the privacy
