protections to help protect your data from others.</p>\nTattle-tale\n<p>elementary OS helps you keep tabs on what apps are up to.\nWhen an app is using your microphone, we display an indicator to let you know.\nWhen an app is using a lot of energy, we tell you in your power indicator.</p>\nPermissions\n<p>When an app wants access to your data or devices, it has to ask up front.\nWe review all AppCenter apps to ensure they\u2019re properly using permissions\u2014and you can always revoke them yourself in System Settings.</p>\nHousekeeping\n<p>elementary OS automatically keeps your temporary and trashed files tidied up.\nNot only does this keep your device\u2019s storage free, it can help ensure your private data doesn\u2019t come back to haunt you.</p>\nOnline Accounts\n<p>elementary OS optionally integrates with online accounts such as email and calendar providers via System Settings.\nData from these providers may be retrieved by your copy of elementary OS and stored locally on your device to be displayed in locally-installed apps such as Mail, Calendar, and Tasks.\n<strong>This data is not sent to elementary or shared with any third party.</strong>\n</p>\nWhat Data is Collected\n<p>If you choose to add an online account, your copy of elementary OS may collect and store your name, email address, avatar, email messages, calendar events, contacts, photos, and files from your connected accounts locally on your device.\n<strong>elementary does not collect any of this data.</strong>\n</p>\nHow Data is Used\n<p>\n<strong>Your data is stored locally on your device
