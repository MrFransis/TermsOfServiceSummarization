PURPOSE OF INFORMATION COLLECTION <p>IdenTrust is a Certification Authority (a CA) that is recognized and relied upon by the major browser manufacturers to issue Digital Certificates (also known as PKI certificates and X.509 certificates).\nThese certificates are used by individuals to authenticate their identity to others, and/or to encrypt sensitive data including financial transactions so they can be transferred over the Internet.\nDigital Certificates are also used by computers to encrypt data exchanged between web hosts and Internet users.</p>\n<p>As a CA, when IdenTrust issues a Digital Certificate, others are assured that the certificate holder is who he or she claims to be, and that information encrypted by the certificate is safe from outside viewing or intrusion.</p>\n<p>Whenever an individual provides information about himself or herself to apply for a Digital Certificate, this information is called \u201cPersonal Information\u201d and the person is called a \u201cData Subject.\u201d</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information that IdenTrust processes from Digital Certificate applicants and holders and describes how IdenTrust collects and uses Personal Data.\nIt also describes how IdenTrust gathers, processes, and protects it.\nIt also describes your rights to obtain a copy of the Personal Information we have about you, and other rights that will be described later.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please note:</strong> In addition to issuing Digital Certificates directly to individuals under certain US government programs, IdenTrust processes certificate data for other institutions such as banks.\nIf you obtain a Digital Certificate through a bank or other organization, that organization\u2019s policies for handling

the subprocessor so that the Subject Data receives adequate protection and so that use is limited to the necessary subprocessing function.\nWe remain potentially liable if an agent that we engage to assist us does so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>\n<p>If we are merged with, or acquired by, another entity who becomes the successor to our obligations concerning the Personal Information you have provided to IdenTrust, then you consent to the continued retention and use of your personal information for such purpose by such an entity under the terms of this Privacy

disclosing certain information about the Digital Certificate holder to any person or organization that relies upon the Digital Certificate (the Relying Party).\nThis disclosure is made at the Relying Party\u2019s request using special online protocols that are part of email and browser applications.\nIdenTrust maintains lists, or repositories, of valid certificates, and only the information contained in a Digital Certificate is available in a repository for disclosure, as described in the following paragraphs.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, all information contained in a Digital Certificate, or in a revocation or suspension instruction, validation request, validation response, or certificate revocation list (collectively, \"Credential Documents\") is not considered confidential and can be

support@identrust.com.\nIf you obtained your Digital Certificate through a Registration Authority or Registration Agent such as your bank or employer, you must contact them to have the changes made.\nIdenTrust cannot change Personal Information supplied to us by these entities.\nIf you are unsure who collected your Personal Information, you can email a copy of your Digital Certificate to support@identrust.com and we will direct you to the proper entity.\nSubject to the applicable requirements of the Privacy Shield and the GDPR relating to fees, IdenTrust reserves the right to charge a fee to the inquirer in connection with the inquiry, regardless of the results of the inquiry.<br>\nRegardless of who you contact, because of the nature of Digital Certificates, in some cases updating or correcting information will require the revocation and replacement of your Digital Certificate.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your rights under GDPR:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If the GDPR applies with respect to your Personal Information, and if you obtained a Digital Certificate directly through the IdenTrust websites, we are happy to provide you with a copy of your Personal Information in our

year in which you obtained your Digital Certificate (this is critical if your Digital Certificate has expired and we are retaining your Personal Information in our archives)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, any of the following information may serve to speed up our response:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Application ID number</li>\n<li>Account number</li>\n<li>Digital Certificate serial

you must contact them to obtain a copy of your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>We can correct inaccurate data using the processes described above.\nWe can also restrict further processing of your Personal Information, in some cases by suspending your Digital Certificate.\nHowever, because of the nature of Digital Certificates, we are unable to erase Digital Certificate-related data, and we cannot transmit it to another Certificate Authority, since it is not technically feasible to do so and still enable the receiving organization to validate the integrity of the
