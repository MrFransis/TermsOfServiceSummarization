LookupDMCA PolicyPowered By GitBookPrivacy Policy<em>Effective date: October 23rd, 2020</em>Rocket.Chat Technologies Corp.\n(\"us\", \"we\", or \"our\") operates the https://rocket.chat website, the https://open.rocket.chat community server, the Marketplace, incl.\nassociated Rocket.Chat Apps, Rocket.Chat\u00b4s Cloud Offering and the Rocket.Chat mobile applications (the \"Service\").This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.We use your data to provide and improve the Service.\nBy using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.\nUnless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.Summary<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Administrators are responsible for user privacy, we help administrators</strong>There are basically two ways of using Rocket.Chat: self-managed (also known as on-premises deployment) on your own or someone else\u00b4s infrastructure or via our hosted offering.\nIn both cases, the administrator of that instance - or the organization behind the administrator - is the person responsible to ensure privacy of Rocket.Chat users.\nWe aim to help by providing features in our products and services to make that job easier.\nWe also provide this policy to explain what we do as a \"helping hand\"/data processor for administrators in case we process personal data of users.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You remain in control of your personal data</strong>We cannot access your personal data in a self-managed instance of Rocket.Chat.\nOur code is open source, there are no back doors whatsoever.\nYou are however free to connect a self-managed instance to other services, e.g.\nour marketplace or push notification gateway, where this privacy policy applies.\nWhen you do not register your instance, these settings are turned off by default.\nYou can also connect it to third party services, such as external authentication services, in which case their privacy policy applies.\nIt is your choice and you are not forced to do so.\nIn our hosted offering, we only process your data for the purposes of providing you the service in the name of the administrator.\nAdministrators are still in full control over the configuration of their instance.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>We don\u00b4t sell your data</strong>We do not sell your personal data.\nOur business model is to provide you with a free edition and we charge you for extra services or features, according to the plan you choose.\nWhat you process within Rocket.Chat is yours and stays yours.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Our community server is for testing purposes</strong>Our community server https://open.rocket.chat is a testing ground for our users and we use it to test and analyze new features.\nWe track user activity in there with the trackers described below - including google analytics - to learn how our service is used and to improve our product.</li>\n</ul>Definitions<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Service</strong>Service means the https://rocket.chat website, the https://open.rocket.chat community server, the Rocket.Chat Marketplace, incl.\nassociated Rocket.Chat Apps, the https://cloud.rocket.chat service offering, push notification gateways and the Rocket.Chat mobile applications operated by Rocket.Chat Technologies Corp.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Data</strong>Personal Data means data about a living individual who can be identified from those data (or from those and other information either in our possession or likely to come into our possession).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Usage Data</strong>Usage Data is data collected automatically either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Controller</strong>Data Controller means the natural or legal person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information are, or are to be, processed.For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we are a Data Controller of your Personal Data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Processors (or Service Providers)</strong>Data Processor (or Service Provider) means any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.We may use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Data Subject (or User)</strong>Data Subject is any living individual who is using our Service and is the subject of Personal Data.</li>\n</ul>Information Collection and UseWe collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.Types of Data CollectedPersonal DataWhile using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you (\"Personal Data\").\nPersonally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:<ul>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>First name and last name</li>\n<li>Cookies and Usage Data</li>\n</ul>We may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you, if you have provided consent to this processing or if we can base this processing on a legitimate interest that is not overridden by your fundamental rights.\nYou may in the future withdraw that consent or object to receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send or by contacting us.Account DataSome Services may allow or require that you register for a personalized account.\nAccount data may include in addition your account name, authentication information, registration date, contact information, payment information and any other information associated with your account.Usage DataWe may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service or when you access the Service, incl.\nby or through a mobile device (\"Usage Data\").This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g.\nIP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, this Usage Data may include information such as the type of mobile device you use, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the app version, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.As a byproduct of the usage data within a Rocket.Chat instance, Administrators may chose to share aggregated and therefore anonymous, non-personal data with us to help us learn more about how our product is being used.\nThis setting is described here.\nThe information shared is the same information as is shown on the \"info\"-page of the administration panel of an instance.\nE.g.\nthis statistics sharing would transmit the total # of channels, but it would not transmit the actual channel names, and so on, preserving privacy of your workspace.\nThis is completely optional to use and can be activated and deactivated any time.Location DataWe may use and store information about your location if you give us permission to do so (\u201cLocation Data\u201d).\nWe use this data to provide features of our Service (only to allow you to share your location to another user via Rocket.Chat, if it was enabled by the administrator).You can enable or disable location services when you use our Service at any time, through your device settings.App DataWhen you use the Marketplace, you may choose to install Apps provided by Rocket.Chat.\nThese Apps process data from your instance of Rocket.Chat and therefore nonpersonal data, such as software version, amount of users, and similar.\nDepending on the purpose and your actual usage of the App (e.g.\nenabling certain features), Personal Data may however be processed.\nE.g.\nyou enable an integration, which processes your users\u00b4information.\nThe description of the App will make the types of personal data sufficiently clear as well as any potential deviations from this policy.For Third Party Apps on the Marketplace, the Vendor will provide you with a specific privacy policy that governs his Third Party App.Content you provideWhen you use our Services you may provide content into that service (e.g.\nupload file, send a message).Tracking &amp.\nCookies DataWe use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information.\nWe DO NOT track activity in your self-managed instances.\nWe regularly do monitor aggregated activity data on our infrastructure, but it is not tracking of individual users in the sense of this paragraph, which only occurs when we have a legitimate interest to do so (e.g.\nfor security and compliance purposes).\nWe do perform regular tracking on our community server.Cookies are files with small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier.\nCookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device.\nTracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nHowever, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.Examples of Cookies we use:<ul>\n<li>Session Cookies.\nWe use Session Cookies to operate our Service.</li>\n<li>Preference Cookies.\nWe use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings.</li>\n<li>Security Cookies.\nWe use Security Cookies for security purposes.</li>\n</ul>Distinction of data collection between Self Managed Workspaces and Hosted WorkspacesThe following paragraph applies to data processing in Rocket.Chat workspaces and is for clarification purposes only.\nSelf Managed workspaces and workspaces hosted by us differ in the kind of data we are processing from you, because in case of our hosted offering, all data put into the workspaces is technically processed on our infrastructure.There is also a difference between <strong>registered</strong>, self managed workspaces (which consume services from us) and <strong>unregistered</strong>, self managed workspaces.See the following table for a general distinction between the data that is processed in each case.\nKeep in mind that this can differ in individual circumstances, such as cases where apps are installed on unregistered workspaces via workarounds.Data

system.\nWe may throttle your use of the APIs in case we deem it necessary to facilitate an overall acceptable service level across our infrastructure (e.g.\nsuch as in the case of continued, excessive API usage).\nWe may monitor use of the APIs for compliance with these rules, and we may deny you access to the API or shut down your Integration if you try to go around or break the policies we set.\nIf your Order Form includes a defined API limit or minimum, then the Order Form controls.<strong>Supported and running versions</strong>To provide you the Services in a consistent and secure manner, we regularly update our Services and only support the Rocket.Chat versions, that are within their support period as stated in our support policy.\nSpecifically for our Cloud Hosting, we automatically upgrade Rocket.Chat servers to stay within the supported version range and do not provide versions, that are beyond their End of Life term.<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>If we believe that there is a violation of the Customer Terms or any of our other policies that can simply be remedied by removal of certain Customer Data or taking other action, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action (including disabling your account) if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Users, or any third parties, including Vendors and Third Party Apps.\nTo the maximum extent permitted by law, Rocket.Chat offers the Services and Products \u201cAS IS\u201d and \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d, and Rocket.Chat hereby disclaims all

expressly provided otherwise, the Initial Subscription Period is 12 months from the initial order, activation, subscription, or use date and automatically renews for successive 12 month periods

any time upon 30 days' written notice to Rocket.Chat, provided that You have paid all fees up to and including the last day of the then current applicable Subscription Period(s) in effect prior to termination and regardless of the date of your notice of termination or use of the Services.\nYour pricing is based on the Subscription Period, and early termination does not relieve you of your obligations to pay for the full Subscription Period even if you terminate or do not use the Services for the entire Subscription Period, unless expressly agreed otherwise.<strong>b.\nFor Cause</strong>.\nEither party may terminate these Customer Terms or any Subscription Period immediately upon 30 days\u2019 written notice to the other party in the event of any material breach of this

not cured during such notice period.\nEither party may also terminate these Customer Terms and all Subscription Periods, without notice, (i) upon the institution by or against the other party of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings (provided such proceedings are not dismissed within one hundred twenty (120) days of such institution), (ii) upon the other party's making an

You are entitled to a full refund of pre-paid fees if you terminate your Initial Subscription Period within 30 days of the start of such Subscription Period.\nYou are also entitled to a refund in the event that You terminate pursuant to a material uncured breach by Rocket.Chat.\nIn the foregoing cases, Rocket.Chat will refund You a pro-rated portion of pre-paid Fees for Services not actually made

and non-cancellable.<strong>Effect of Termination or Expiration</strong>.\nUnless You are entitled for a refund as described above, Termination or expiration shall not relieve You of the obligation to pay any fees or other amounts accrued or payable to Rocket.Chat including fees for the remainder of the Subscription Period(s) after an earlier termination.\nIf Rocket.Chat terminates for cause, Customer will immediately pay all amounts due and payable for the remainder of the Subscription Period(s) without limiting Rocket.Chat\u2019s other rights and remedies.\nWithout prejudice to any other

forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective on the date we publish the change.\nIf you use the Services after the effective date of any changes, that use will constitute your

waiver under the Customer Terms will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party being deemed to have granted the waiver.<strong>Severability</strong>The Customer Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.\nIf any provision of the Customer Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the Customer Terms will remain in effect.<strong>Assignment</strong>You may not assign any of your rights or delegate your obligations under these Customer Terms,

an online marketplace for plugins, addons and extensions (\"Apps\") that work with Rocket.Chat\u00b4s products.\nThe following sections govern specific provisions regarding the Marketplace in the context of these Customer Terms.<strong>\n<em>App Listing</em>\n</strong> The listing for each App will identify the provider of the App (\u201cVendor\u201d), which may be Rocket.Chat or a third party.\nApps for which Rocket.Chat is the Vendor are \"Rocket.Chat Apps,\u201d and Apps for which the Vendor is a third party are \u201cThird Party Apps\u201d.<strong>\n<em>Orders</em>\n</strong> You

that Rocket.Chat is the Vendor\u2019s commercial agent and that you are required to make any related payments directly to Rocket.Chat, except where Third Party Apps may be enabled or paid for through a third party Vendor\u2019s own website and this is indicated in the App listing.\nOnce you complete your Order, Rocket.Chat will provide you with access to the applicable Apps.\nApps are provided on a license or subscription basis and you do not acquire any ownership rights in the Marketplace or the Apps.\nYou may terminate your Order of an App under these Terms, for no reason or any reason, by providing notice of termination to us no later than fourteen (14) days after the Order date for such App.\nIn the event you terminate your initial Order, we will refund you the amount paid under the

third party\u2019s Vendor Terms, not Rocket.Chat Terms.\nBy ordering, installing or enabling any Third Party App, you are entering into the Vendor Terms directly with the applicable third party Vendor.\nAny support and maintenance of Third Party Apps will be provided by the applicable Vendor to the extent described in the applicable Vendor Terms.<strong>\n<em>Access to Data</em>\n</strong>
