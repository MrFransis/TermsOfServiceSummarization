Information?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we consider&nbsp;<strong>personal information</strong>&nbsp;to be any information that describes you as an identifiable individual, other than your business title or business contact information when used or disclosed for the purpose of business communications.</p>\n<p>For example, personal information includes your name, age, e-mail address, preferences (such as asking to receive our emails or special offers), viewing habits (including how and when you use the Service) and, where applicable, payment details.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>What Personal Information Do We Collect?&nbsp;</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can visit the Service without directly telling us who you are.\nHowever,&nbsp;it is important to note&nbsp;that our web server collects information related to your visit to the Service, including the IP address and domain used to access the Service, your geographic location, an identifier that is unique to the device on which you install an App and some identifiers that may be persistent identifiers, the type and version of your browser, the website you came from to access the Service, the page you entered and exited at, any pages that are viewed by that IP address and the country from which you accessed the Service.</p>\n<p>We use this information to monitor the performance of the Service (such as number of visits, average time spent per page, number of page views), to determine interest in the Service, and for business purposes, such as working to continually upgrade the Service to meet consumer needs.</p>\n<p>In addition, we may collect the personal information that you submit to us, such as your name, address, email and any other contact or other information that you choose to provide by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>registering as a member/subscriber on the Service;</li>\n<li>using your membership or subscriber account to access the Service;</li>\n<li>contributing an article, photo, video, comment, data, or preferences to the Service;</li>\n<li>sharing the contact information of others;</li>\n<li>corresponding with us via e-mail using the hyperlinks created for that purpose;</li>\n<li>corresponding with us via our customer relations management system.\nor</li>\n<li>through other communication methods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We do not collect personal information like name, address or contact information from your children.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your personal information may also be collected when you participate in surveys or polls, or respond to special offers, give-aways or promotions on the Service.\nIn addition, the Service may store your electronic chat and other communications, which are necessarily incidental to the transmission and delivery of those communications and to prevent misuse of the Service.</p>\n<p>Other, more fulsome information, such as your account status, payment details, choice of services and preferences, and viewing of titles is created and maintained in the normal course of providing services to our members/subscribers and other users.\nThis includes the tracking of titles viewed, time spent watching titles within the Service, and use of parental control features.</p>\n<p>This information is collected and aggregated with the information of other users in order to gain an understanding of the viewing habits and preferences of our members/subscribers and to assist us with the selection and adjustment of future content and features for the Service.&nbsp;<strong>It is also collected to permit parents of children under eighteen (18) years of age to monitor their children\u2019s usage of the Service through the Parents Room.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Service does not allow interest-based advertising or remarketing.\nAdditionally, the Service does not allow your children to share personal information with third parties or make it publicly available.&nbsp;In any instance that we collect personal information from a child, we will retain that information only so long as reasonably necessary to provide the Service, and ensure the security of our users and our services, or as required by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Why Do We Collect, Use and Disclose Personal Information?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect for internal operational purposes such as for spam and abuse prevention and enforcing our content license restrictions, determining preferred language and providing and improving the service.</p>\n<p>We also use this information to offer users personalized content.\nWe associate a mobile identifier that\u2019s unique to the app with the videos your children have watched and terms they\u2019ve searched for to recommend videos likely to be of interest to them, subject to the controls described below.\nWe use mobile identifiers to provide contextual advertising, including ad frequency capping.\nSee \u201c<em>What Are Persistent Device Identifiers?</em>\u201c, below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your personal information may be shared with our employees, contractors, consultants and affiliates who require such information to assist us with establishing, maintaining and managing our relationship with you or developing, operating and maintaining the Service.&nbsp.\nThese individuals or entities must keep your information confidential and secure.</p>\n<p>We will not share your personal information with any third-party except in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With consent:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We will share individual user information with companies, organizations or individuals when we have parental consent.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For legal reasons:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We will share individual user information with companies, organizations or individuals if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:<ul>\n<li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li>\n<li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations;</li>\n<li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;</li>\n<li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>If we undergo a business transaction:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If we become involved in a merger, consolidation, acquisition, sale of assets, joint venture, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction, we may share or transfer your information to a third party or parties in connection therewith.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For external processing:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We may provide individual user information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Except in the limited circumstances listed above, APMC does not share your personal information with any third parties.\nWe may share aggregate information about the use of the app with third parties to, for example, show trends about the use of the app or meet our reporting obligations with partners.\nAny aggregate data that we share with third parties is anonymized and does not contain any information about identifiable individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>We May Send You E-mail</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time we may e-mail important information to you regarding the Service (such as a change to our service offering).</p>\n<p>In addition, when you request information from us or become a member/subscriber of the Service, we may use the e-mail address that you provide to send you information about offers on products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp.\nIf you do not wish to receive such e-mails, you may opt out of receiving emails by simply clicking on the unsubscribe link within the email sent by us.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>A Few Words About Online Safety</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that while we take steps to protect your personal information and the integrity of the Service, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.&nbsp.\nIn addition, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on message boards, in e-mails, or in chat or comment areas on the Service, that information can be collected and used by others.\nIf you post personal information in public places, others may send you unsolicited e-mail messages or attempt to contact you in other ways.</p>\n<p>Always be cautious about the information you provide or store online.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>How Is Your Personal Information Protected?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>APMC will endeavor to maintain physical, technical and procedural safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information in question.\nThese safeguards are designed to prevent your personal information from loss and unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or destruction.</p>\n<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.\nPlease advise us immediately by email at privacy@kidoodle.tv of any incident involving the loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information that is in our custody or control.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp.\nAs a result, while the Service strives to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality or security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Special Notes About Children Users</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We do not knowingly collect, use, disclose or store any personal information from children unless we have obtained prior verifiable parental consent.&nbsp.\nCurrently, the registration features on the Service are intended strictly for parental/guardian use and we take several measures to make this apparent to our users and prevent children from submitting personal information to our Service.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We also ask parent(s)/guardian(s) to carefully monitor the usage of the Service as part of a joint commitment to work with APMC to provide a safe viewing experience for children.&nbsp.\nIf you wish to further understand how your child may use the Service, you may visit the Parents Room associated with your account, which provides access to information regarding the titles that your account has accessed through the Service, time spent using the Service, and other parent account information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered personally identifiable information directly from a child we will attempt to notify such child\u2019s parent or guardian and remove such information from our records.&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you believe that we might have collected personal information from your child without your consent, please contact us at privacy@kidoodle.tv.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>How Do We Use Cookies and Local Shared Objects?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit the Service, we may place a \u201ccookie\u201d on the hard drive of your computer to track your visit.&nbsp.\nA cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your hard drive through your web browser that can only be read by the website that placed the cookie on your hard drive.&nbsp.\nThe cookie acts as an identification card and allows the Service to identify you and to record your passwords and preferences.&nbsp.\nThe cookie allows us to track your visit to the Service so that we can better understand your use of the Service and customize and tailor it to better meet your needs.&nbsp.\nFor example, our cookies help us to learn about the usage of the Service by tracking how many visitors we have, how often they visit various sections of the Service, and their geographic location.</p>\n<p>Persistent cookies remain on the visitor\u2019s computer after the browser has been closed.\nSession cookies exist only during a visitor\u2019s online session and disappear from the visitor\u2019s computer when they close the browser software.</p>\n<p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies.&nbsp.\nHowever, on most web browsers you may change this setting to have your web browser either: (1) notify you prior to a website placing a cookie on your hard drive so that you can decide whether or not to accept the cookie.\nor (2) automatically prevent the placing of a cookie on your hard drive.&nbsp.\nIt should be noted that if cookies are not accepted, you will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be able to access a number of web pages found on the website.</p>\n<p>We also may use local shared objects, which are commonly referred to as \u201cflash cookies.\u201d As with browser cookies, opting out of local shared objects may interfere with the proper functioning of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>How Do We Use Web Beacons?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>APMC uses web beacons, which are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data.\nYou can disable the ability of web beacons to capture information by blocking cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>What Are Persistent Device Identifiers?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Persistent device identifiers are unique strings that are associated with the mobile device that you use to connect to the Service.\nAPMC uses persistent device identifiers to identify and track your mobile device usage of the Service.\nPersistent device identifiers may be modified or disabled by sophisticated users.\nDisabling persistent device identifiers may interfere with the proper functioning of the Service.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Your Rights</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your personal information is always yours.\nSubject to any legal or regulatory requirements that may restrict us from providing access to any information we have collected, you have the right to access personal information, have it corrected, or have it deleted, and to let us know if you have any concerns about how we protect it.\nTo exercise your right to access your personal information, or to correct or delete it, please contact us at privacy@kidoodle.tv.</p>\n<p>When requesting access to your personal information, please note that we may request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide you with the personal information that we hold about you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Inquiries or Concerns?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy policies, please send an e-mail with your questions or comments to

intellectual property of others from misuse, we ask you to help us.</p>\n<p>If you notice or suspect any copyright infringement, please notify us by mail or email as follows:</p>\n<p>Copyright Officer<br>c/o A Parent Media Co.\nInc.<br>Suite 320, 333 \u2013 24th Avenue SW,<br>Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2S 3E6<br>privacy@kidoodle.tv</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Claims under US Copyright Law</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\u201cDMCA\u201d) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S.\ncopyright law.\nIf you believe, in good faith, that materials hosted on the Site infringe your copyright, please provide APMC at the address above with a notice of infringement (\u201cNotice\u201d) containing the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>an electronic or physical signature of the owner of the copyright or of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest;</li>\n<li>a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed including the URL (i.e.\nInternet address) or other specific location on the Site where the material that you claim is infringing is located, including enough information to allow us to locate the material and to determine why you believe an infringement has taken place;</li>\n<li>a description of the location where the original or an authorized copy of the copyrighted work exists, for example the URL where it is posted;</li>\n<li>your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;</li>\n<li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\nand</li>\n<li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your Notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner\u2019s behalf.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you believe that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send APMC a counter-notice.\nNotices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed under the DMCA.\nWe suggest that you consult a legal advisor before filing a Notice or counter-notice.\nAlso be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.\nAPMC may suspend or terminate membership privileges, Accounts and access to the Site and Services for those who engage in repeated acts of infringement.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Claims under Canadian Copyright Law</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Effective January 2, 2015, new rules under the amended Canadian Copyright Act also give copyright owners the right to send notifications to digital network providers, including organizations such as APMC, alleging that a customer has infringed their Canadian copyright.\nThis system is known as \u201cNotice-and-Notice\u201d.\nNotices sent under it must contain certain information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the infringement alleged;</li>\n<li>to which material the allegation relates;</li>\n<li>the claimant\u2019s right in the material, and name and address.\nand</li>\n<li>the electronic address, date, and time of the alleged activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Such a notice should be sent to APMC at the address above.</p>\n<p>Under Notice-and-Notice, digital network providers, including organizations such as APMC receiving a notice of claimed infringement are required to do two things.\nWe must forward the notice of claimed infringement to the customer/Subscriber whose account corresponds to the electronic location and time identified in the notice.\nSecondly, we must preserve, for six months, the records allowing the identity of the person to whom the electronic location belongs to be determined.\nIf a court orders us to, we may be required to preserve those records for longer.</p>\n<p>Rightsholders are entitled to take legal action to enforce their rights under the Canadian Copyright Act.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Claims under other Copyright Law</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>Other laws in other countries may provide different remedies for cases of alleged copyright infringement.&nbsp.\nAPMC abides, and requires its customers, to abide by all applicable laws.\nAPMC therefore encourages everyone to become familiar with their rights and obligations under the law.\nThese include both copyright obligations, and privacy rights.</p>\n<p>Copyright owners who believe that copyrights other than in Canada on the United States may be infringed may send notifications to APMC, alleging that a customer has infringed their copyright and should specify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the infringement alleged;</li>\n<li>to which material the allegation relates;</li>\n<li>the claimant\u2019s right in the material, and name and address.\nand</li>\n<li>the electronic address, date, and time of the alleged activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any other relevant information should also be included in the notice.&nbsp;Such a notice should be sent to APMC at the address above.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<u>Disclosure of Customer Information</u>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>APMC may be asked, under the applicable law, to provide customer information when there is evidence of potential copyright infringement, and the copyright owner decides to take action.\nAPMC will only disclose customer information in these circumstances if required to do so by a court order or other legal or regulatory process.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>SITE, SERVICES AND MATERIALS PROVIDED \u201cAS
