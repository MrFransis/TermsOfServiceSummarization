may collect your IP address or other Device Identifier, which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the third party feature to function properly.\nThird party features and applications are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy(ies) of the company(ies) providing it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy.\nThe information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service.\nThe third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected in compliance with all applicable laws.</p>\n<strong>Information We Collect Automatically&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>Like other web sites and online services, we and our analytics providers, vendors and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain \"Usage Information\" whenever you access and use the Services.&nbsp.\nFor example, we may collect information regarding when a user downloads resources such as pdfs or the pages a user accesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information.\nWe may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to select appropriate content to display to you and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.</p>\n<p>In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a \"Device\") you may use to access the Services.\nA Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.\nSome mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service, internet service provider (ISP), date and time of your visit, browser language, browser type, referring and exit pages and URLs, amount of time spent on particular pages, which parts of our Services you use, which links you click, search terms, operating system, traffic and related statistics, keywords, and/or other general browsing or usage data.\nUsage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p>\n<p>Usage

to websites and online service you visit.\nDNT is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services.\nHowever, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the internet industry is still working to determine what DNT means, how to comply with DNT, and how to create a common approach to responding to DNT.\nTo find out more about \"Do Not Track\", please visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.&nbsp;</p>

Policy and applicable law with regard to such Personal Information.\nIn the event that CommonLit goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process, your information, including Personal Information, will

mobile applications, you agree that CommonLit may store and use that information for security purposes (for example, for user verification or authentication and to ensure that our APIs are being used appropriately).</p>\n8.\nHow does CommonLit protect children\u2019s information?\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important to CommonLit.\nFor that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect Personal Information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age, or higher age if required by applicable law (\u201cChild Users\u201d).</p>\n<p>CommonLit does not knowingly permit Child Users to use our Services without prior, express consent from a parent or legal guardian, except through agreements with schools or districts or as otherwise permitted under the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).\nIf we learn that Personal Information of a Child User has been collected on our Services without prior parental consent, then we will take appropriate steps to delete this information.\nIf you are a parent or guardian (\u201cParent\u201d) and discover that your child under the age of 13 (or a higher age if required by applicable law) has a registered account with our Services without your consent, please contact your child\u2019s school and alert CommonLit at security@commonlit.org and request that we delete that child\u2019s personal information from our systems.</p>\n<strong>How does a child register and use the services?</strong>\n<p>Child Users cannot obtain a User Account without first receiving a prompt from their school.\nCommonLit obligates schools and teachers (or other authorized individuals) to first obtain any necessary parental consents before permitting children to register for a User Account or use the Services.</p>\n<strong>What children\u2019s information is visible to others?</strong>\n<p>No student\u2019s profile is made available or visible to the public through CommonLit.\nIf a teacher utilizes certain features on a device in the classroom, other students may be able to view information that is displayed by the teacher in the classroom, but students can\u2019t view each other\u2019s individual student profiles.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Parents:</strong>&nbsp;To review your child\u2019s User data you must request the information from your child\u2019s teacher.&nbsp;</p>\n9.\nHow does CommonLit protect and store my information?\n<p>CommonLit takes data security very seriously.&nbsp.\nCommonLit takes commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures designed to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.&nbsp.\nSuch measures vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue.&nbsp.\nMeasures taken to protect your data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We continually test CommonLit\u2019s security practices for vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>We periodically review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems</li>\n<li>We continually develop and implement features to keep your personal information safe - for example, all traffic to and from our application is over secure, encrypted protocols (SSL/TLS).</li>\n<li>We ensure passwords are stored securely using encryption and salted one-way hashing</li>\n<li>We also operate a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 security program to encourage an active community of third party security researchers to report any security bugs to us.\nMore information on this is available by contacting us at security@commonlit.org.</li>\n<li>Every CommonLit employee participates in training on the importance of and methods for protecting Personal Information.\nTraining consists of how to remain compliant with federal and state regulations (e.g .\nFERPA, COPPA, and SOPIPA), CommonLit policies, and general security posturing to protect student data (including techniques such as Two Factor Authentication, Drive Encryption, creating and managing strong passwords, etc).\n&nbsp;</li>\n<li>All CommonLit employees are trained in security practices and procedures designed to keep Your Data under strict internal controls.</li>\n<li>Developers peer-review code to make sure changes adhere to best practices for security.</li>\n<li>Administrators are knowledgeable of security practices and harden the infrastructure with necessary patches, monitor security resources for advisories and vulnerabilities, and scan the environment and application to ensure that student information remains secure.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How will CommonLit handle a data breach or security incident?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that CommonLit becomes aware of a data breach impacting your Personal Information, we will provide notification in compliance with all applicable laws.\nFor example, we may post a notice on our homepage (www.CommonLit.org) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us.\nDepending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CommonLit has procedures in place that are designed to stop threats that may expose personally identifiable information, restore Services to full functionality, and document and take proactive steps to ensure the incident cannot be repeated.\nCommonLit will also preserve necessary evidence for investigation by security professionals and law enforcement as appropriate.\nIn the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of records, CommonLit will follow its internal procedures, which articulates how to report the problem to internal and external stakeholders.\nThe notification process includes any information that can identify which customers and students may have been impacted, the data that may have been accessed, CommonLit\u2019s process to inform affected customers, and steps to prevent the incident from happening again as appropriate.</p>\n<p>In the unlikely event of an unauthorized disclosure of Data, CommonLit has implemented a process for responding to incidents and notifying affected individuals and, if applicable, law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can email us by clicking&nbsp;here.</p>\n10.\nHow can I
