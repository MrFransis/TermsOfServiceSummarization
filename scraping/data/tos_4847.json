our Privacy Statement may be found at https://github.com/filestack/filestack-privacy-policy.</p> Definitions <p>We collect personal data for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to operate our website;</li>\n<li>to improve our website and product offerings;</li>\n<li>to market our services;</li>\n<li>to manage our relationship with our customers and provide customer support;</li>\n<li>to manage our vendors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We allow third party advertisers, such as Google and Facebook to collect personal data on our site for the purpose of selling targeted advertisement services.\nSee Advertising Ecosystem below.</p>\n<p>We have included details of how we use data we collect for these purposes in the section below captioned Data Use.</p> Data Collection Methods Automated data

the advertising service will identify the link, enabling us to associate you with the advertising parameters we provided to the advertising service.\nFor example, we may ask an advertising service to target our ad to individuals that the ad service has identified as having a high interest in file upload management.\nIf you arrive at our site by means of the link in that ad, we will be able to identify you as having a high interest in file upload management.\nAdvertising services are responsible for the collection, use and disclosure of the data they provide to us in accordance with their published privacy policies.</p>\n<p>See the section below captioned Advertising Ecosystem and How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection.</p> Data provided by you as part of your communications with us

resellers the same as the personal information we collect directly.</p> Combinations of data collected using different methods <p>We use service providers such as Google Analytics, Segment, and

services aggregate data about an individual\u2019s behavior on many different sites and online services, and use that data to sell targeted advertising services.\nFor example, we permit Google\u2019s advertising services to collect data about your behavior on the Filestack site, as do many other website operators who use Google\u2019s ad services.\nGoogle combines the data about an individual that it collects from different sources, and uses this aggregate data to sell advertising services that target the display of ads to web users who meet certain behavioral criteria.\nGoogle does not disclose this aggregate data to Filestack, but we are able to infer that visitors who interact with our ad meet the advertising criteria we provided.\nGoogle collects this data using cookies, web server logs (its own and its advertising customers), clear gifs and other online data collection techniques.\nSee Online Data Collection Techniques and How to Opt Out of Online Data Collection.</p> Online Data Collection Techniques <p>A cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that is placed by a web server on the web visitor\u2019s browser.\nCookies are used to analyse visitors\u2019 use of the website.\nFor example, a website operator can use the cookie to identify the number of unique visitors to the site, whether or not those visitors are repeat visitors, information about the visitor\u2019s activity on the site, and the user\u2019s device and device settings.\nA tracking pixel, also known as a web bug or web beacon, is a small graphic (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) invisible to the eye, that is embedded in web content or email.\nWhen content that has an embedded web beacon is viewed, the browser will request content from a web server, which in turn will set a cookie.</p> How To Opt Out Of Online Data Collection <p>You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings.\nThe \u2018Help\u2019 feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, how to disable cookies, and when cookies will expire.\nIf you disable all cookies on your browser, neither we nor third parties will transfer cookies to your browser.\nIf you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some features and services may not work.</p>\n<p>We will recognize and respond to any \u201cdo not track\u201d setting you may have in your browser.\nThe third parties who we permit to collect data on our site have features that allow
