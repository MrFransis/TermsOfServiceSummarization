Parties</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>While we strive to work with reputable companies with good privacy practices, this Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may be displayed to you on the Services.\nWe also do not control the privacy policies and your privacy settings on third-party sites, including social networks.\nWe may use third parties to help offer you more tailored ads and better Services, such as obtaining analytics about the users of our site and to help tailor advertising to your preferences.\nFor further

process may qualify for multiple legal bases for processing under Article 6 of the General Data Protection Regulation (and similar laws that specify legal bases for processing).\nBelow are our primary legal bases for each type of data for users covered under such laws:</p>\n<br>\n<p>We obtain consent for the processing of data necessary for chatrooms, forums, and private messages, including login and account information, usernames, passwords, and the content of posts themselves.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in conducting analytics, measuring usage and conversions, detecting fraudulent users, implementing data security measures, and analyzing game telemetrics to improve our services.\nWe and our processors have measures in place to protect your privacy.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in storing users\u2019 purchase history for the purpose of providing users help in fixing purchase and payment issues.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in enabling third party ads and data collection on our sites and apps to help provide a more customized ad experience for our users and site visitors.\nOur reputable partners provide opt outs and other measures to protect your privacy.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We have a legitimate interest in sending periodic email and direct marketing to inform registered users of updates and offers.\nWe make clear disclosures when users sign up and offer opt outs for anyone not interested.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We may conduct puzzles and contests where it is contractually necessary to process your inputted data and contact information.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>It is contractually necessary to process your username, email, password, cookie data, IP address, financial information, in-game bios, names, and descriptions, and similar information to fulfill our obligations in the terms of service to provide you with high quality games with paid upgrades.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Choices</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>If you wish to cancel your account, you can do so by accessing our platform or contacting us for assistance with the process.\nOur email is included at the end of the privacy policy.</p>\n<br>\n<p>Like many other companies, we do not honor DNT flags but instead offer other choices with respect to third parties.\nMany third parties participate in self-regulation to offer you a choice regarding receiving targeted ads.\nPlease note that you\u2019ll still see generic ads after opting out, but they won\u2019t be based on your activities online.\nOn the web, you can opt out of participating companies by visiting the following sites:</p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li>http://youronlinechoices.eu<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>http://optout.networkadvertising.org<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n<li>http://optout.aboutads.info<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p>If you wish to similarly opt out of cross-app advertising on mobile devices, you can enable the Limit Ad Tracking flag on the device.\nEnabling Limit Ad Tracking sends a flag to third parties that you wish to opt out of targeted advertising on that device, and major mobile platforms require companies to honor this flag.\nScreenshots on how to find these options on various devices are available here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choices.</p>\n<br>\n<p>We aim to provide all users with the opportunity to access, update, and delete their data.\nUsers covered under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (or similar laws) have the right to access their data, rectify mistakes, erase their data, restrict certain processing (i.e., opt out), move their data, withdraw consent, and lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.\nIn some cases, we may have to keep information for legitimate business or legal purposes or may be restricted for other reasons.\nBefore updating your information, we may ask you to verify your identity and your country to determine your legal rights.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Data Security</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>We work hard to protect our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold and undertake reasonable security measures with appropriate confidentiality, integrity, and availability protections.\nHowever, since no software or storage system is 100% secure, we cannot guarantee for the security of your information associated with the Services, or any other service for that matter.\nYou can help protect your account information by using unique and hard-to-guess passwords.\nWe store data if we have a valid business reason for keeping such data and only for reasonable time periods.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>Our Services are not directed toward children under 13 and we will not knowingly collect information for any child under the legal age to provide consent to data processing (13 in the US and up to 16 in the EU).\nIf you are the parent of a child under the age required to provide consent and have a concern regarding your child\u2019s information on our Services, please contact us at&nbsp;privacy@stormlightworkshop.com.</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<strong>Updates</strong>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy may
