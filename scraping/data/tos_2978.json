privacy.\nWe are responsible for the protection of your personal data and we take this responsibility very seriously.\nAll basic customer data in CTemplar.com are encrypted end-to-end.\nThis Privacy Policy covers CTemplar.com\u2019s (\u201cCTemplar\u201d, \u201cWe\u201d, \u201cUs\u201d, \u201cOur\u201d) treatment of information we collect when you are on our site and when you use our services.\nCTemplar has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what information we collect and how we use it.</p>\n<p>This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for CTemplar and our website www.ctemplar.com (\u201cSite\u201d).\nThis privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website, except where stated otherwise.\nIt will notify you of the following:</p>\n<strong>What Information We Collect</strong>\n<p>When you visit our website, your browser sends us your user-agent and IP address.\nWhen you leave our site no records are kept of your IP address in association to your account.\nWe anonymously store your IP for 7 days.\nThis is required to defend and prevent abuse that could shut down our service.\nAfter 7 days it is deleted and no records are kept.\nIf you visit using our Onion site, then your real IP address is not seen.</p>\n<p>We do not use any CDN service.</p>\n<strong>What Information We Retain</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Username, recovery email, account preferences are not encrypted at rest and are recorded until the account is deleted.</li>\n<li>Generated PGP key pair, encrypted at rest with your password.</li>\n<li>Your password is created using a&nbsp;zero-knowledge proof, so it does not leave your computer nor is sent by the network.\nWe do not know your password.\nWe are not capable of accessing your account with the password hash we possess.</li>\n<li>Messages, Subjects and attachments between CTemplar users and external providers are encrypted at rest using your 4096-bit PGP public key.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Messages, subjects, and attachments between CTemplar users (custom domains) are encrypted end-to-end using the recipient\u2019s 4096-bit PGP public key.\nThis is done in the sender\u2019s web browser or phone app before it is sent to our servers.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Contact list is encrypted at rest using your 4096-bit PGP public key.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Metadata is encrypted at rest using your 4096-bit PGP public key (Work in progress).</li>\n<li>Users may be given an option to scan attachments for viruses.\nIf this option is selected the attachment will be sent to many, 3rd party, malware detection tools.\nIf users do not use this feature then this will not apply whatsoever.\nUsers are given an option to disable this feature.</li>\n<li>If you choose to delete your account, everything is deleted and no records or backups kept.\nHowever, we record usernames 1 year so they cannot be used during this time.\nNo other information from the deleted account is recorded except for the username.\nThis is required to prevent a new user from creating an email address that may have been previously involved in crime or court order.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Registration</strong>\n<p>In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form.\nDuring registration, a user is required to give to provide a username and password.\nThis information is used to enable your use of the Site.\nThe password is created in your browser using a&nbsp;zero-knowledge proof.\nWe do not

practices of such other sites.\nWe encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read that site\u2019s privacy statements.</p>\n<strong>Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities</strong>\n<p>CTemplar will only comply with valid Icelandic court orders.\nWhen presented with a valid Icelandic court order, we will give them your content.\nDue to our zero access password technology, we do not know your password/passphrase so we are not able to decrypt your emails.\nThe SRI &amp.\nChecksum technology that we offer makes it impossible for us to serve malicious scripts that could reveal your password, thus allowing us to access your account.</p>\n<strong>Aggregated Information</strong>\n<p>We do not collect aggregated usage or tracking information.</p>\n<strong>Updating Information</strong>\n<p>Registered users have the option of accessing, correcting, updating their settings at any time.</p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n<p>A
