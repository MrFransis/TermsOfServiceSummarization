information security.</li>\n<li>As part of a major project to evolve and future-proof our infrastructure, in August 2015 we began a major new partnership with Microsoft.\nIn addition to being able to offer a greater range of support for the latest mobile devices, our two flagship learning platforms \u2013 Mathletics and Spellodrome \u2013 were transitioned fully to Microsoft\u2019s industry-leading Azure cloud platform.\nThis marked a new era of data capacity, storage and security for our data.\nThe Microsoft Azure platform delivers an enterprise-level cloud.\nMicrosoft\u2019s industry-leading approaches to data security were central to our decision to relocate our key platforms within the environment.\nAll data is stored securely within an isolated network and database infrastructure.\nIt is not accessible to any other person or account within the public cloud.\nAccess is strictly limited to only specific elements of the 3P Learning resources.</li>\n<li>Further
