customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our Customer Care Center at (800) 773-0888.\n<strong>In the unlikely event that the LegalZoom Customer Care Center is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if LegalZoom has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction.</strong> Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts.<strong> Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong> While in some instances, upfront costs to file an arbitration claim may exceed similar costs to bring a case in court, for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, LegalZoom will pay all costs of the arbitration.\nMoreover, in arbitration you may recover attorney's fees from LegalZoom to the same extent or more as you would in court.\nThe arbitrator shall apply the same limitations period that would apply in court.\n</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances (as explained below), LegalZoom will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorney's fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than what LegalZoom offered you to settle the dispute.\n</p>\n<p>You may speak with independent counsel before using this Site or completing any purchase.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Agreement: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) LegalZoom and you agree to arbitrate <strong>all disputes and claims</strong> between us before a single arbitrator.\nThe types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt applies, without limitation, to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;</li>\n<li>claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>\n<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand</li>\n<li>claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to \"LegalZoom,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, employers,&nbsp;business partners, shareholders, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us.\nBeneficiaries include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.\n<strong>You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and LegalZoom are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong> These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S.\ncertified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") to the other party.\nA Notice to LegalZoom should be addressed to: Notice of Dispute, General Counsel, LegalZoom.com, Inc., 101 North Brand Blvd., 11th Floor, Glendale, CA 91203 (the \"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf LegalZoom and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or LegalZoom may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by LegalZoom or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or LegalZoom is entitled.</p>\n<p>You may download or copy a form Notice from http://www.legalzoom.com/arbitration-forms.pdf.</p>\n<p>You may download or copy a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association (\"the AAA\") website at www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>(c) After LegalZoom receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $75,000.\n(Currently, the filing fee for consumer-initiated arbitrations is $200, but this is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, LegalZoom will pay it directly after receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by these Terms, for all claims under $75,000 and the applicable rules as determined by the AAA for all claims of or above $75,000, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\n(You may obtain information about the arbitration process directed to non-lawyers, including information about providing notice to LegalZoom, at http://www.legalzoom.com/arbitration-information.pdf.) The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.&nbsp.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide.&nbsp.\nUnless LegalZoom and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your contact address.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf you choose to proceed either in person or by telephone, we may choose to respond only by telephone or submission.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a hearing.\nThe parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of any dispute or claim to which LegalZoom was a party.\nExcept as otherwise provided for herein, LegalZoom will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse LegalZoom for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nIn addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at more than $75,000 (excluding attorney\u2019s fees and expenses), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>\n<p>(d) For claims under $75,000, if, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of LegalZoom's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then LegalZoom will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pay you either the amount of the award or $2,000 (\"the alternative payment\"), whichever is greater.\nand</li>\n<li>pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the \"attorney's payment\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If LegalZoom did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\nIn assessing whether an award that includes attorney\u2019s fees or expenses is greater than the value of LegalZoom\u2019s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in his or her calculations only the value of any attorney\u2019s fees or expenses you reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding before LegalZoom\u2019s settlement offer.</p>\n<p>(e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorney's fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.\nHowever, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs.\nAlthough under some laws LegalZoom may have a right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration proceeding, LegalZoom will not seek such an award for claims under $75,000.</p>\n<p>(f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nYOU AND LEGALZOOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\nFurther, unless both you and LegalZoom agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other customers.&nbsp.\nNeither you nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other customers.&nbsp.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>\n<p>(g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.\nAn award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal.\nThe members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules.\nThe three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.\nThe decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.</p>\n<p>(h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice address, website link or telephone number provided herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of which we had written notice on the effective date of the change.\nMoreover, if we seek to terminate this arbitration provision, any such termination will not be effective until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>18.\n</strong>\n<strong>Installment Plan.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) <strong>Qualification.</strong> The LegalZoom Installment Plan (the \"Installment Plan\") is available as a purchase option for certain LegalZoom products priced at $200 or more.&nbsp.\nWhere an Installment Plan is offered, I acknowledge that LegalZoom may charge a small installment fee in connection with this option.&nbsp.\nThe total amount that will be charged for each installment payment, inclusive of any fee, will be disclosed to me prior to my election to participate in the Installment Plan.</p>\n<p>(b) <strong>Billing.</strong> By opting into the Installment Plan, I am agreeing to make an initial payment (the \"Initial Installment Payment\") immediately when I place my order or change my payment plan.\nI hereby authorize LegalZoom to charge my credit card for two additional installments on approximately, but not before, the first and second month anniversaries (each an \"Installment Billing Date\") of the Initial Installment Payment.\nIf my purchase date is on the 29th through 31st day of any month, an Installment Billing Date for months with fewer days will fall on the last day of the month.\nEach payment will be of the same amount, except that if the total purchase price does not divide evenly into three parts, my final installment payment will include all outstanding amounts.\nI understand that I may pay my outstanding balance at any time without incurring additional charges.</p>\n<p>(c) <strong>Default.</strong> If my credit card is declined LegalZoom may make multiple attempts to bill that card.&nbsp.\nIf I remain in default on the second payment when the third payment is due, I authorize LegalZoom to charge both the second and third payment amounts to my credit card.\nIf three attempts to charge my card are unsuccessful and my account balance remains unpaid, I understand that LegalZoom may report information about my account to credit bureaus, and that late payments, missed payments, and other defaults may be reflected in my credit report.\nI understand that LegalZoom may restrict my ability to purchase other LegalZoom products if I am delinquent on any payment.\nI understand that LegalZoom may make efforts to collect a delinquent payment.\nI understand that if I believe LegalZoom has reported inaccurate information to a consumer reporting agency, I may call the LegalZoom Customer Care Center at (800) 773-0888 and LegalZoom will investigate the matter.\nI understand that LegalZoom may accept late or partial payments, as well as payments that reflect \"paid in full\" or other restrictive endorsements, without limiting any of its rights under these Terms of Service.</p>\n<p>(d) <strong>Store Credit.</strong> I understand that if I have a LegalZoom store credit, the amount of that store credit will be deducted from my total purchase price before installment payment amounts are calculated.\nStore credit will not count against the $200 minimum purchase price per product.\nIf I want to apply a store credit issued after my enrollment in the Installment Plan, I may do so by calling the LegalZoom Customer Care Center at (800) 773-0888.</p>\n<p>(e) <strong>Notice of Automatic Billing.</strong> LegalZoom may send a reminder email to the email address of record for my account before my Installment Billing Dates.\nI acknowledge and agree that this notice is provided as a courtesy only, and LegalZoom is not obligated or required to provide such notice.\nI acknowledge and agree that (i) my failure to read, (ii) my inability to receive, or (iii) the failure of LegalZoom to send the email does not create any liability on the part of LegalZoom or any third-party service provider.</p>\n<p>(f) <strong>Disputed Charges.</strong> I understand that if I dispute a charge to my credit card, I should call the LegalZoom Customer Care Center immediately at (800) 773-0888 and LegalZoom will investigate the matter.</p>\n<p>(g) <strong>Account Information.</strong> I agree to notify LegalZoom immediately of any changes to my credit card number, its expiration date, and/or my billing address, or if my credit card expires or is cancelled for any reason.\nI understand that if my failure to provide LegalZoom with accurate, complete, and current information results in delinquent payments, LegalZoom may restrict my ability to purchase other LegalZoom products, report information about this delinquency to credit bureaus, and/or pursue further collection efforts.</p>\n<p>(h)<strong> Subscription Products.\n</strong>For subscription products offering the Installment Plan, LegalZoom reserves the right to terminate access to subscription benefits 31 days after a missed installment payment.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.\nFiling Fees.</strong> Except as otherwise noted, filing and recording fees may include all mandatory or applicable federal, state, county and local administrative fees, name reservation fees, initial reports, publication notices, capitalization fees, franchise tax fees, expedite fees, certified copy fees, walk-in fees, courier fees and other transactional fees incurred on your behalf by LegalZoom.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.</strong>\n<strong>Trademark Filing Fee:</strong> The government filing fee for trademarks can range from $250 to $750 per class.&nbsp.\nIn order to save customers\u2019 money, LegalZoom files using either the TEAS Standard system or the TEAS Plus system.&nbsp.\nAmong other things, these require electronic communications with and responses to the USPTO.&nbsp.\nThe fee you see from LegalZoom consists of the government TEAS Standard electronic filing fee of $350.\nIf the stricter \"TEAS Plus\" system can be used for your application, LegalZoom will use this system.\nThe TEAS Plus system streamlines the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (USPTO) review process and has a lower filing fee of $250, but requires additional LegalZoom labor to process.\nIf we are able to use the TEAS Plus system for your application, LegalZoom will still charge $350, of which $250 will be allocated to the USPTO fee and $100 to a LegalZoom processing fee.\nWhichever filing system used, if you later decide that you do not want to communicate with the USPTO via email, you do not want to file responses and documents electronically with the USPTO, or if the USPTO determines that you do not fit the applicable filing and examination requirements, the USPTO may charge you an extra $100 processing fee per class.\nThis fee, if any, will be assessed directly by the USPTO.&nbsp.\nLegalZoom will not pay it on your behalf.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.</strong>\n<strong>Trademark, Copyright, and Patent Submitted Material.</strong> As part of an order for certain trademark, copyright, and patent products, I may be required to submit to LegalZoom materials \u2013 such as specimens, drawings, or copies of my work \u2013 in order for it to complete my order and submit my document(s) to the relevant government office.\nFurthermore, I understand that while it may retain digital copies of my submission, LegalZoom does not retain physical copies of my submissions and will not return those materials to me.\nAll physical materials that LegalZoom does not submit to government offices as part of my application will be securely destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>22.\nAuthority to File Trademark, Copyright, and Patent Applications.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) <strong>Trademark and Patent.</strong> By placing my order, I give LegalZoom the express authority to file my application with the USPTO.\nAfter placing my order, LegalZoom may send me material to review or contact me for information regarding my order.\nIn either case, if I do not respond to LegalZoom within 7 days, it may file my application to avoid filing delays.\nI understand that I may be contacted by the USPTO for other information after my application has been filed.\n</p>\n<p>(b) <strong>Trademark TEAS Electronic Filing and Communications.\n</strong>LegalZoom may authorize the USPTO, on my behalf, to contact me at the email address I have provided in my order.\nI agree to submit documents and communications electronically using the USPTO TEAS system.\nI understand that if I fail to comply with these requirements, the USPTO may charge me an additional $100 processing fee per class and that LegalZoom will not pay it on my behalf.</p>\n<p>(c) <strong>Copyright.</strong> By placing my order, I give LegalZoom the express authority to file my application with the U.S.\nCopyright Office.\nAfter placing my order, LegalZoom may send me material to review or contact me for information regarding my order.\nIn either case, if I do not respond to LegalZoom within 60 days, it may file my application to avoid filing delays.\nI understand that I may be contacted by the U.S.\nCopyright Office for other information after my application has been filed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.\nLegalZoom Trademark Search.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each LegalZoom trademark search includes information about \"active\" federal trademarks (i.e., those displaying a status of \"LIVE\" \"PENDING,\" \"PENDING - INITIALIZED,\" \"PENDING - PASSED BY EXAMINER,\" \"PUBLISHED FOR OPPOSITION,\" \"ALLOWED - INTENT TO USE,\" \"PENDING - SUSPENDED,\" or \"REGISTERED\") as available in the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office (USPTO) website database at the time the search is conducted.\nA LegalZoom trademark search&nbsp;may not include information about \"inactive\" trademarks (i.e., those displaying a status of \"DEAD,\" \"ABANDONED,\" \"ABANDONED - MISASSIGNED SERIAL NUMBER,\" \"ABANDONED - NO STATEMENT OF USE,\" \"ABANDONED - VOLUNTARY,\" \"CANCELLED,\" \"CANCELLED - SEC.\n8,\" \"CANCELLED - SEC.\n18,\" or \"EXPIRED\") although marks with these statuses can, in certain circumstances, affect the registrability of your mark and/or your ability to use it in commerce.\nActive trademarks are those either currently pending or registered and presumed up-to-date with the USPTO, and can be used as a bar to a new trademark registration.\nGenerally, inactive marks will not be used to bar a new trademark registration, although an abandoned application can be revived under certain circumstances.\nMoreover, an individual may claim common law rights because of its commercial use of a trademark.\nWithout limitation, LegalZoom accepts no responsibility or liability for any impact that any inactive application or registration, or common law use, may have on your registration or trademark.</p>\n<p>LegalZoom strives to provide customers with the most thorough and up-to-date search results through the best available technology and trained search specialists.\nAccordingly, I understand that it takes all reasonable steps to ensure that the accuracy and completeness of searches is the best possible using its resources, including existing databases and personnel.\nFor due diligence purposes, trademark customers should thoroughly examine the search report and review to ensure that they are satisfactory and accurate before making any decisions regarding their trademark(s).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.\nLegal Forms.</strong> If you have purchased a Legal Form from LegalZoom, the following provisions apply to you:</p>\n<p>(a) <strong> License.</strong> LegalZoom grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable worldwide right to use the legal form(s) you have purchased.\nThis license allows you to access,

ARBITRATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Please read this carefully.\nIt affects your rights.</p>\n<p>Summary:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer's satisfaction by calling our Customer Care Center at (800) 773-0888.&nbsp;<strong>In the unlikely event that the LegalZoom Customer Care Center is unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction (or if LegalZoom has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in small claims court rather than in a court of general jurisdiction.</strong>&nbsp;Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than a court does, and is subject to very limited review by courts.<strong>&nbsp;Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis.\nclass arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</strong>&nbsp;While in some instances, upfront costs to file an arbitration claim may exceed similar costs to bring a case in court, for any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, LegalZoom will pay all costs of the arbitration.\nMoreover, in arbitration you may recover attorney's fees from LegalZoom to the same extent or more as you would in court.&nbsp;The arbitrator shall apply the same limitations period that would apply in court.</p>\n<p>Under certain circumstances (as explained below), LegalZoom will pay you more than the amount of the arbitrator's award and will pay your attorney (if any) his or her reasonable attorney's fees if the arbitrator awards you an amount greater than what LegalZoom offered you to settle the dispute.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may speak with independent counsel before using this Site or completing any purchase.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Agreement:&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(a) LegalZoom and you agree to arbitrate&nbsp;<strong>all disputes and claims</strong>&nbsp;between us before a single arbitrator.\nThe types of disputes and claims we agree to arbitrate are intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt applies, without limitation, to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory;</li>\n<li>claims that arose before these or any prior Terms (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>\n<li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.\nand</li>\n<li>claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to \"LegalZoom,\" \"you,\" and \"us\" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, employers,&nbsp;business partners, shareholders, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or products under these Terms or any prior agreements between us.\nBeneficiaries include, but are not limited to, those named in an estate planning document.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court.\nThis arbitration agreement does not preclude your bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies.\nSuch agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.&nbsp;<strong>You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and LegalZoom are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong>&nbsp;These Terms evidence a transaction or website use in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThis arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(b) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send, by U.S.\ncertified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\") to the other party.\nA Notice to LegalZoom should be addressed to: Notice of Dispute, General Counsel, LegalZoom.com, Inc., 101 North Brand Blvd., 11th Floor, Glendale, CA 91203 (the \"Notice Address\").\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\").\nIf LegalZoom and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or LegalZoom may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by LegalZoom or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or LegalZoom is entitled.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may download or copy a form Notice from&nbsp;http://www.legalzoom.com/arbitration-forms.pdf.</p>\n<p>You may download or copy a form to initiate arbitration from the American Arbitration Association (\"the AAA\") website at https://www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>(c) After LegalZoom receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $75,000.\n(Currently, the filing fee for consumer-initiated arbitrations is $200, but this is subject to change by the arbitration provider.\nIf you are unable to pay this fee, LegalZoom will pay it directly after receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by these Terms,&nbsp;for all claims under $75,000, and the applicable rules as determined by the AAA for all claims of or above $75,000,&nbsp;and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\n(You may obtain information about the arbitration process directed to non-lawyers, including information about providing notice to LegalZoom, at http://www.legalzoom.com/arbitration-information.pdf.) The arbitrator is bound by these Terms.&nbsp.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of the arbitration provision and the scope, enforceability, and interpretation of paragraph (f) are for the court to decide.&nbsp.\nUnless LegalZoom and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your contact address.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf you choose to proceed either in person or by telephone, we may choose to respond only by telephone or submission.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules will determine whether you have a right to a hearing.\nThe parties agree that in any arbitration of a dispute or claim, neither party will rely for preclusive effect on any award or finding of fact or conclusion of law made in any other arbitration of any dispute or claim to which LegalZoom was a party.\nExcept as otherwise provided for herein, LegalZoom will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.\nIf, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse LegalZoom for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.\nIn addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek relief valued at more than $75,000 (excluding attorney\u2019s fees and expenses), the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</p>\n<p>(d) For claims under $75,000, if, after finding in your favor in any respect on the merits of your claim, the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of LegalZoom's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then LegalZoom will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pay you either the amount of the award or $2,000 (\"the alternative payment\"), whichever is greater.\nand</li>\n<li>pay your attorney, if any, the amount of attorney's fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs), that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration (the \"attorney's payment\").</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If LegalZoom did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, you and your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney's fees, respectively, if the arbitrator awards you any relief on the merits.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney's fees at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.&nbsp.\nIn assessing whether an award that includes attorney\u2019s fees or expenses is greater than the value of LegalZoom\u2019s last written settlement offer, the arbitrator shall include in his or her calculations only the value of any attorney\u2019s fees or expenses you reasonably incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding before LegalZoom\u2019s settlement offer.</p>\n<p>(e) The right to attorney's fees and expenses discussed in paragraph (d) supplements any right to attorney's fees and expenses you may have under applicable law.\nThus, if you would be entitled to a larger amount under applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding you that amount.\nHowever, you may not recover duplicative awards of attorney's fees or costs.\nAlthough under some laws LegalZoom may have a right to an award of attorney's fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration proceeding, LegalZoom will not seek such an award, for claims under $75,000.</p>\n<p>(f) The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nYOU AND LEGALZOOM AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES AND NOT AS PLAINTIFFS OR CLASS MEMBERS IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR IN THE CAPACITY OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL.\nFurther, unless both you and LegalZoom agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other customers.&nbsp.\nNeither you nor we may seek non-individualized relief that would affect other customers.&nbsp.\nIf a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>\n<p>(g) If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or either party seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.\nAn award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal.\nThe members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules.\nThe three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.\nThe decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.</p>\n<p>(h) Notwithstanding any provision in the applicable Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to any notice address, website link or telephone number provided herein), that change will not apply to any dispute of which we had written notice on the effective date of the change.\nMoreover, if we seek to terminate this arbitration provision, any such termination will not be effective until at least thirty (30) days after written notice of such termination is provided to you, and shall not be effective as to disputes which arose prior to the date of termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nAdditional Terms.</strong> Some LegalZoom Services may be subject to additional posted guidelines, rules or

LegalZoom\u2019s Practices Regarding Consumer Information</u>\n</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consumers</strong>:&nbsp.\nThe vast majority of the information that LegalZoom collects comes directly or indirectly from the consumer that it relates to.&nbsp.\nInformation that is collected directly from you is information that you provide when you complete a form online, use a chat feature, or speak to us on the phone.&nbsp.\nWe may also collect information indirectly about you when you interact with our website, through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.&nbsp.\nIndirect collection

product offerings.&nbsp.\nAn example of the type of information that we may receive from these professionals includes the fact that a consult has occurred.&nbsp.\nWhile we cannot control what information legal plan attorneys share with us, LegalZoom does not intend to collect any information from attorneys where the collection would result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Partners and Affiliates:</strong>&nbsp.\nWe may collect information about you from our business partners and affiliates.&nbsp.\nAn example of the type of information that we may receive from business partners and affiliates is information about the product you purchased from them after you indicated an interest in an offer that LegalZoom presented to

Requests:</strong>&nbsp;If you designate a person or company other than LegalZoom to serve as the registered agent for your business entity, LegalZoom may provide your name and contact information to that party, if the designee requests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Required by Law:&nbsp;</strong>LegalZoom&nbsp;may disclose consumer information as required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, a

and Similar Technologies.\n<p>This section expands on how LegalZoom uses internet technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about consumers.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>.&nbsp.\nLegalZoom and its partners may use the standard cookie feature of major browser applications and third-party service providers, including Google Analytics features (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting), or employ internally developed cookies and tracking codes, that allow LegalZoom to store a small piece of data on a visitor's computer, or any other device a visitor uses to access our website, about his or her visit to the website or use of other plug-ins exchanging information with LegalZoom.&nbsp.\nWe also use similar technologies, such as JavaScripts or ETags, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users\u2019 movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may also control which cookies are placed on your browser when you visit LegalZoom\u2019s website through our cookie preference center.\nIf you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such order forms, will be limited.</p> My options <p>\n<strong>Web Beacons</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.\nweb beacons), that help us track referrals from our partners and affiliates and better manage content on our website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3rd Party Tracking.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other 3rd party assets (such as social media links) on the site is not covered by our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;These 3rd parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our site.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have access or control over these technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Partner and Affiliate Tracking.&nbsp;</strong>Our partners and affiliates, including Google Analytics (Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics and Interest Reporting), may use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.\nThis means that these partners and affiliates may show our ads on sites across the Internet based upon your previous visits to our website.\nTogether with our partners and affiliates, we may use these cookies and web beacons to report how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to your visits to our site.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you would like to learn more or opt out of receiving online display advertising tailored to your interests, please visit the Networking Advertising Initiative at&nbsp;www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp&nbsp;or the Digital Advertising Alliance at&nbsp;http://aboutads.info/choices.&nbsp.\nIf you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking&nbsp;here.&nbsp.\nPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.&nbsp.\nYou will continue to receive generic ads.\nIf you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your online display advertising opt-out choice.\nYou may also learn more about how Google Analytics uses your information by visiting Google\u2019s page&nbsp;How Google Uses Information From Sites or Apps That Use Our Service.&nbsp.\nYou may also visit Google Analytics\u2019&nbsp;Ads Settings&nbsp;to opt out of Google\u2019s use of cookies and customize Google Display Network ads, and Google Analytics\u2019&nbsp;Opt Out Browser Add-on for the web.</p> Third Party Links <p>\n<strong>Third-Party Websites.</strong>&nbsp;LegalZoom may maintain links to other websites and other websites may maintain links to LegalZoom\u2019s websites.\nThis Privacy Policy applies only to LegalZoom.com and not to other websites accessible from LegalZoom or that you use to access LegalZoom, each of which may have privacy policies materially different from this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.\nFor instance, when using Identity Protection products (including Business Data Protection and LegalZoom Identity Protection), you will visit websites maintained by LegalZoom\u2019s partner Experian, and the Experian privacy policy will govern the information you provide on that website.\n&nbsp;If you visit other websites, LegalZoom is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites.\nIt is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of non-LegalZoom websites to confirm that you understand and agree with them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media Widgets.</strong>&nbsp;Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook \u201clike\u201d button and widgets, such as the \u201cShare this\u201d button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.\nThese features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.\nSocial media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p> How You Can Control The Information LegalZoom May Have About You.\n<p>This section describes how you can access and control the information that LegalZoom may have about

our agreements.&nbsp.\nLegalZoom may maintain some or all of this data in its archives even after it has been removed from the Site.</p> Information Processed On Behalf of Third Parties <p>In some instances, LegalZoom may process Personal Information on behalf of third party affiliates.&nbsp.\nLegalZoom acknowledges that in these instances, you have the right to access your Personal
