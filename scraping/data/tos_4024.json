terms and conditions (\"Website Terms\") on which we, Just Eat.co.uk Ltd (\"we\", \"our\" or \"JUST EAT\"), provide access to our website https://www.just-eat.co.uk and any JUST EAT mobile application through which you order products (together, \"the Website\").\nPlease read these Website Terms carefully before ordering any products through the Website.\nBy ordering products through the Website (whether now or in the future), you agree to be bound by these Website Terms.\nUse of the Website is also subject to these Website Terms.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to change these Website Terms from time to time by changing them on this page.\nWe advise you to print a copy of these Website Terms for future reference.\nThese Website Terms are only in the English language.</p>\n<p>Use of your personal information submitted via the Website is governed by our Privacy Notice and Cookies Policy.</p>\n<p>For the avoidance of doubt, please note that references to \"Website\" in these Website Terms include any current or future version of our website https://www.just-eat.co.uk and any JUST EAT mobile application through which you access and use our Website, in each case whether accessed through any current or future platform or device (including without limitation any mobile website, mobile application, affiliate website or related website for accessing and using our Website that may be developed from time to time).</p>\n<p>By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms.\nIf you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any products through the Website.</p> I.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE AND SALE 1.\nINTRODUCTION AND OUR ROLE <p>1.1.\nCompany details: JUST EAT is a company registered in England and Wales with registered company number 04656315, whose registered office is at Fleet Place House, 2 Fleet Place, London, EC4M 7RF.</p>\n<p>1.2.\nVAT number: Our VAT number is GB 945 7192 91.</p>\n<p>1.3.\nProduct Orders: We provide a way for you to communicate your orders (\u201cOrder\u201d or \"Orders\") for products (\u201cProduct\u201d or \"Products\") to delivery or takeaway restaurants in the UK (\u201cRestaurant\u201d or \"Restaurants\") displayed on the Website.\nThe legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with and we will conclude the sale of Products on behalf of, and as commercial agent for, the Restaurants in all cases.</p>\n<p>1.4 Delivery Services: The majority of Restaurants on our Website provide their own delivery service in order to bring the Product(s) you order to you.\nIn this case, the Restaurant may charge you a delivery fee (which we will collect on behalf of the Restaurant).\nIn some cases, however, we provide the delivery services, and in those cases we may charge you the delivery fee ourselves (in respect of that delivery fee only, as principal, rather than as commercial agent for the Restaurant).</p> 2.\nWEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS <p>2.1.\nWebsite access: You may access some areas of the Website without making an Order or registering your details with us.\nMost areas of the Website are open to everyone.</p>\n<p>2.2.\nAcceptance of terms: By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms.\nIf you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website.</p>\n<p>2.3.\nRevision of terms: We may revise these Website Terms at any time.\nYou should check the Website regularly to review the current Website Terms, because they are binding on you.\nYou will be subject to the policies and terms and conditions in force at the time that you place an Order through us.</p>\n<p>2.4.\nResponsibility: You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the Website.\nYou are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.</p> 3.\nYOUR STATUS <p>3.1.\nCapacity and age: By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>3.1.1.\nYou are legally capable of entering into binding contracts with Restaurant.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3.1.2.\nYou are at least 18 years old.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.2.\nYou acknowledge and agree that if you have a specific food allergy or intolerance, you will contact the Restaurant directly to check that the food is suitable for you, before placing your order directly with them.</p>\n<p>3.3.\nAlcohol, cigarettes and other smoking products:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>3.3.1.\nYou acknowledge and agree that: it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 to buy, or attempt to buy, alcohol in the UK, or for any person to buy, or attempt to buy, alcohol, tobacco or other smoking products in the UK on behalf of any person who is under the age of 18;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>3.3.2.\nIf your Order includes any alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products, you will be asked to provide proof of your age on collection or delivery of your Order.\nIf you are unable to provide proof that you are aged 18 or over to the satisfaction of your chosen Restaurant, or if the Restaurant reasonably believes that the alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products you have ordered have been bought by you on behalf of someone under the age of 18, the Restaurant reserves the right not to complete the delivery of the alcohol, cigarettes or other smoking products to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 4.\nHOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED <p>4.1.\nCompiling your Order: Once you have selected the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provided the other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the \"proceed\", \"place my order\" or similar button.\nIt is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button.\nonce you do so you will be entering into a contract with the Restaurant and errors cannot be corrected (subject to paragraph 4.2.\nbelow).\nWhere you have not logged in or created an account previously, then you may have the option to continue with your Order as a guest.\nBy electing to complete your Order as a guest, you are agreeing that Just Eat will create a temporary Just Eat guest account for you which will, unless otherwise stated in these Website Terms, be accessible only (a) from the device which you use to place the Order.\nand (b) for a period of up to twelve months following the date of the Order.&nbsp.\nYour access to your temporary guest account will expire on the \u201cExpiry Date\u201d which shall be the earlier of (i) the date falling six months after the date on which you last accessed the temporary guest account.\n(ii) the date falling twelve months after the date on which the temporary guest account was created.\nand (iii) the date on which you logout of your temporary guest account, or clear the cache on the device which you used when the temporary guest account was created.</p>\n<p>4.2.\nAmending or cancelling your Order: Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraphs 4.4 and 5.6 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders and refunding of payment).\nIf you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.</p>\n<p>4.3.\nPayment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.</p>\n<p>4.4.\nProcessing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will send it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed.\nPlease note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each confirm that you have a contract for the sale of Products with a Restaurant but does not necessarily mean that your Order will be fulfilled by the Restaurant.\nWe encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order.\nHowever, Restaurants have the ability to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason.\nIn doing so, Restaurants will be in breach of their agreement with you and any payment made in respect of the order will be returned to you in accordance with paragraph 5.6 below.</p>\n<p>4.5.\nDelivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates.\nNeither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4.6.\nCommercial agency: For the avoidance of doubt, any orders processed by JUST EAT through the Website are processed by JUST EAT in its capacity as commercial agent of the relevant Restaurant.</p> 5.\nPRICE AND PAYMENT <p>5.1.\nVAT and delivery costs: Prices will be as quoted on the Website.\nThese prices include VAT but may exclude delivery costs (if you opt for delivery instead of collection) and any administration or service charge imposed by the Restaurant.\nThese will be added to the total amount due where applicable.</p>\n<p>5.2.\nIncorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices.\nIf the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website, we will normally contact you before the relevant Order is dispatched.\nIn such an event, neither we nor the relevant Restaurant is under any obligation to ensure that the Order is provided to you at the incorrect lower price or to compensate you in respect of incorrect pricing.</p>\n<p>5.3.\nPayment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website or in cash to the Restaurant at the point of delivery to, or collection by, you.</p>\n<p>5.4.\nCard payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of delivery or collection as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card corresponds with the receipt data for the Order.\nPlease note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions.\nthis may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.</p>\n<p>5.5.\nCredit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by JUST EAT, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card.\nPlease refer to our Voucher Terms &amp.\nConditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers.\nPlease note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially \"ring-fence\" the full amount of the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period.\nThe credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance.\nYou acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.\nWhere you use the Website as a guest, any account credit which you accrue against your temporary guest account can only be redeemed for an Order placed via your temporary guest account and cannot be transferred for use on another account.</p>\n<p>5.6.\nRejected Orders: Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will \"ring-fence\" the full amount of your Order.\nIf your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance.\nHowever, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer).\nYou acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.</p> 6.\nCUSTOMER CARE <p>6.1.\nGeneral: Customer care is extremely important to us.\nSubject to paragraphs 6.5 and 11, our Customer Care team will therefore try to assist you where possible if you have any problems with your Order.\nYou can contact our Customer Care team by clicking or selecting the \"Need help?\", \"Help\" or similar button or by calling the telephone number shown on the Website.</p>\n<p>6.2.\nQuestions about your Order: If your Order is taking longer than expected or you have any other problems with your Order, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to follow up on your query.</p>\n<p>6.3.\nChanging or cancelling your Order: If you wish to change or cancel your Order after it has been submitted and payment has been authorised, you may contact our Customer Care team as described above and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.</p>\n<p>6.4.\nComplaints or feedback: In the event that you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant, please consider providing feedback in the form of ratings, comments and reviews on the Website (together, \"Reviews\") to reflect your experience.\nThe Reviews are an important part of our quality control process.</p>\n<p>6.5.\nCompensation: If you are dissatisfied with the quality of any Products or the service provided by a Restaurant and wish to seek a refund, a proportionate price reduction or any other compensation, you should contact the Restaurant directly to lodge your complaint and, where appropriate, follow the Restaurant's own complaint procedures.\nIf you are unable to contact the Restaurant, or the Restaurant refuses to deal with your complaint, you can contact our Customer Care Team as described above within 72 hours of placing your Order and one of our Customer Care Advisers will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to request compensation on your behalf.\nPlease note, however, that the legal contract for the supply and purchase of Products is between you and the Restaurant that you place your Order with.\nWe have no control over Restaurants and the quality of the Products or service that they provide, and we are not able to provide, and have no responsibility or liability for providing, any compensation to you on behalf of any Restaurant.</p> 7.\nLICENCE <p>7.1.\nTerms of permitted use: You are permitted to use the Website and print and download extracts from the Website for your own personal non-commercial use on the

within the Just Eat group of companies (which means our subsidiaries and affiliates, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries and affiliates either now or at any time in the future) - these companies act for us and process your personal information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</li>\n<li>If you use a Takeaway Pay allowance with an Order, we will share personal data (email address and details about your Order and allowance) with your employer for the purposes of performing our contract with your employer.\nJust Eat and your employer have a separate responsibility with respect to the processing of your personal data.\nIf you have questions about how your personal data is handled, you should contact both Just Eat and your employer.</li>\n<li>Third parties who undertake various activities to promote and support our Services.\nThis includes offshore customer support agents, website and application support and hosting providers, marketing service providers, eCRM partners like Salesforce who manage our marketing emails and push notifications, companies like Twilio who send you text messages when your Order is on its way, delivery companies who deliver your Order to you, market research companies and payment processing providers which process payment card transactions - any of these third parties might be inside or outside your country of residence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As mentioned in section 2 above, we may also share information with third parties (for example, in the food, drink and entertainment sectors) so that they can contact you about goods or services which may interest you.\nWe will only share your information with these third parties where you have given your consent.\nIf you don\u2019t want us to use your personal information in this way or generally change your mind about receiving any form of marketing communications, you can unsubscribe at any time using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by amending your profile accordingly.\nIf you choose to unsubscribe from our marketing, we will keep a record of your preferences so that we don\u2019t bother you with unwanted marketing in future.<br>\nIf any part of our business enters into a joint venture, purchases another business or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed or transferred to the target company, or new business partners or owners or their agents and advisors.\nIn these circumstances we will always inform the relevant entities that they must only use your personal information for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Notice.</p>\n<p>Any law enforcement or regulatory body, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person.</p>\n<p>Any other person provided that you have given your consent to the disclosure.\nWe will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.</p> 3.\nLegal basis for processing personal information <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using your personal information as described above will depend on the specific context in which we collect it.<br>\nOur main reason for collecting and using your personal information is to perform our contract with you (i.e.\nto make sure you get your Order when you want it).\nHowever we will also use your personal information where it is in our legitimate business interests to do so (but only if our interests are not overridden by your data protection interests or your fundamental legal rights and freedoms).\nIn some cases, we may have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you (e.g.\nin the event of legal proceedings) or we might need to process it or share it with others to \u201cprotect your vital interests\u201d (this is legal speak for saving your life) or those of another person (e.g.\nin a case where another person\u2019s life is in danger).<br>\nIf we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (and we\u2019ll also explain the possible consequences of you not providing it).<br>\nSimilarly, we may collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party).\nRelevant legitimate interests include a) to market to you or make you offers that we believe will interest you.\nb) to analyse and understand how our services are used and so to improve them.\nc) for fraud prevention or prevention of other criminal acts.\nor d) to keep our systems secure.<br>\nIf you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d below.</p> 4.\nInternational data transfers <p>We may transfer your personal information to countries other than the country in which you are resident.\nJust Eat\u2019s website servers are mainly located in the Republic of Ireland and Germany, however our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Ukraine and United Kingdom.\nThis means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.<br>\nWhilst these countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country, you can rest assured that Just Eat takes care to implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information in those countries in accordance with this Privacy Notice.\nSome of the safeguards we rely on include, where appropriate, using the European Commission\u2019s approved standard contractual clauses with our suppliers, intra-group transfer agreements (so that we can safely transfer your data between the Just Eat group of companies all over the world).</p> 5.\nSecurity <p>We place great importance on keeping your personal information safe and secure.\nAs such, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures / industry standard technology to protect it from unauthorised access and unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage.<br>\nThe security measures we use are designed to provide a level of protection security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.\nWhere you have chosen a password which allows you to access certain parts of the Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.\nWe advise you not to share your password with anyone and to use a unique password for our Services.\nWe will not be liable for any unauthorised transactions entered into using your name and password.</p> 6.\nData retention <p>Just Eat will retain your personal information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, while you hold an account with us or to enable us to meet our legal, tax or accounting obligations).<br>\nIf you object to us processing certain categories of your personal information (including in relation to receiving marketing communications from us), we will retain a record of your objection to the processing of your information so that we can continue to respect your wishes.<br>\nWe will destroy or permanently anonymise your personal information at the point that we no longer need to process it for our ongoing legitimate business needs or for any legal reason.\nIf this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p> 7.\nYour data protection rights <p>Just Eat respects your privacy and data protection rights.\nBelow is a summary of your rights in respect of the personal information of yours which Just Eat handles:<br>\nJust Eat provides you with the tools to access, review or update your personal information at any time through your account.\nIf you wish to request deletion of your personal information, you can do so by contacting us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.<br>\nYou can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request that it be ported to a third party.\nAgain, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the \u201cHow to contact us\u201d heading below.<br>\nYou have the right to opt-out of receiving marketing communications we send you at any time.\nYou can exercise this right by using the unsubscribe functionality in the communication you receive or by amending your profile accordingly.<br>\nSimilarly, if we collect and process your personal information on the basis of your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.\nWithdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.<br>\nYou have the right to complain to a data protection supervisory authority about our collection and use of your personal information.<br>\nWe respond to all requests we receive from individuals wishing to exercise their data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>

follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies or those linked websites.\nPlease check these policies before you submit any personal information to such websites.</p> 9.\nUpdates to this Privacy Notice <p>We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time in
