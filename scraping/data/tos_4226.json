There\u2019s a one-click button in your \u201cProfile\u201d section to delete or to get a copy of your Personal Data.\nYou can also send us a direct request by contacting us here.</p>\nHow do we use your Personal Data?\n<p>We use your Personal Data for three reasons: 1) to provide you with our services.\n2) to ensure that our services are working properly and prevent attempts to break in our systems or use your Personal Data improperly.\n3) where there is a legal obligation imposed on us, or to protect legal rights.</p>\nChildren under the age of 16 are not permitted to use our services.\n<p>If you are under 16 years old, we will need your parents\u2019 or guardian\u2019s consent.\nWe\u2019re sorry, but if you are under 16, you\u2019ll have to sit tight just a little longer to use our service without their approval.</p>\nWhat happens when you register for our service?\n<p>Your email inbox reflects most of your digital footprint, <strong>Mine has developed a non-intrusive technology that reconstructs that footprint while collecting the bare minimum of data.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>When you register to our service, we will ask you to provide us your permission to connect to your email inbox.\nWe use methods such as \u201cConnect with Google\u201d, \u201cConnect with Yahoo\u201d, and \u201cConnect with Microsoft\u201d to securely access your email inbox.\nThese methods are based on the OAUTH2 secured authorization protocol, which means <strong>we don\u2019t have any access to your password.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Then, we will identify email exchanges between you and the digital services you interacted with (for simplicity - we call them <strong>\u201ccompanies\u201d</strong>) and present you with the list of these companies.\nOur technology scans <strong>only</strong>: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>the subject lines of the messages.\n</li>\n<li>the email\u2019s snippets - the first few words of the email, as presented on your email inbox\u2019s main page.\n</li>\n<li>the email\u2019s metadata - details that are not part of the email body, such as the sender address and the email date.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>During this process, we do not process or collect the content of any email in your inbox.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>Now that you can access your digital footprint, you can exercise your legal rights and send reclaim requests (right-to-be-forgotten) to the companies of your choice.\nEvery time you decide to reclaim your Personal Data from a company, the request is transmitted directly from your email inbox.\n<br>\n<strong>We help you send these requests, but we do not act as an agent on your behalf.</strong>\n<br>\n<br>To help you complete your reclaim requests faster and save you precious time, your requests will include the original subject lines of the last three email messages that you received from the company.\nThese will serve as evidence for the company that it holds your Personal Data.<br>\n<br>In some cases, deleting your Personal Data is not a one-click process.\nIn other cases, companies will reach out to you to further verify your identity or ask for additional information.\nTo make the deletion process more comfortable, you can view the responses and reply to the companies directly from Mine\u2019s app.\nWe will access and reflect the relevant email thread to you in real-time.\n<strong>We don\u2019t collect any of these email messages, your email messages remain in your own inbox.</strong>\n</p>\nWe do not sell, trade or rent your Personal Data.\n<p>\n<strong>We will never sell, trade or rent your Personal Data, for any purpose.</strong> We only share Personal Data with third parties in connection with the provision of the services to our users, for example, cloud environment, customer support, and web analytics.\nWhen you send a reclaim request to a certain company, we will share with that company the evidence to the fact that they hold your Personal Data.\nThis evidence is the subject lines of the last three email messages that the company has sent.\nPlease note that most likely that the company already has this information since it retains copies of the messages sent to you.\nWe share this evidence only so the company can verify and fulfill your request faster.</p>\nWe safeguard and secure your personal data.\n<p>We have built our technology infrastructure and AI on privacy-by-design principals that have gone through a strict external security assessment.\nWe treat your Personal Data as we treat our own data \u2013 with great care.\nWe invest resources, deploy measures, and follow procedures to provide a safe and secure environment for your Personal Data.\n</p>\nIf you decide to read our entire privacy policy, you should also play the lottery - you are one in a million.\nIn any case, we highly recommend you to read ours for further info regarding the use of your Personal Data.\nEnjoy!\nDiscover yourdigital footprint<p>Unleash yourself.\nRemove your personal data from services you no longer use.</p>Get started<p>ABOUT US</p>What we doWho we areMine for companiesPrivacy in actionFAQOur usersIn the pressContact usCareersBlog<p>LEGAL STUFF</p>Privacy policyTerms of serviceCookie policyCCPA privacy noticeVulnerability disclosure<p>Get the app</p>2021 Mine\u00aeAll rights reserved.Made with in Tel Aviv ", "created_at": "2021-06-29 19:41:11.717381", "updated_at": "2021-06-29 17:48:52.537639"}], "points": [], "urls": ["saymineapp.com"]}}
