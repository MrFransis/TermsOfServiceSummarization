distributed via partner firms and can be exclusively used within a Bitpanda System after having become a Bitpanda Client.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>6.3.\nEach Token Voucher has to be used in one single transaction.\nThis means that the Token Voucher may not be split up for different transactions but may be used only for one single Bitpanda Client Offer.\nThe exchange rates at the time of the use of the Token Voucher via Bitpanda Systems (and not at the time of the purchase of the Token Voucher) apply (see item 8.1.).\n</p>\n<p>6.4.\nEach Token Voucher is valid only for a period of 3 years after the date of purchase of such Token Voucher.\n</p>\n<p>6.5.\nEach Token Voucher is individualised and there is no possibility to recover any damaged Token Voucher or lost Token Voucher.\nAny such purchaser of Token Voucher is solely liable to keep the Token Voucher in such condition that it can further be used in the Bitpanda System.\nBitpanda assumes no liability for any damage or loss (including theft) of any Token Voucher by a purchaser of such Token Voucher and Bitpanda assumes no liability for any circumstances which are in the Token Voucher purchaser's sphere resulting in the fact that the Token Voucher cannot be used in a Bitpanda System.\n</p>\n<strong>7.\nBitpanda Index</strong>\n<p>7.1.\nBitpanda Systems offer the option to purchase, sell or exchange several E-Token in one transaction via the \"Bitpanda Index\".\nTo exchange and purchase/sell via Bitpanda Index, the respective provisions in section 3 (in particular 3.1.1., 3.1.2.\nand 3.1.3.) of these general terms and conditions shall apply equally.\n</p>\n<p>7.2.By using Bitpanda Index, you can create a number of Bitpanda customer offers with one 'click' and purchase, sell or exchange E-Token according to a predefined allocation of funds.\nThis means that the Bitpanda customer creates combined Bitpanda customer offers for E-Token according to the allocation of funds they have selected.\n</p>\n<p>7.3.\nBitpanda Systems offer different allocations of funds from which Bitpanda customers can choose freely and independently.\nThe weighting of the allocation of funds and the respective (re)calculation of the allocation of funds is carried out by external partners who are independent of Bitpanda (\"Index Provider\") and Bitpanda has no influence on this.\nYou acknowledge and accept that the allocation of funds is not created by Bitpanda itself and that the unlimited availability of the allocation of funds in Bitpanda Systems cannot be guaranteed at all times.\nIn particular, Bitpanda reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify or terminate the offered allocation of funds at any time and to exclude or remove individual tokens from the allocation of funds or not to include individual tokens in the allocation of funds if there are important reasons for this (e.g.\nregulatory requirements).\nBitpanda ensures that neither financial instruments nor other regulated financial products are included in an allocation of funds.\n</p>\n<p>7.4.\nThe current balance of E-Token held using Bitpanda Index is recorded and displayed in a separate wallet in the respective Bitpanda customer account (\"Index Wallet\").\nYou, as a Bitpanda customer, do not purchase a complete product or an index-representing token, but individual E-Token according to the allocation of funds you have selected (e.g.\nBCI5).\n</p>\n<p>7.5.\nThe allocation of funds provided by Bitpanda Systems are adjusted to the parameters (e.g.\nmarket capitalisation) specified in the respective allocation of funds (\"Rebalancing\") pursuant to a predefined period of time (e.g.\nat the end of the month).\nRebalancing creates corresponding Bitpanda customer offers for the exchange, purchase or sale of E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet.\nYou hereby confirm and grant Bitpanda the right to carry out the corresponding and periodic exchange, purchase and/or sale orders for E-Token according to the allocation of funds you have selected.\nIn addition, you accept and agree to pay all applicable fees in connection with the exchange, purchase and/or sale orders placed in the Rebalancing process.\nRebalancing will generally take place no later than four business days after the end of a period.\nBitpanda reserves the right, however, to only execute exchange, buy or sell orders within the scope of Rebalancing at its sole discretion once certain minimum sizes per order have been reached.\nYou are aware and hereby confirm that the rebalancing may have tax implications for you as a Bitpanda customer (see point 13.1.\nix).\n</p>\n<p>7.6.\nIt can sometimes be the case that certain E-Token included in the allocation of funds are not offered in Bitpanda Systems.\nIn such cases, Bitpanda will take appropriate steps to integrate these E-Token into Bitpanda Systems within a reasonable period of time.\nShould Bitpanda have successfully completed the integration of the respective E-Token, this E-Token will be added to the next Rebalancing and the corresponding Index Wallet at the price displayed in Bitpanda Systems on the day of the subsequent Rebalancing.\nThe actual extent to which E-Token are integrated into Bitpanda Systems (e.g.\ntrading options, wallet services) is at Bitpanda's sole discretion.\nIn particular, Bitpanda reserves the right not to provide a separate wallet in Bitpanda Systems for certain E-token included in an allocation of funds.\nin such cases you can only exchange the respective E-Token for other Tokens available in Bitpanda Systems.\n</p>\n<p>7.7.\nYou can exchange the E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet for other Tokens at any time by creating a corresponding Bitpanda customer offer.\nSuch a Bitpanda customer offer must refer to either (i) the total number of E-Token displayed and recorded in the Index Wallet or (ii) a proportionate number of E-Token displayed and recorded in the Index Wallet corresponding to the ratio of the selected allocation of funds.\nYou confirm and accept that such customer offer - in total or proportionate - may only be possible above a certain minimum amount.\nIt is not possible to exchange individual E-Token which are displayed and booked in the Index Wallet.\nAlternatively, you can transfer the E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet directly to the corresponding wallet in your Bitpanda customer account.\n</p>\n<p>7.8.\nYou acknowledge and accept that Bitpanda Index can be terminated or discontinued at any time.\nIf Bitpanda Index is terminated, Bitpanda will inform you of any such termination within a reasonable period of time.\nYou can then either sell or exchange (Swap) the Tokens displayed and booked in the Index Wallet or transfer them to the corresponding Wallet on your customer account.\nIf you do not take action, Bitpanda will credit the equivalent value (pursuant to the prices displayed and offered within Bitpanda systems) of the displayed Tokens and held in the Index Wallet to your Wallet or Fiat Wallet within a reasonable period of time (and deduct the respective fees incurred for this).\nThis is done at Bitpanda's sole discretion.\nThis notice period may also be waived for important reasons.\n</p>\n<p>7.9.\nThe E-Token recorded and displayed in the Index Wallet can neither be sent to other Bitpanda customers nor to wallet addresses outside of Bitpanda Systems.\nPartial removal of individual E-Token is also excluded.\n</p>\n<strong>8.\nPrices, Payment

paid and/or transferred by you immediately after the Final Offer Click.\n</p>\n<p>8.7.\nIn case of using Bitpanda Savings, you can choose between SEPA Direct Debit mandate or recurring credit card debiting as payment method: </p>\n<p>8.7.1.\nSEPA Direct Debit mandate: The respective payment amount is immediately payable and due for collection on the respective collection time, which Bitpanda can freely determine in advance.\nBy using SEPA Direct Debit mandate, you hereby revocably grant Bitpanda or a company affiliated with Bitpanda a SEPA Direct Debit mandate in order to collect the payments payable by you when due from your specified account by means of a recurring and regular SEPA Direct Debit mandate.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the time of collection from your bank account may be up to ten days prior to the respective recurring purchase time specified by you.\nYou hereby also authorise your bank to redeem the Direct Debits.\nYour bank is also entitled to decline Direct Debits, especially if your account does not have sufficient cover.\nYou have the right to initiate a chargeback to your account within 56 calendar days (8 weeks) from the debit date without stating any reasons (\u201c<strong>Direct Debit Chargeback</strong>\u201d).\nIn such case, the terms and conditions as agreed by you with your bank apply.\nPlease note: The claim due, according to the Final Rate accepted and confirmed by you in the Multiple Debit Order (as defined in section 8.2.7.) will remain payable in case of a Direct Debit Chargeback.\nSince you have been informed of the amount and the debit dates accordingly, you revocably waive the right to obtain pre-notifications before collections of Direct Debits are made.\nYou are obliged to provide sufficient funds on your account on the due date.\nIf collection via SEPA Direct Debit mandate is not possible (e.g.\nbank refuses or rejects the Direct Debit), you will bear any resulting costs (e.g.\nbank fees) and you authorise Bitpanda to execute a Direct Debit again on a later date.\nThis also applies to all costs incurred to Bitpanda in connection with a Direct Debit Chargeback and/or revocation of a SEPA Direct

amount is immediately payable and due for collection on the respective recurring purchase point in time specified by you in advance.\nHence, you authorise Bitpanda to charge your credit card

respective payment/transfer is not booked on Bitpanda's accounts (including Wallets and storages of Bitpanda) at the time when the respective CCOFA (as set forth under item 3.1.5.) has been completed by Bitpanda or a collection via SEPA Direct Debit mandate cannot be fulfilled (see point 8.7.).\nBitpanda cannot be in delay because Bitpanda either accepts an offer by completing the respective CCOFA or denies an offer in all other cases of not completing the respective CCOFA.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>8.10.\nIn the case you are in delay with your transfer, Bitpanda may charge reminder fees to a reasonable relation to the amount in delay/value of transferred Token in delay and as far as such fees are necessary to cover adequate costs of Bitpanda to administer such delay and enforce Bitpanda's rights (a total amount of at least EUR 5.00 up to a maximum of EUR 15.00 will be charged).\nIn case the respective Bitpanda Client does not settle debts within a reasonable time, Bitpanda reserves the right to entrust a debt collection agency with the collection of the claimed debt.\nIn such case(s) Bitpanda will additionally charge EUR 5.00 processing fee for claims between EUR 0 and EUR 500.00 and EUR

single Bitpanda Client.\nThe name of the payment service user must match the name of the Bitpanda Client attached to the respective Bitpanda Client Account.\n</p>\n<p>8.12.\nYou have to fully comply with the data disclosure requirements in the payment processes, in particular when paying via SEPA.\nIf you do not comply with the data disclosure requirements Bitpanda cannot match the respective payment with your Bitpanda Client Account with the consequence that Bitpanda has to start a manual tracking process, for which Bitpanda shall charge you a processing fee in addition to any damage claims (if any) according to item 4.3.\nabove.\n</p>\n<p>8.13.\nBitpanda reserves the right in all cases where a failure occurs with respect to payments from Bitpanda to you, which is in your sphere

Client's last disclosed email address as part of a delivery confirmation email.\n</p>\n<p>8.15.3.\nthe transaction is completed and cannot be reversed once the transaction appears on an external blockchain network.\nYou are aware and accept that from this point onwards Bitpanda has no influence anymore on the transaction and whether or not you have access to such transferred E-Token via your last disclosed wallet-address.\nYou are aware and accept that the transfer can only be accepted by a confirmation on the blockchain and that Bitpanda assumes no liability whatsoever that such confirmation is given.\nYou assume full responsibility for the receipt of the adequate transaction confirmation by an external blockchain.\n</p>\n<p>8.15.4.\nupon the transfer of the E-Token out of a Bitpanda System the assumption of risk, especially the risk of deterioration and loss, passes to you.\n</p>\n<p>8.16.\nYou are solely responsible for the accuracy of your own wallet-addresses outside of a Bitpanda System and for ensuring that they are correct and kept up to date.\nThis applies in particular to a transfer from a certain E-Token to a wallet-address which is meant for another E-Token (e.g.\nBitcoin to Litecoin).\nShould the E-Token be transferred to your last disclosed wallet address, the E-Token cannot be transferred back or sent to another wallet-address.\nBitpanda assumes no liability whatsoever for any failures with respect to wallet addresses outside of a Bitpanda System.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>8.17.\nYou are solely responsible for the accuracy of your own wallet-addresses

conditions.\n</p>\n<p>11.2.\nIn order to provide the Bitpanda Card Service to you, we have partnered with UAB Finansin\u0117s paslaugos, company code 304406236, registered in the commercial register of the Republic of Lithuania, having a head office at M\u0117nulio g.\n11-101, Vilnius, Lithuania (\u201cContis\u201d).\nContis is the issuer of the Bitpanda Card and is a member of the Visa card schemes (\u2018Visa\u2019), which will be used to enable your Bitpanda Card to operate as a regular debit card.\nWhen you sign up for the Bitpanda Card you also agree to the Contis Bitpanda Card Account Terms and Conditions (available at https://www.bitpanda.com/en/legal#terms-contis) and Contis Privacy Policy (available at https://www.bitpanda.com/en/legal#privacy-contis).\n</p>\n<p>11.3.\nTo be able to sign up and use the Bitpanda Card you must (i) have a fully verified Bitpanda Client Account, (ii) be a resident in the Euro Area (i.e.\nresident of a European Union Member State that has adopted the euro as its currency), (iii) have assets (i.e.\nany kind of offered and available token within the Bitpanda system) worth an equivalent value of at least EUR 100.00 within the Bitpanda system (including Bitpanda Pro) and (iv) have downloaded and installed the Bitpanda mobile app.\n</p>\n<p>11.4.\nYou can order a Bitpanda Card only on your legal name as registered with your Bitpanda Client Account.\nTherefore, please make sure your name registered with Bitpanda is spelled correctly.\nYou acknowledge and accept that you are only allowed to order and have one active Bitpanda Card per Bitpanda Client Account.\n</p>\n<p>11.5.\nYou can only use your Bitpanda Card at places where Visa credit and debit card payments are accepted.\nPlease note that you can connect up to two specific assets of your choice to your Bitpanda Card.\nThe default asset that you connect to your Bitpanda Card is called the \u201cMain payment asset\u201d (e.g.\nyour E-Token wallet for Bitcoin) and the optional asset that will be used as a fallback asset is called the \u201cFallback payment asset\u201d (e.g.\nyour E-Token wallet for Ethereum).\nPlease make sure to always have sufficient funding on your Main payment asset or Fallback payment asset as transactions can only be completed successfully if you have enough funds on these two assets.\nIf a payment is too big to be covered by the connected Main payment asset, the full amount will be deducted from the Fallback payment asset.\nThis helps to avoid failed transactions if your Main payment asset runs low on funds.\nIf neither the Main payment asset nor the Fallback payment asset cover the transaction costs (including fees), then the transaction will be cancelled and fail, and your card will be declined at the respective point of sale.\n</p>\n<p>11.6.\nAny payments and transactions made via your Bitpanda Card will be facilitated in EUR.\nThis means that whenever you use (i.e.\npurchase or ATM withdrawal) your Bitpanda Card the following happens: </p>\n<p>i.\nIf you connected an asset other than a euro wallet as your Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset, then the respective amount will be automatically sold from your connected Main or Fallback payment asset to your euro wallet.\nYou hereby grant Bitpanda the right to conduct such automatic sales (including trading premiums).\nThe sale will be performed in accordance with item 3.1.1 and item 8.2.4 of these GTCs.\n</p>\n<p>ii.\nThe respective amount sold to your euro wallet will then be deducted from your euro wallet to settle your purchase or transaction for which you used the Bitpanda Card.\n</p>\n<p>11.7.\nWhenever you use your Bitpanda Card and your connected Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset is deducted from a wallet other than a euro wallet, your respective Token will be sold and converted to your euro wallet.\nFor such a sale, the standard Bitpanda premium structure is applied.\nBesides the trading premium, an additional ATM withdrawal fee and a foreign exchange fee is applied.\nFees may vary depending on your BEST VIP Level.\nYou can find a detailed overview of all the fees here bitpanda.com/card#fees.\n</p>\n<p>11.8.\nPlease note that for certain payments and transactions such as reservations for hotels or car rentals or any other kind of deposits, we have to deduct the value of the respective payment upfront.\nThis means that the sale from your chosen Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset to your euro Wallet and the respective EUR deduction will simultaneously take place at the time you initiate such a payment or transaction.\n</p>\n<p>11.9.\nYou acknowledge and accept that certain limits (such as but not limited to spending limits, ATM withdrawal limits, the number of transactions you may perform within a specific time frame) may be applied.\nFurthermore, you acknowledge that such limits may change and/or be amended at any time at Bitpanda\u2019s sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p>11.10.\nBitpanda clients who are considered BEST VIPS are eligible to receive cashback on purchases conducted with the Bitpanda Card, if the chosen and connected Main payment asset and Fallback payment asset is an asset other than a fiat wallet (\u201cCashback\u201d).\nAny Cashback will be credited and paid out solely in BTC.\nThe Cashback amount you may receive is a specific percentage of your purchase conducted with the Bitpanda Card and depends on your BEST VIP level.\nYou hereby acknowledge and accept that the Cashback feature itself, amounts of Cashback and/or forms of payouts of potential Cashback may be amended, changed or terminated at any time at Bitpanda\u2019s sole discretion and you do not have a legal claim against Bitpanda to receive any kind of Cashback in any form.\nThe Cashback will be credited directly to your BTC wallet on Bitpanda after each successful transaction conducted with your Bitpanda Card.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the crediting of the Cashback may be delayed and Bitpanda shall not be liable for any losses arising out of or in connection with a late credit of Cashback (e.g.\nlosses due to price changes).\n</p>\n<p>11.11.\nIf your BEST VIP level changes before 11:00 PM CET, such a change will be reflected in your card conditions after 23:59 CET of the same day the level changes.\nFor example, if you go from BEST VIP level 1 to level 2 on Monday, at 16:00 CET, then all new BEST VIP benefits for your Bitpanda Card will start to apply on the same Monday, at 23:59 CET.\nAny changes in your BEST VIP level after 11 PM CET will be applied at 23:59 CET on the next day after such a change.\n</p>\n<p>11.12.\nOnce a transaction has been completed successfully, there will be an entry in your Bitpanda history, showing all transactions (including Cashback) conducted using your Bitpanda Card.\nBitpanda will strive to ensure that the transactions shown in the Bitpanda history and in your dashboard are current and accurate at all times.\nHowever, due to technical or other issues, discrepancies between the transactions shown in the Bitpanda history and the actual transaction might occur.\nYou hereby acknowledge and accept that Bitpanda will not be liable for any direct or indirect losses resulting out of any discrepancies between your Bitpanda history and the actual transaction.\n</p>\n<p>11.13.\nIf a transaction fails, you will receive a push notification (given you have enabled push notifications) with instructions on how to proceed.\nMost payments may fail due to insufficient funds in your connected wallet.\nMake sure you have enough funds in your chosen Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset to cover the payment amount.\nTransactions will also fail if you exceed your daily card limits, if your card is blocked or any other reason (such as but not limited to: you have entered an incorrect pin, your Main payment asset and/or Fallback payment asset was in maintenance mode while initiating the payment, a technical issue occurred on the merchant\u2019s side, etc).\nYou acknowledge and accept that Bitpanda will not be liable for any direct or indirect losses resulting out of any failed transaction for any reason.\n</p>\n<p>11.14.\nIf you receive a refund (for inter alia security deposits, cancelled transactions, chargebacks) such a refund will always be credited to your euro wallet, excluding Bitpanda trading- and transaction premiums.\nIf you have received Cashback for purchases that are, for whatever reason, refunded, you hereby grant Bitpanda the right to deduct the received Cashback directly from your euro wallet.\nIf your euro wallet has insufficient funds, the equivalent value will be deducted from the available Token on your Bitpanda Account.\nFurthermore, you grant Bitpanda the right to deduct funds from the available Token on your Bitpanda Account, should you have used your Bitpanda Card successfully (e.g.\noffline) without having enough assets on your Main or Fallback payment asset.\n</p>\n<p>11.15.\nFrom time to time, Bitpanda may add new services and promotions for the Bitpanda Card and will announce them to you accordingly.\nAll such new services and promotions may be amended, changed or terminated anytime at Bitpanda\u2019s sole discretion and you do not have a legal claim against Bitpanda to receive any kind of said new services and promotions in any form.\n</p>\n<p>11.16.\nIf you lost your Bitpanda Card, or your Bitpanda Card was stolen, we highly recommend to instantly block the Bitpanda Card in your Bitpanda mobile app.\nBitpanda will not bear any losses or damages caused due to lost or stolen cards.\nIn some instances, we will need to block the card for you.\nThis could happen for, inter alia, the following reasons: You have entered the CVV incorrectly 3 times and/or you have entered the PIN incorrectly 3 times.\nReplacements for stolen or lost Bitpanda Cards may be charged with a service fee from Bitpanda.\nIf you received a replacement for your Bitpanda Card, you must destroy and must not use your old Bitpanda Card.\n</p>\n<p>11.17.\nYour Bitpanda Card will renew automatically after three years and a new card will be sent to you at no additional cost.\nFor further information regarding termination please see item 13.\nand 19 of Contis Bitpanda Card Account Terms and Conditions.\n</p>\n<p>11.18.\nPlease note that Bitpanda, together with Visa, makes every possible effort to use state-of-the-art technology to keep your Bitpanda Card as safe as possible.\nWe would urge you to also use your Bitpanda Card cautiously and apply the necessary safety measures.\nTherefore, we highly recommend keeping the following in mind: Never share your CVV, PIN or SMS codes with anyone else.\nBitpanda staff members will never ask for your CVV, PIN or SMS code.\nIt is up to you to keep your card safe and Bitpanda does not take any responsibility for any mistakes or carelessness that may occur on your behalf.\n</p>\n<p>11.19.\nWith the Bitpanda Card, we strive to make it as easy and convenient for you to spend your digital assets in real life.\nBy doing so, we encourage you to also use your Bitpanda Card in line with this intended purpose (\u201cFair-Use-Policy\u201d).\nTherefore, Bitpanda reserves the right to withdraw or disqualify you from using Bitpanda Card and/or exclude you from receiving any kind of Cashback, if you are having mainly and/or consistently set your euro wallet as Main payment asset, and/or if you use the Bitpanda Card in any other harmful way or if you breach any of the clauses set forth in this GTCs or any other Terms of Bitpanda Group or its partners or subsidiaries.\n</p>\n<strong>12.\nData Protection</strong>\n<p>12.1.\nIn the course of delivering the negotiated services, Bitpanda is compliant with the GDPR as set forth in the Data Protection Terms.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<strong>13.\nRisks</strong>\n<p>13.1.\nYou as a Bitpanda Client understand and accept the following risks in connection with using Bitpanda Systems.\nIn particular, but without being limited to these examples, you understand the inherent risks set forth above and hereinafter: </p>\n<p>i.\nRisk of software weaknesses: The underlying software application and software platform, the Bitpanda Systems, mobile applications and System technology, the smart contract systems and other involved software and technology and technical concepts and theories are still in an early development stage and unproven.\nThere is no guarantee or warranty that the process for receipt, use and ownership of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software and related technologies and theories could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, in particular but not limited to token, Euros or any value of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units.\n</p>\n<p>ii.\nRegulatory risk: Blockchain technologies allow new forms of interaction.\nIt is possible that certain jurisdictions will apply existing regulations, or introduce new regulations addressing, on blockchain technology-based applications, which may have negative influence on the current setup of the systems and which may, inter alia, result in substantial modifications to the/any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units/Bitpanda System technology, including its termination or the loss of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units or any value which any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might have.\nBitpanda System technology is planned for a market, which is not regulated by financial markets rules.\nIt is the design and intended structure not to fall under any financial market rules and Bitpanda and Bitpanda Metals GmbH intend to design, modify and/or adapt the Bitpanda System technology in such way that financial market rules are not applicable on any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and/or Bitpanda System technology.\nRespectively within the regulatory risk category also changes in the Bitpanda System technology with respect to such adaptions, amendments and re-designs may cause termination or the loss of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units or any value which any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might have.\n</p>\n<p>iii.\nRisk of abandonment/lack of success: The allocation of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and the development of the any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units technologies might be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from industry, community and/or the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g.\ncaused by competing projects).\nRespectively even if Bitpanda System technology is partially or fully developed and launched, it could happen that any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units do not receive any functionality.\n</p>\n<p>iv.\nRisk of theft and internet vulnerability: The underlying software application and software platform, the Bitpanda System technology, the smart contract system(s), other involved software, other technology components and/or platforms may be exposed to electronic or physical attacks that could result in the theft or loss of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, or the theft or loss of private data, impacting the ability to develop, launch or use Bitpanda System technology.\nYou should be aware that SMS/messages and email services are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks and should use care in reviewing messages purporting to originate from Bitpanda or Bitpanda Metals GmbH.\n&nbsp;You should always log into your Bitpanda Client Account through https://www.bitpanda.com to review any transactions or required actions if you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication or notice.\nYou should note that phishing attacks often occur despite SMS or email or equivalent services, via search engines or ads in search engines, or other fraudulent links.\nNeither Bitpanda nor Bitpanda Metals GmbH take any responsibility for lost Token or any other funds due to spoofing, phishing or other equivalent attacks.\n</p>\n<p>v.\nRisk of blockchain mining attacks: As with any other public blockchain-based systems, the Bitpanda System technology may be susceptible to attacks including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, \u201cselfish-mining\u201d attacks, and race condition attacks or any other mining or non-mining related attacks.\nAny successful attacks present a risk to the Bitpanda System technology, expected proper execution and sequencing of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units transactions and expected proper execution and sequencing of software computations.\n</p>\n<p>vi.\nRisk of depreciation in value/extreme volatility: As cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are not regulated the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units is assessed differently.\nRespectively the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units in whatever form might experience extreme volatility and/or the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might decline to zero.\nAs additional cost with respect to regulatory or other risks might be triggered \u2013 and if such cost are added for the purpose of calculation to the value of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (whatever value you might give to the cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units) \u2013 cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units might also decline in their value to zero.\n</p>\n<p>vii.\nGeneral risk: There is no guarantee/warranty whatsoever on cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and/or the success of the Bitpanda System technology, expressed or implied, to the extent permitted by law, and that cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are created and obtained at the sole risk of the Bitpanda Client on an \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cunder development\u201d basis and without, to the extent permitted by law, any guarantees/warranties of any kind, including, but not limited to, warranties of title or implied warranties, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\n</p>\n<p>viii.\nMarket and community risk: You are aware of the risks of soft and hard forks and splitting including the broad possible changes to Bitpanda System technology which might be imposed by the market or community on Bitpanda/Bitpanda System technology.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>ix.\nTax risk: The tax consequences of the allocation or purchase of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (in whatever form) as well as the exchange of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, the holding of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (in whatever form), the alienation of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units (in whatever form) and/or any other action or transaction related to cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units may have tax implications at the level of a Bitpanda Client.\ntherefore, you should contact your own tax advisors on the tax consequences in connection with the cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units and the Bitpanda System technology.\nby making a Bitpanda Client Offer to Bitpanda, using Bitpanda Pro and/or by receiving, using or holding cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units, and to the extent permitted by law, you agree not to hold any associated party (including Bitpanda, Bitpanda's auditors, Bitpanda's contractors, Bitpanda's advisors, Bitpanda's employees or Bitpanda's founders) liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from making an Bitpanda Client Offer, using Bitpanda Pro, the allocation, use or ownership of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units or any other action or transaction related to cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units.\n</p>\n<strong>14.\nWarnings</strong>\n<p>14.1.\nInvesting in cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units is highly speculative with a risk of loss of the entire capital invested.\nSuch investment is only suitable for users, who can bear a loss of the entire invested capital.\n</p>\n<p>14.2.\nInvesting in cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units means investing in something totally new and unpredictable.\nSuch investment is only suitable for users, who want to take maximum risk.\n</p>\n<p>14.3.\nCryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are no currencies or means of payment and are neither accepted by states, central banks nor must a private person accept them in any way.\n</p>\n<p>14.4.\nBitpanda does not take any responsibility for the prices of precious metals and you trade in precious metals at your behalf and risk.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>14.5.\nBitpanda does not take any responsibility for cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units that are or tend to be collateralised, backed or pegged by a currency that is legal tender or any other asset of whatever form (e.g.\nstablecoins) as all actions in connection to such cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are in the sole responsibility of its issuer and Bitpanda has no discretion over such actions.\nYou agree and confirm that such cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units are collateralised, backed or pegged solely by the issuer and not by Bitpanda itself.\nTherefore, you cannot redeem or convert such cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units with Bitpanda.\n</p>\n<p>14.6.\nYou use the offered Bitpanda Systems at your own risk.\n</p>\n<strong>15.\nMiscellaneous</strong>\n<p>15.1.\nBitpanda manages the Bitpanda Systems with due care.\nNevertheless, systems for the exchange of cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units combine various new fields of experimental technology and it is very likely that interruptions, failures and other problems occur.\nNeither Bitpanda nor Bitpanda Metals GmbH gives any guarantee with respect to finding solutions for any such problems as soon as possible.\nBitpanda and Bitpanda Metals GmbH assume no responsibility other than to try to find solutions and therefore assumes no liability whatsoever for any damage caused by interruptions of a Bitpanda System because any such interruptions are immanent in an experimental field of technology.\n</p>\n<p>15.2.\nYou are aware that technology-based systems like Bitpanda Systems need maintenance work and development work and that for such work interruptions of the systems (planned and unplanned) are necessary and system immanent.\n</p>\n<p>15.3.\nBitpanda shall&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>15.3.1.\nvia business clients only be liable for any direct and foreseeable damage in the case of intent or in cases physical damages of persons negligently caused by Bitpanda.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>15.3.2.\nvia consumers only be liable for any direct and foreseeable damage in the case of intent, gross negligence or in cases of physical damages of persons negligently caused by Bitpanda.\n</p>\n<p>15.3.3.\nin no case be liable for indirect damages, consequential damages, especially regarding damages to other software, lost profit, pure property damages of a Bitpanda Client or third-party damage.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>15.3.4.\nin particular not be liable for damages caused by interruptions of Bitpanda Systems which are necessary for maintenance work or to avoid network disturbances and/or which are caused by inevitable occurrences which are outside Bitpanda's and Bitpanda Metals GmbH\u2019s control (e.g.\nenergy network disturbances.\nregulatory authority interference or on-site visits.\nstrikes, riots, environmental causes like earthquakes, storms, etc.\nwars or national or international conflicts with and without arms.\ninternational or national sanctions against certain products, services, persons, countries.\nlegal limitations to cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units at any time or place

Bitpanda Metals GmbH\u2019s sphere.\nA Bitpanda Client shall be informed immediately about the loss of data.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>15.3.7.\nassume no liability for (i) stored E-Token in any hot and/or cold wallet for a Bitpanda Client.\n(ii) information of the Bitpanda Client used for transactions into or out of Bitpanda Systems, (iii) transactions into or out of Bitpanda Systems, (iv) a Bitpanda Client or person using websites, mobile applications or services, not provided by Bitpanda or Bitpanda Metals GmbH such as third party wallet services or any other services of any third party and (v) any user's login data, Bitpanda Client login data, 2FA data, or other user data.\nIn using websites or services, not provided by Bitpanda or Bitpanda Metals GmbH such as wallet services or any other services of any third parties, Bitpanda and Bitpanda Metals GmbH expressly disclaim any liability for the third-party services and are not responsible for the performance of the third-party services or supplier.\nYou as a Bitpanda Client use these services completely at your own risk.\nFunds sent to such third parties cannot be reverted, as these parties are not willing to.\nWe can and will not check the reliability of these third parties.\nWe have no obligation to contact or solve the problem with any third party.\n</p>\n<p>15.4.\nBitpanda undertakes to care for the E-Token stored by the Bitpanda Client to the extent to which it is reasonably technically manageable in Bitpanda Systems and endeavours to store the majority of these \"cold\" \u2013 meaning offline.\n</p>\n<p>15.5.\n<strong>Tell-a-Friend Programme</strong>\n</p>\n<p>15.5.1.\nBitpanda offers a refer-a-friend programme for an undetermined period of time.\nA respective referral code for this programme can be found in the Bitpanda Client's Account.\nYou may recommend a person to register as a new Bitpanda Client (\"<strong>Promoter</strong>\") and to use the Promoter's referral code (\"<strong>Promoter Referral Code</strong>\").&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>15.5.2.\nYou, as a Promoter, receive EUR 10.00 in F-Token for every new Bitpanda Client Account created by using the Promoter Referral

applies).\nYou accept to meet these regulations and agree to help the support with the return of the digital currency or assets.\nThus, Bitpanda is entitled to a reimbursement of costs.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>15.7.\nBitpanda has the right to disclose any data to any competent authority if the data is requested to be disclosed by such authority in order to track or investigate any relevant cases under the Austrian Criminal Code (StGB).\nBitpanda reserves the right to cooperate with such authorities to the maximum extent possible.\n</p>\n<p>15.8.\nYou accept and confirm with each transaction hereunder that you accept and confirm these GTC in the current form.\n</p>\n<p>15.9.\nIf one or more of the provisions of these GTC or one or more of the schedules hereto are or will become invalid or unenforceable, or if one or more of the provisions of these GTC or one or more of the schedules hereto are or will become incomplete, the other provisions of these GTC and the schedules hereto will remain valid without limitation, save that the main obligations of the parties hereunder remain unaffected.\nSuch provision \u2013 having been found illegal or unenforceable in whole or in part, shall be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability only with respect to the jurisdiction in which it has been found illegal or unenforceable, without having any effect on any other jurisdiction.\nEach invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced or completed by a valid and enforceable provision in such a way that the new provision closely reflects the legal and economic effects the parties have concurrently aimed at in the invalid or unenforceable provision.\n</p>\n<p>15.10.\nChanges to and amendments of these GTC, including this clause, may be made by Bitpanda at any time and become effective at the earlier of (i) the Bitpanda Client accepts online the amended GTC or (ii) within 1 month after having

Bitpanda's right to enforce or exercise it later, provided that such right is not time barred, expired or precluded.\nAny waiver to this effect must be explicitly made in writing.\n</p>\n<p>15.13.\nBitpanda and you agree on English language with respect to our communication.\nSubject to the German terms in brackets referring to Austrian legal terms (which shall be interpreted only with respect to their meaning under Austrian law and with respect to the German language term in brackets), any other language used shall be only used for purposes of convenience.\nRespectively every communication or notice shall be made in English language.\nThe English language version of these GTC is the prevailing version.\n</p>\n<p>15.14.\nThe GTC and any transaction hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Austria to the exclusion of the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods and without giving effect to any statutory conflict of law provisions or rules that would cause the application of the law of any jurisdiction other than Austria.\n</p>\n<p>15.15.\nAny and all disputes or divergences or claims shall be exclusively dealt with the court having pertinent competence for 1010

book online trading platform called Bitpanda Pro where you can settle trades in E-Token and F-Token trading pairs.\nYou will find the available order books listed in your Bitpanda Pro Account.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the provisions set out in the GTC for Bitpanda Clients and Bitpanda Client Accounts apply likewise to Bitpanda Pro users and their Bitpanda Pro Accounts.\n</p>\n<p>1.2.\nAny person using or trading on Bitpanda Pro does so entirely at its own risk.\n</p>\n<p>1.3.\nIn these Trade Rules, the terms defined in the GTC apply likewise, except otherwise specified or referred to in the following overview and such definition shall be equally applicable to both the singular and plural forms:&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>Balance </p>\n<p>means the Bitpanda Client\u2019s total asset value on its Bitpanda Pro Account less any amounts held for Open Orders and fees.\nThe total asset value is the gross value of all your Token for the relevant Order Book with the value of the Quote Token based on the last trade price and including the Token allocated to Open Orders.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>Base Token </p>\n<p>means the Token being traded on the Order Book, namely the first Token in the trading pair (e.g.\non the BTC-EUR Order Book, BTC is the Base Token and F-Token is the Quote Token).\n</p>\n<p>Suspended Mode </p>\n<p>means that no new orders can be placed and Open Orders will not be executed.\nIt is only possible to cancel Open Orders.\n</p>\n<p>Limit Order </p>\n<p>means an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of a Token at a specified price.\nSuch Limit Order will only be executed at the specified price or a better price.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>Maker Order </p>\n<p>means an Order posted to the Order Book by placing a limit order below all pending sell orders for buy, and above the pending buy orders for sell.\nSuch Maker Order will remain open at that price on the Order Book until it is </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>cancelled.\nor </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>completely executed by one or more Orders placed by another Bitpanda Client at the same price.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Market Order </p>\n<p>means an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of a Token at the best available price of existing Orders on the Order Book.\n</p>\n<p>Order </p>\n<p>has the meaning given to it in point 2.1.\nof this Annex II.\n</p>\n<p>Order Book </p>\n<p>means each order book on which Orders are placed for trading in a trading pair offered on Bitpanda Pro.\n</p>\n<p>Open Order </p>\n<p>means an Order which has been placed but not executed, cancelled, deactivated or expired.\n</p>\n<p>Quote Token </p>\n<p>means the Token in which trading is denominated on the Order Book, namely the second Token in the trading pair (e.g.\non the BTC-EUR Order Book, BTC is the Base Token and F-Token is the Quote Token).\n</p>\n<p>Scheduled Maintenance </p>\n<p>means a planned temporary pause for maintenance or upgrades.\n</p>\n<p>Stop Order </p>\n<p>means an instruction to place an Order to buy or sell a specified quantity of a Token if and when the last trade price on the Order Book touches the price specified in the Stop Order.\nAfter placing a Stop Order it is active until it is executed (i.e.\nwhen price specified in the Stop Order is triggered).\n</p>\n<p>Taker Order </p>\n<p>means an order posted at the same price as one or more existing Orders.\nSuch a Taker Order results in an immediate execution at that price and to the extent of the total quantity of those existing Orders.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>Trade Rules </p>\n<p>has the meaning given to it in point 10.3.\nGTC.\n</p>\n<br>\n<strong>2.\nOrders</strong>\n<p>2.1.\nYou can instruct to buy or sell a specified quantity of Base Token at a specified price in the Quote Token (Order) provided that you have the required positive Balance of the relevant Token on your Bitpanda Pro Account which covers the total value of the Order and any applicable fees.\nWith placing an Order, the respective specified quantity of Token of such Order is set aside.\nFor purposes of effectuating a trade, you authorise Bitpanda to take temporary control of the Token that you are disposing of in the respective Order.\n</p>\n<p>2.2.\nOn Bitpanda Pro you can place an Order as a Limit, Market or Stop Order.\nYou can cancel an Open Order at any time before it is executed, and no fees will be charged for cancelled Orders.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.3.\nLimit Orders </p>\n<p>2.3.1.\nA Limit Order will be immediately placed in the Order Book and may result in a Maker Order or a Taker Order, or an Order that is partially a Maker Order and partially a Taker Order.\nThe placed Order will remain on the Order Book until you cancel it.\n</p>\n<p>2.4.\nMarket Orders </p>\n<p>2.4.1 Bitpanda cannot and does not guarantee that a Market Order will be executed at a specified price.\nYou agree and accept that a Market Order may execute at a number of different prices, based on the quantity of the Market Order and the quantities of the existing Orders on the Order Book at the time.\nIn particular, you are aware and accept that a Market Order may execute at a price less favourable than the most recent trade price, in some cases significantly less.\n</p>\n<p>2.4.2.\nA Market Order is always a Taker Order.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.5.\nStop Orders </p>\n<p>2.5.1.\nA Stop Order must be placed as a Stop Limit Order which posts a Limit Order when the stop price is triggered.\nSuch a Stop Order is not placed to the Order Book and is not visible to others, but any resulting Order (i.e.\nthe Limit Order when the stop price is triggered) is posted and visible.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.5.2.\nYou are aware and acknowledge that a Stop Limit Order is not guaranteed to execute.\nThe placed Order will remain on the Order Book until you cancel it or until it gets completely executed.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.6.\nMinimum order sizes </p>\n<p>2.6.1.\nFor Orders on Bitpanda Pro minimum order sizes apply.\nYou find current minimum order sizes on&nbsp;Bitpanda\u2019s Website </p>\n<p>2.6.2.\nBitpanda will periodically update order minimums as mentioned in item 2.6 to reflect the current state of marketplaces and value of assets.\nYou are aware and accept that such order minimums may change from time to time and are not guaranteed.\n</p>\n<p>2.7.\nExecution and Settlement </p>\n<p>2.7.1.\nExecution takes place provided that a Maker Order matches with a Taker Order and an Order may be matched with one or more Orders at the same price.\nThe matched Orders will be settled by Bitpanda immediately in form of the respective debits and credits to the involved Bitpanda Pro Accounts.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.8.\nMatching engine and order priorities </p>\n<p>2.8.1.\nBitpanda Pro matches Taker Orders with Open Maker Orders on each Order Book based on price-time priority.\nThis means that each time a Taker Order is placed this order is matched with the earliest in time Maker Order at the best price on the Order Book.\nShould the Taker Order not be completely fulfilled, it may be matched with any subsequent Maker Orders at that price, in the sequence those Maker Orders were posted.\nShould such a Taker Order still not be completely executed as described previously, it is matched with one or more Maker Orders at the next best price, in the sequence those Maker Orders were posted.\nThis process is repeated until the Taker Order is completely executed.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.9.\nTrading fees </p>\n<p>2.9.1.\nOrders are charged with a maker fee for each Maker Order and a taker fee for each Taker Order posted on the Order Book.\nFees will be charged in the Token you receive and are calculated as a percentage of the Order quantity.\nFor example: on the BTC-EUR Order Book, you, as a buyer of BTC, pay fees in BTC and the seller of BTC pays fees in EUR.\nFees are charged on a per trade basis and will be deducted automatically once an Order is matched.\nIf an Order qualifies partially as a Maker Order and partially as a Taker Order, a maker fee applies to the part posted as a Maker Order and a taker fee applies to the part posted as a Taker Order.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.9.2.\nYou are aware and accept that trading fees may vary from time to time and between Order Books.\nAny such updated fees will apply prospectively to any Orders or other transactions that take place following the effective date of such updated fees.\nFurthermore, you are aware and acknowledge that fees will be deducted from your respective Bitpanda account as set forth under item 10.3.\nin this GTC.\nThe current Bitpanda Pro trading fees are displayed at https://www.bitpanda.com/en/pro/fees </p>\n<p>2.9.3.\nBitpanda offers volume-based fee discounts.\nThe current fee discounts can be found at https://www.bitpanda.com/en/pro/fees.\nYou are aware and accept that fee discounts are not guaranteed and may change or be abandoned anytime at Bitpanda\u2019s sole discretion.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.10.\nMarket Integrity </p>\n<p>2.10.1.\nAll executed Orders are final and won\u2019t be cancelled except where (i) Bitpanda is obliged to do so pursuant to applicable law or regulations or (ii) due to a material technical error (e.g.\nOrders or executions do not comply with these rules).\nIn case of a technical error Bitpanda will make all reasonable efforts and act in good faith in accordance with industry standards in order to restore the positions which would have been without the occurrence of an error.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.10.2.\nBitpanda has the right to cancel Open Orders in the following circumstances: </p>\n<p>i.Orders placed by Bitpanda Clients who have infringed the GTC, in particular rules set out in item 4.\nof the GTC which apply to Bitpanda Pro Accounts likewise and/or using the API in a manner that unreasonably burdens the platform.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>ii.\nOrders involving an obvious error with respect to price, quantity, or other parameters.\n</p>\n<p>iii.\nIf required for technical reasons or by any applicable law or regulation.\n</p>\n<p>2.10.3.\nIn general, Bitpanda has the right to take any action (e.g.\nhalting of trading, restrict access, modifying parameters in order to mitigate risks, cancelling Orders resting in the Order Book, or any other actions deemed to be in the best interest of Bitpanda Pro) or deemed appropriate to ensure and preserve the market integrity of Bitpanda Pro.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.11.\nInterruptions </p>\n<p>2.11.1.\nIn case of the occurrence of technical errors preventing or negatively impacting a Bitpanda Client\u2019s ability to properly use Bitpanda Pro (e.g.\nplacing/cancelling of Orders, access to Bitpanda Systems and APIs) it is at Bitpanda\u2019s sole discretion to take adequate measures in respect of one or more Order Books, in particular: </p>\n<p>i.\ntemporarily disable depositing or withdrawing Token.\n</p>\n<p>ii.\ncancel Open Orders.\n</p>\n<p>iii.\ndisable the option to place new Orders (you can only cancel existing ones), to sign-in, to access Bitpanda Proe and/or to access via APIs.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.12.\nProhibitions </p>\n<p>2.12.1.\nBitpanda Clients using Bitpanda Pro are not allowed to place Orders which result in self-execution (i.e.\nthe same Bitpanda Client would act as both the maker and taker for the trade), such Orders will be rejected.\nIf two Orders of different quantities would result in self-execution, the smaller Order is cancelled, and the larger Order is decremented by an amount equivalent to the smaller quantity.\nThe remainder of the larger Order remains open.\n</p>\n<p>2.12.2.\nFurther, you are prohibited from engaging in any market manipulation (specifically includes, without limitation: front-running, wash trading, spoofing, layering, churning, and quote stuffing).\nMarket manipulation of any kind (including action on Bitpanda Systems or outside of Bitpanda Systems) is strictly prohibited.\nMarket manipulation is any action taken by any market participant or a person acting in concert with a participant which intends to: </p>\n<p>i.\nscam or mislead other traders.\n</p>\n<p>ii.\ncontrol or manipulate the price or trading volume of a Token.\nor </p>\n<p>iii.\nassist, encourage, facilitate, finance, endorse or support either of the above.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.12.3.\nBitpanda does not use circuit breakers or automated trading halts based on predetermined price bands.\nHowever, as provided in section 2.10.\nand 2.11., Bitpanda may, at its sole discretion, halt trading or take other action that seems appropriate to attain market integrity, prevent market manipulation or to maintain the proper operation of Bitpanda Systems.\n</p>\n<p>2.13.\nTransparency and information </p>\n<p>2.13.1.\nBitpanda grants to every Bitpanda Client equal access right to Bitpanda Pro including its APIs.\nIn addition, all users of Bitpanda Pro receive full and real-time access to the available market information shown on Bitpanda Systems.\nMarket information contains the following: </p>\n<p>i.\nLimit Orders placed on the Order Books (price and quantity).\nand </p>\n<p>ii.\nall executions (price, quantity and time) </p>\n<p>2.13.2.\nBitpanda Systems do not show Stop Orders which have been placed but not yet triggered and any information about which user placed or cancelled an Order.\n</p>\n<p>2.13.3.\nBitpanda also trades its corporate funds on Bitpanda Pro.\nHowever, it does not have any special priority and these Trade Rules apply without exceptions for Bitpanda, in particular with the same market information and without access to inside information.\nBitpanda does not engage in front-running.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.13.4.\nThe same applies for all Bitpanda employees (including employees of Bitpanda group).\nBitpanda group prohibits all its employees from using insider, corporate or similar information to trade Token.\nSuch employees are subject to internal trading policies and trade surveillance programmes.\n</p>\n<p>2.14.\nApplication Programming Interfaces </p>\n<p>2.14.1.\nBitpanda may provide access to specific data and information through APIs (\u2018Application Programming Interface\u2019).\nYou can only use these in their original and unmodified state and via your Bitpanda Client Account.\nUpon completion of the application for the creation of an API key you will receive an email with a confirmation link.\nAfter clicking on the link in the email you will receive the API key which is the only time the API key is displaced.\nIf you do not remember this API key in the future, you might have to create a new one.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>2.14.2.\nYou are aware and accept that the scope and concrete form of APIs is at Bitpanda\u2019s sole discretion and that APIs may be modified or abandoned by Bitpanda at its sole discretion anytime.\nBitpanda may set limits on the number of API calls that may be made at its sole discretion.\nIf you exceed these limits or violate any other terms in this Trade Rules or GTC, Bitpanda may moderate your activity or cease offering you access to the APIs at its sole discretion.\n</p>\n<p>2.14.3.\nYou grant Bitpanda a fully paid-up, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable right and licence under all of your intellectual property rights to (i) use your name, likeness or brand including all of your trademarks, logos (Logos), etc to the extent it is incorporated into your

your application to provide, maintain, develop and market the Bitpanda Systems and services.\nUpon termination or abandonment of your API and written request from you, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to remove reference to your application and any of your Logos from our Bitpanda Systems.\n</p>\n<p>2.14.4.\nOur brands and names (Bitpanda Logos), and all intellectual property

always be able to access, use or carry out transactions using your Bitpanda Pro Account.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<strong>Annex III</strong>\n<p>Bitpanda Fork Policy </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>A fork is a situation in which a blockchain splits into two separate chains temporarily or permanently (\"Fork\").\nForks are a natural occurrence during mining, where two chains following the same consensus rules temporarily have the same accumulated proof-of-work and are both considered valid.\nThey can also occur as a consequence of the use of two distinct sets of rules trying to govern the same blockchain.\nForks have been used in cryptocurrencies in order to add new features to a blockchain or to reverse the effects of hacking or catastrophic bugs on a blockchain as was the case with the fork between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nNotably, Forks have been widely discussed in the context of the bitcoin scalability problem.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bitpanda does not automatically support Forks of any cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bitpanda assesses each case, and each Fork on a case by case basis and Bitpanda may at its sole discretion decide whether to support a Fork or not and whether to communicate that to you or not.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Bitpanda decides not to support a Fork but you want to participate in a Fork, you would have to move the respective E-Token onto such third-party wallet which you think fits for supporting such a Fork.\nBitpanda herewith advises you to take enough time into consideration to move the respective E-Token, because Bitpanda cannot and will not give any guarantees to any transfers out of/outside of Bitpanda Systems.\nBitpanda does not advise on how much time is enough but suggests that you carefully consider all relevant facts.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You must monitor the market by yourself to stay informed about Forks.\nBitpanda has no duty to inform you of any Forks.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bitpanda may decide at its sole discretion to suspend/temporarily shut down any exchange, trading or any transaction with respect to E-Token which are part of a Fork or influenced by a Fork to a major extent.\nThis applies to Forks which are supported by Bitpanda and also to Forks which are not supported by Bitpanda.&nbsp.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If Bitpanda decides \u2013 at Bitpanda's sole discretion \u2013 to try to support a Fork, Bitpanda shall decide which chain is the original blockchain in the fork scenario.\nConsequently, Bitpanda shall inform you of such decisions and will endeavour to integrate the new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units resulting from the Fork into Bitpanda Systems.\nHowever, Bitpanda gives no guarantee that such integration takes place and shall inform you at its sole discretion on when and how and at which distribution rate such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units resulting from the Fork can be used in Bitpanda Systems.\nRespectively, Bitpanda holds any resulting new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units balances for and on behalf of you from the time of the split until the time of distribution to you in cold storage (meaning offline).\nYou are aware and accept that it is impossible to withdraw/or transfer any such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units balances out of a supported Fork until Bitpanda decides at Bitpanda's sole discretion to go live with such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units in Bitpanda Systems.\nYou are aware and accept that there might be situations where Bitpanda may decide in a commercially reasonable way not to integrate such new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units in &nbsp;Bitpanda Systems and that in such cases you have no right to claim damages or compensation of any kind from Bitpanda.\nYou are aware that Bitpanda will always only <u>try</u> to integrate new cryptographic blockchain-based digital information units but in no case gives any guarantee that such integration can be done or is fixed for a certain point in time.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol> ", "created_at": "2021-03-31 16:56:38.723148", "updated_at": "2021-03-31 16:56:46.413308"}, {"id": 4560, "name": "BugBounty Programme", "url":

the requirements for a compliant bug report under point \"Complete Bug Report\".\n</p>\n<strong>First Reporter Rule</strong>\n<p>A Security Researcher reporting an issue first is called the First Reporter.\nRewards for a specific vulnerability go to the First Reporter.\nA subsequent bug report reporting the same or similar vulnerability will not be eligible for a reward (first come first serve principle).\nProvided that Bitpanda is already aware of a specific vulnerability at the time of a submitted bug report reporting the same or similar vulnerability as already known, Bitpanda is deemed to be the First Reporter.\n</p>\n<strong>Rewards</strong>\n<p>Bitpanda grants rewards (also called bounty and/or bounties) for reporting software vulnerabilities in accordance with this Programme.\nRewards may be granted if the following requirements called the \u201cResearcher Requirements\u201d are collectively fulfilled: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Responsible Investigation (description in point \"Responsible Investigation\").\n</li>\n<li>Complete Bug Report (description in point \"Complete Bug Report\").\n</li>\n<li>Eligibility of Vulnerability (description in point \"Eligibility of Vulnerability\").\nand </li>\n<li>Responsible Disclosure (description in point \"Responsible Disclosure\").</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If just one of the above requirements is not fulfilled, this has to be assessed as a non-compliance with this Programme.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>Bitpanda decides at its sole and own discretion whether a reward is granted and the exact amount of such bounty.\nA granted reward will be paid to the Bitpanda fiat wallet (EUR) in the Bitpanda user account of the respective successful First Reporter.\nThis means that a First Reporter requires a user account on the Bitpanda platform for receiving the reward.\nIf a Security Researcher that is qualified as a respective First Reporter is not able to set up a user account on the Bitpanda platform (e.g.\nSecurity Researcher holds citizenship of or is located in jurisdiction that is excluded from Bitpanda\u2019s services due to regulatory reasons, AML/KYC considerations, etc), Bitpanda may, at its own discretion - and out of pure good will - arrange another form of granting the Reward to the successful First Reporter.\nSecurity Reporter acknowledges and accepts, that he has no legal claim against Bitpanda for payment of any Reward in case he is not able to set up a user account on the Bitpanda platform.\n</p>\n<strong>Responsible Investigation</strong>\n<p>Every investigation must be done responsibly.\nResponsible investigation includes, but is not limited to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not destroy data or disrupt or compromise Bitpanda's services or support third parties with such actions.\n</li>\n<li>Do not violate the privacy or any rights of Bitpanda's users or support third parties with such actions.\n</li>\n<li>Do your research in own name and for own account.\nOnly target your personal account.\nThe interaction with any other user account(s) is strictly forbidden, in particular, but without limitation to: <ol>\n<li>Targeting or an attempt to target other user accounts.\n</li>\n<li>Any kind of disruption and or damaging of other user accounts or/and a user's rights.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Do not use, attempt or be involved in any kind of <ol>\n<li>Social Engineering </li>\n<li>Spam </li>\n<li>Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDOS) </li>\n<li>Attacking any kind of physical security measures</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any non-responsible investigation action will result in an exclusion of the Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme.\n</p>\n<strong>Complete Bug Report</strong>\n<p>Bitpanda needs a documentation of the existing vulnerability.\nThis is called a bug report.\nBitpanda can only accept complete bug reports, after sending it to bugreport@bitpanda.com.\n</p>\n<p>A bug report is complete, if Bitpanda can reproduce the bug and can assess the potential impact.\n</p>\n<p>How can I make sure it is complete? </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add as much information in your report as you can.\n</li>\n<li>Add a complete description of the bug.\n</li>\n<li>Point out the potential impact of the bug.\n</li>\n<li>Provide guidance to reproduce the bug (proof of concept).</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Eligibility of Vulnerability</strong>\n<p>In general, every bug in a Bitpanda Service leading to a relevant vulnerability could be eligible for a reward.\nThe focus lies on: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leakage of data </li>\n<li>Classification of endangered data </li>\n<li>Compromising the security of user funds </li>\n<li>Compromising the integrity of Bitpanda's trading system</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>In the following you find some examples for security issues which may be eligible for a reward in accordance with this Programme:</u>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leakage of data </li>\n<li>Getting malicious access to user funds </li>\n<li>Price manipulation within the platform </li>\n<li>Code injection </li>\n<li>Cross-site scripting (XSS) </li>\n<li>Cross-site request forgery (\u200eCSRF) </li>\n<li>Remote code execution </li>\n<li>Privilege escalation </li>\n<li>Clickjacking </li>\n<li>Authentication bypass </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities of Non-Bitpanda Services <u>directly leading to a relevant impact on a Bitpanda Service</u>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All vulnerabilities of Bitpanda Services that require or are related to the following are not eligible for a bug report and/or reward and called ineligible vulnerabilities.\nSuch ineligible vulnerabilities are in particular: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>UX issues not relating to security impacts </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities of any third-party software or application that interact with Bitpanda Services </li>\n<li>Social engineering &amp.\nidentity theft actions </li>\n<li>Attacking of physical security, DDOS, spamming etc.\n</li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities of Non-Bitpanda Services not leading to a relevant impact on a Bitpanda Service.\n</li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities related to outdated, unpatched browsers or operating systems </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities that not have been responsibly investigated (see point \"Responsible Investigation\") </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities that not have been completely reported (see point \"Complete Bug Report\") </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities that have been known by us or reported by someone else first.\n(see point \"First Reporter Rule\") </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities Bitpanda can't reproduce </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities Bitpanda can't reasonably fix or do anything about it (e.g.\nheartbleed bug, or bugs concerning telecommunication systems) </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities in any open-source library </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities in existing banking functionalities (e.g.\ncredit card, wire transfers) which can lead to any kind of abuse</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The eligibility of a vulnerability is assessed solely and exclusively by Bitpanda.\n</p>\n<strong>Responsible Disclosure</strong>\n<p>Security Researchers must adhere to and follow the principles of \u201cResponsible Disclosure\u201d as outlined in the following.\nResponsible disclosure rules are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharing any information of the vulnerability to any third party is prohibited.\n</li>\n<li>The Security Researcher must provide Bitpanda a reasonable amount of time to fix the vulnerability.\n</li>\n<li>Defrauding Bitpanda itself or any users of Bitpanda Services is prohibited.\n</li>\n<li>Allowing, enabling or supporting other parties to defraud Bitpanda itself or any user of Bitpanda Services is prohibited.\n</li>\n<li>Gaining any profit for your own or allowing third parties to gain any profit from the vulnerability is prohibited (exception: the bounty pursuant to this Programme) </li>\n<li>Sharing of any gained sensitive information to any other third party is prohibited.\n</li>\n<li>Reports must be done without any demands, threats, ransoms or any other conditions </li>\n<li>Security Researchers shall make sure that the integrity and confidentiality of the detected issues and any of Bitpanda's user data is secured and preserved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any breaking or neglection of these rules will be a violation of the Bitpanda Bug Bounty Programme.\n</p>\n<strong>Rewards Structure</strong>\n<p>The reward that can be expected for your bug report depends on the severity of the reported vulnerability.\nThe table below will give you a general guideline what you can expect for your investigation efforts: </p>Vulnerability Reward in EUR (net) Critical dependent on severeness of vulnerability High 500.00 Medium 50.00 Low 5.00 <p>The above mentioned amounts are minimum bounties for each level of vulnerability.\nA concrete bounty may excess the minimum amount based on the severity of the vulnerability and/or the Security Researcher's technique and reporting quality.\nThe granted reward will be determined by the impact on the Bitpanda Service.\n</p>\n<p>Previous granted bounty amounts are not considered precedent for future bounty amounts.\n</p>\n<strong>Evaluation of a bug report</strong>\n<p>The evaluation of your complete bug report will be done solely by Bitpanda.\nAs mentioned the 4 researcher parameters stated out in point \"Rewards\" must be fulfilled to be evaluated as a valid bug report.\nThe impact of the found vulnerability will determine the reward as described in point \"Rewards Structure.\nThe reported bug or vulnerability will be evaluated based on two factors: Impact and Exploitability.\n</p>\n<p>To give you an idea, how this works we provide you with some easy examples.\n</p>\n<strong>Impact</strong>\n<p>Impact in general means the damage an abuser can cause.\nThis refers but is not limited to financial damages, functional damages, exploitation on confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive information &amp.\ndamages which could result in reputational damages.\n</p>\n<p>The scope of evaluation concerning the impact ranges from low to critical.\n</p>\n<strong>Examples</strong>\n<p>\n<em>Critical:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Manipulating funds balances (fiat or cryptocurrency) </li>\n<li>Reading, changing or exporting of large amounts of sensitive data.\n</li>\n<li>Heavy interruption or exploitation of the Bitpanda trading engine.\n</li>\n<li>Heavy impact on performance and accuracy of the platform.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Low:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaining small amounts of low sensitivity data </li>\n<li>Slight impact on performance and accuracy of the platform</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Exploitability</strong>\n<p>Exploitability refers to the difficulty the system can be \u201cgamed\u201d or security measures can be bypassed.\n</p>\n<strong>Examples:</strong>\n<p>\n<em>Critical:</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vulnerabilities can be easily exploited without any significant roadblock </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities can be exploited without any special requirements like complicated hardware or software.\n</li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities which can be seen as an immediate threat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<em>Low:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exploits which are very difficult due to complicated or heavy requirements e.g.\ncomplicated hardware or software requirements.\nheavy guessing of unknown values (brute force) or </li>\n<li>Exploits with a large uncertainty of success </li>\n<li>Vulnerabilities which can be seen as improvements and no immediate threat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please note that all these examples refer to unauthorized actions and not the normal intended functions (e.g.\ndata export, normal trading function) by Bitpanda.\n</p>\n<strong>Severity</strong>\n<p>Severity is used for calculating the reward and is a combination of impact and exploitability.\n</p>\n<p>The formula can be seen as: </p>\n<p>\n<em>Impact (Damage) * Exploitability (How easy is it to repeat the damage) = Vulnerability Tier</em>\n</p>\n<strong>Examples:</strong>\n<p>\n<em>Critical:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy accessible vulnerability without any major obstacle (critical exploitability) causing a major compromise (critical impact).\n</li>\n<li>Easy accessible vulnerability (critical exploitability) causing irreversible damage to Bitpanda or its users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Low:</em>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No immediate threat (low exploitability) not heavily impacting the integrity of the system (low impact).\n</li>\n<li>Attack with high requirement and high uncertainty of success (low exploitability) causing a slight effect on the accuracy or performance of the system (low impact).</li>\n</ul>",

(hereinafter referred to as \u201c<strong>device</strong>\u201d) when you visit our website.\nSuch files allow us to record certain pieces of information whenever you interact with our website, services (newsletter) and applications.\nWe use most of them to optimise the performance of our website as well as to improve our platform, products and services continuously.\nCookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise your devices.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>There are many specific types of cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies that are used, and their names may change from time to time.\nIn order to help you better understand cookies and their functions as well as our use of such technologies, we would like to explain this to you hereafter in more detail.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>The term cookie or tracking tool describes many different technologies, for example the following: </p>\n<p>\n<br>session and persistent cookies.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>flash and HTML 5 cookies.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>JavaScript Snippets.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>web beacons or gifs (also called ClearGIFs, tracking pixels or pixel tags, Skript, Page Tags).\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>other device identifiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>additional analytic tools without direct cookie settings.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>In this Cookie Policy, we will use the term \u201c<strong>cookie</strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>similar technologies</strong>\u201d to cover all kinds of such technologies.\nWe will provide you with necessary details regarding special cookies and how you can change your settings regarding these technologies.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>All about cookies:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Which types of cookies exist and what are the purposes of cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Types of cookies:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Session cookies:</strong> these are temporary cookie files, which are only active for the browser session and are thus erased after you close your browser (\u201c<strong>session cookies</strong>\u201d).\nThe next time you visit that website, it will not recognise you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Persistent cookies:</strong> these are files which are stored for a longer period in your browser\u2019s subfolders until you delete them manually or your browser deletes them after a period contained within the persistent cookie\u2019s file (\u201c<strong>persistent cookies</strong>\u201d).\nUsually the storage time for persistent cookies is between 30 days and a maximum 2 year (this does not necessarily apply to third party cookies, please see 11).\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>First-party cookies:</strong> these are cookies stored directly by the website that you are visiting, e.g.\nby us or by an assigned third party (\u201c<strong>first-party cookies</strong>\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Third-party cookies:</strong> these are cookies that are set by a party other than the website you are visiting, so a third party sets this cookie through this website (\u201c<strong>third-party cookies</strong>\u201d).\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Cookie ID:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>Cookies might contain what is known as a cookie ID.\nA cookie ID is a unique identifier for the cookie.\nIt consists of a string of characters that websites and servers associate with the specific internet browser in which the cookie was stored.\nThis allows websites to distinguish your own individual browser from other internet browsers that contain other cookies.\nA specific internet browser can be recognised and identified via the unique cookie ID.\nHowever, a person cannot be identified via such cookies (there may be exceptions for special tools of third parties, please see 11).\nRegardless, there are also cookies without a cookie ID, like most session cookies.\nFurthermore, some tools might recognise visitors via device fingerprinting and similar technologies.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Categories and purposes of cookies:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>Cookies have many different purposes and we use them for many important functions on our website.\nThis is why we would like to explain those categories, as well as the purposes and functions to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Essential cookies:</strong> such cookies can be session or persistent cookies and they are necessary to provide our services to you.\nSuch cookies and similar technologies are essential to enable our websites to display the settings you have made and navigate the website correctly.\nFurthermore, we use such cookies for security reasons as well as for the general performance of our services and to offer our products (e.g.\nAffiliate programme and Tell-a-Friend programme).\nThey are usually set to adapt to how you use our website before and after the login, equivalent to a client request.\nThese cookies make it possible to remember your privacy and language settings, if you are logged into your account together with other customisations.\nFor example, you as the user of a website do not need to enter your login details on each visit to the website, because this is handled by the website and by the cookie stored in your browser.\nRegarding security matters, such technologies help us with the identification and examination of potentially defective or suspicious access to our websites, user accounts and our network (e.g.\nprevention of identity theft, bot attacks, fraud, etc.).\nWith such technologies, we can also detect technical issues on our website (e.g.\ncrash reports).\nEssential cookies will be provided by us or by a third party whose services are implemented by us on our website (e.g.\nreCHAPTCHA, Sentry, Sift Science).\nIf you block these cookies via your browser, our services cannot be provided to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Performance cookies:</strong> these cookies and similar technologies (analytic tools) are used to collect information about the visitors of our website (number, frequency, preferences, etc.) and how visitors use our website, so that we can measure and improve the performance of our website, including our services.\nThey also help us to know which pages and parts of our platform are the most popular or unpopular and how visitors move around the website.\nThis helps us improve the way our site works as well as the general user experience.\nAlso, web analytic tools might use cookies to enhance the performance of the website.\nSuch cookies can be session or persistent cookies.\nAll information collected by these cookies is aggregated and therefore kept anonymous for us (this does not necessarily apply to third parties, please see 11).\nThese cookies will be provided by us or by a third party whose services are implemented on our sites.\nBlocking such cookies and tools via your browser or opting-out has no effect on the services provided to you.\nHowever, it makes it harder for us to further improve the user experience that our customers appreciate so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Advertisement cookies:</strong> mostly, such cookies are persistent cookies from third party tools which are implemented on our website.\nAmong other uses, such cookies allow us to deliver advertisement more relevant to you and your interests (customised advertising).\nWe can also track our marketing campaigns with such tools (e.g.\nconversion tracking).\nFurthermore, they can limit the number of times you see an ad and generally they make advertising more relevant to you.\nSuch cookies might collect information about you and your browsing habits, like the pages you have visited and the links you have followed.\nAdvertising networks very often set such cookies with the permission of the website operator, whereby they can be linked directly to the websites of such companies.\nThus, such third parties may be able to track your browser across other websites and create a profile with your interests.\nespecially if you are logged into your social media accounts while surfing.\nThis can also affect the content you see on other websites you visit.\nSuch advertising tools also allow us to deliver ads to people on other websites or in social media who have previously visited our website (also \u201cretargeting\u201d).\nAll information collected by these tools is aggregated and therefore kept anonymous for us (this does not necessarily apply to third parties, please see 11).\nBlocking these cookies via your browser or the opt-out has no effect on the services offered to you.\nHowever, you will still see ads, but they won't be personalised for you and therefore less relevant for you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Other tracking technologies:</strong> Files or code like, e.g.\npixel, scripts, web beacons, gifs or page tags, might be implemented in emails (e.g.\nnewsletter), applications or in ads, to record your interaction with us, so that we can better analyse and improve our services and campaigns.\nYou can generally block such technologies by adjusting either your browser or device settings (please see 9).\nAs long as you use the browser, these settings should apply to all technologies, whether they are on a website or in an email.\nHowever, in some cases, depending on your email or browser settings, the files might be automatically accepted.\nBlocking such cookies and similar technologies does not affect the service offered to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mobile App Tracking:</strong> When you use our Mobile App, we might record information that is unique to you and associated with your device (such as operating system, IP-address, browser type, device type, unique device identification number), your activities within the app, and your network location.\nThis information is used to measure and improve the performance and usability of the Mobile App.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>&nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Personal

transfer your personal data only to the extent described below or within the scope of an instruction at the time the data is collected from you.\nIn addition, personal data that we collect concerning you will neither be sold by us nor otherwise disclosed to third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.1 Data transfer within the Bitpanda Group:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As part of the Bitpanda Group we might transmit data to a limited extent within the Bitpanda Group.\nThis happens for internal administrative purposes to conduct internal administrative activities efficiently in a shared way or if a company of Bitpanda Group acts as service provider (processor) for Bitpanda Payments.\nIn all these cases only those offices or employees will receive your personal data who need it to fulfil the contractual and legal obligations and legitimate interests.\nHowever, no sensitive payment data will be transmitted within the Bitpanda Group.\nIf a company acts as a service provider for Bitpanda Payments, we contractually oblige this company to ensure the confidentiality and security of your personal data that they process on our behalf.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.2 Data transfer to processors:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To a limited extent, we also transmit personal information to processors who perform services for us such as video authentication services (e.g.\nIDnow GmbH, youniqx Identity AG), IT services (Amazon Web Services Inc.), Client support (Zendesk Inc.), performance of contracts, account management, accounting, invoicing, and examination of defective or suspicious business cases (Sift Science Inc).\nProcessors may only use or disclose this data to the extent necessary to perform services for us or to comply with legal rules.\nWe contractually oblige these processors to ensure the confidentiality and security of your personal data that they process on our behalf.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.3 Data transfer to public bodies and institutions:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We might also transfer your personal data (i) if we are required to do so by law or in the context of legal proceedings, (ii) if we believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent damages or financial loss, or (iii) in connection with an investigation into suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activities.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.4 Data transfer to other third parties:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Joint Controllership:</strong> If Bitpanda Payments acts together with other parties as joint controller (e.g.\nprocessing data for jointly determined purposes within the Bitpanda Group), we provide those parties with personal data if applicable and based on at least one of the legal bases listed above under Point 9.\nIn case of a joint controllership, we transmit your personal data only based on a sufficient agreement with our partners (Art 26 GDPR).\nHowever, no sensitive payment data will be transmitted within the Bitpanda Group.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other third parties:</strong> Bitpanda Payments might transfer your personal data to any other person with your consent to the disclosure or the purpose of performing a contract or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract, especially for the performance of payment services to credit institutions and other payment service providers as well as in regard of Bitpanda GmbH and/or Bitpanda Metals GmbH, as far as the disclosure is necessary for the performance of transactions of cryptocurrencies, digital assets or the purchase and sale of precious metals.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nInternational data transfer:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Is data transferred to third countries or international organisations?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your personal data might be accessed by staff or suppliers in, transferred to, and/or stored at, a destination outside the country in which you are located, whose data protection laws might be of a lower standard than those in the European Union.\nHowever, Bitpanda Payments will in all circumstances, safeguard personal data as set out in this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n<p>If we process personal data in a third country (outside the European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area [EEA]) or if this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services or disclosure and/or transfer of personal data to third parties, we shall only transfer personal data to the performance of our (pre)contractual obligations, based on your consent, a legal obligation or our legitimate interests.\nSubject to legal or contractual authorisations, we process or have personal data processed in a third country only where the conditions of Art 44 et seq GDPR are met.\nThis means, for example, that processing and transferring is carried out based on special safeguards, such as the officially recognised setting of adequate level of data protection corresponding to the EU (e.g.\nfor the USA by the EU/US Privacy Shield) or compliance with officially recognised special contractual obligations (known as \u201cStandard Contractual Clauses\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>Please contact privacy@bitpanda.com if you need further information regarding the international data transfer or if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nRetention and deletion periods:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>For how long is my personal data processed (stored) and when will it be deleted?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain your personal data, as far as necessary, for the duration of the entire business relationship (from initiation through performance to termination of a contract), and in principal, 1 year after termination of the business relationship.\nBeyond this we retain your data only for a longer period, in accordance with statutory retention and documentation obligations or to defend legal claims.\nWhen we perform payment initiation services for you, we will not store the sensitive payment data obtained thereby.\n</p>\n<p>The retention period is thus determined by the statutory retention periods or limitation periods.\nIn accordance with the Austrian Enterprise Code (UGB) and the Federal Tax Code (BAO) 7 years, in accordance with the Financial Market Money Laundering Act (FM-GWG) and the Payment Service Provider Act (ZaDiG 2018) 5 years, in accordance with the Equal Treatment Act (GIBG) half a year and in certain cases between 3 and 30 years according to the Austrian General Civil Code (ABGB) e.g.\nif data are required as evidence for legal disputes or for as long as there are other legitimate interests in retention.\n</p>\n<p>Unless expressly stated in this Privacy Policy, personal data processed by us shall be erased as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and the erasure does not conflict with any statutory retention obligations.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nData subject rights:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What rights and options under GDPR do I have?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to request confirmation from us as to whether we are processing personal data concerning you.\nWhere personal data

it was collected.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>you withdraw your consent on which the processing was based and where there is no other legal basis or overriding legitimate interest for the processing.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the personal data has been unlawfully processed.\nor </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>erasure of the personal data is required for compliance with a legal obligation under European Union or Member State law to which the Controller is subject.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Requests for the erasure of personal data must include the respective ground (Art 17 para 1 GDPR).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong> You have the right to request from us the restriction of processing where one of the following conditions applies: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>you contest the accuracy of the personal data (the restriction shall be put in place for a period which enables Bitpanda Payments to verify the accuracy of the personal data).\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>the processing of your personal data was unlawful, and you oppose the erasure of your personal data and request instead the restriction of their use.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bitpanda Payments no longer requires your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but you require them for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nor </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have objected to processing your personal data and it has not yet been determined whether the legitimate grounds of Bitpanda Payments override your own.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nYou shall also have the right to request that we transfer this data directly to another controller, designated by you, where this is technically feasible and does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\nThe right to data portability may only be exercised where the basis of the processing is either your consent or a (pre)contractual necessity, and where the processing is carried out by automated means.\nThe right to data portability does not apply to processing which is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Right to object:</strong> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time if the processing is based on our legitimate interests.\nIf you have objected to processing, we shall no longer process your personal data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or unless the processing is for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims.\nThe objection does not affect the lawfulness of processing your personal data based on legitimate interests before your withdrawal.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contact:</strong> To exercise one of the above-mentioned rights, you can send an email to privacy@bitpanda.com or a letter to Bitpanda Payments GmbH, Campus 2, Jakov-Lind-Stra\u00dfe 2, 1020 Vienna, Austria.\nPlease note that for such requests we require further identification data from

if you want to generally object to the processing of your data for advertising purposes.\nThe objection does not affect the lawfulness of processing your personal data based on legitimate interests before your withdrawal.\n</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind, however, that such an objection will only be made to Bitpanda Group and that even after such an objection, you might still receive advertising about Bitpanda from other providers on other websites over which we have no control.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>15.\nAutomated decision-making:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Bitpanda Payments use my personal data for automated decision-making including profiling?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Bitpanda Payments does not use personal data for automated decision-making including profiling within the meaning of Art 22 GDPR (e.g.\ndecisions producing legal effects concerning data subjects, or otherwise significantly affecting them, based solely on automated processing of personal data, including profiling).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>16.\nProcessing for other purposes:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Is my personal data processed for purposes other than those for which the personal data was collected?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As a general principle of Bitpanda Payments, we only process personal data for the purposes for which they were collected.\nIn exceptional cases, however, we might process your personal data which we have collected for one specific purpose for another purpose.\nIn this case, we will inform you before the intended processing about this purpose, the period for which your personal data will be stored, the exercise of data subject rights, the option to withdraw consent, the existence of the right to file a complaint with the data protection authority, whether
