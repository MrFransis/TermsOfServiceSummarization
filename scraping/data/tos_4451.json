information, please contact us at privacy@yieldlift.com.</p>\n<p>This policy describes what YieldLift does, the data that it processes on behalf of its advertising and publishing partners, and data sharing options you may have with regard to your personal data.\nThis policy applies to all information that passes through our services.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand how personal information is processed by YieldLift.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Our privacy policy is organized into the following

websites, apps and advertisers to market, sell and buy digital ad space.\nYieldLift helps demand side platforms, advertising agencies and brands (\u201cDemand Partners\u201d) buy digital ad space and helps ad networks, website and app publishers (\u201cPublishers\u201d) generate revenue by selling available ad space.\nThe decision to sell or purchase ad space between Publishers and Demand Partners happens through an automated, software-based process called \"real-time bidding\" where multiple advertisers bid on places to show their ads.\nOur technology supports real-time bidding.</p>\n<p>The entities that work with YieldLift may have their own policies that govern how they collect, use, and share data, and may differ from YieldLift\u2019s policies.\nBelow we\u2019ve listed the entities we work with (with links to their privacy policies) as of the date indicated at the top of this notice.\nPlease review these policies, and those of the websites and apps you visit and use, to become familiar with their data practices and to learn about any data collection, sharing and use choices that you may have.</p>\n<p> 33Across <br> AdaptMX <br> EMX <br> Google AdExchange <br> Google AdSense
