marketing campaign effectiveness, recognize certain types of information on your computer, in your e-mail or on your mobile device, such as the time and date you viewed a page, which e-mails are opened, which links are clicked, and similar information.\nAmong other things, we collect this information to improve our Services and your experience, to see which areas and features of our Services are popular and to count visits, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests and to analyze trends, to administer our Services, to track users\u2019 movements around our Services, to

new ways to collect and use information.\nWe often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information.\nFurthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may

privacy policies from time to time.</p> 2.2.\nUSER SHARED INFORMATION <p>In addition to automatically collected information, some of our Services ask users to share additional information.\nWe collect user shared information when you visit or use our websites or services, or interact with any advertising on our websites or services.\nSome of the ways we do this are described below: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>At www.recargo.com, users can access limited features of the website without disclosing their personal information.\nHowever, if users choose to contact us regarding Recargo, its

the enhanced capabilities of the website, we will collect the user\u2019s personal information, including e-mail address, zip code or other location information, and any biographical information the user wishes to share with the community.</li>\n<li>At www.pluginsights.com, we offer surveys through which users may share with Recargo various types of information about their personal

using the contact information below.</p> 3.\nHOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES <p>Recargo may disclose personal information in the following circumstances:</p> 3.1.\nBUSINESS PARTNERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS <p>Recargo shares personal information with business partners and subcontractors, including without limitation, affiliates, vendors, service providers and suppliers.\nThese third parties assist us in our business including maintaining our Services, referring customers to us, developing and improving products, facilitating the processing of payments, communicating with you about issues with our Services, marketing, and in connection with any contract we have with an individual or entity or to accomplish a legitimate business need.\nIf the business is a vendor or service provider to us, the business is only authorized to use your personal information as necessary to comply with our contractual agreements and not for secondary purposes unless the data has been anonymized.</p> 3.2.\nTHIRD PARTY ANALYTICS PROVIDERS <p>Recargo shares personal information with third parties who conduct marketing studies and data analytics, including those that provide tools or code which facilitates our review and management of our Services, such as Google Analytics or similar software products from other providers.\nFor example, we use Google Analytics to analyze usage of

Analytics information with information about visits to multiple sites.\nWe may use these tracking technologies to provide tailored advertising and evaluate our marketing efforts.\nFor more information about how Google collects and processes data when you visit websites or use apps that use Google technologies, please see \u201cHow Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps\u201d at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.</p> 3.3.\nBUSINESS TRANSFERS OR BANKRUPTCY <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets, personal information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third parties.\nWe reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction, to transfer or assign your personal information and other information we have collected from the users of our websites or services, or individuals who provide us personal information under this Policy, to third parties.\nOther than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, or as otherwise agreed to by you, the use and disclosure of all transferred personal information will be subject to this Policy.\nHowever,

ORDERS.\nPROTECTION OF OUR RIGHTS.\nSAFETY <p>Recargo shares personal information as required or permitted by law, regulation, legal process or other legal requirement, or when we believe in our sole discretion that disclosure is necessary or appropriate, to respond to an emergency or to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, comply with a judicial proceeding or subpoenas, court order, law-enforcement or government request, including without limitation to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or other legal process and to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use.</p> 3.5.\nPUBLICLY POSTED CONTENT <p>If you post comments, images, and other content to a public-facing page, that personal information (associated with your account) will be publicly viewable.\nSuch pages can include collaboration information that may be searchable by search engines like Google.</p> 3.6.\nYOUR CONSENT <p>We may share some or all of your personal information to any other third party with your affirmative consent.</p> 3.7.\nANONYMIZED DATA <p>Recargo may share personal information that has been anonymized in a manner so that it is no longer considered personal information by applicable laws and regulations.</p> 4.\n\u201cDO NOT TRACK REQUESTS\u201d <p>Do Not Track: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\u201cDNT\u201d) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many website operators, including Recargo, do not respond to DNT signals.</p> 5.\nRECARGO

either negotiated an agreement to use the Recargo platform technology or have agreed to our self-service Application Programming Interfaces (\u201cAPI\u201d) and Plugin terms in order to build applications (\u201cPlatform Applications\u201d).\nBoth the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to Recargo.\nIf you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third party developer.\nTo revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your settings.\nNote, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be
