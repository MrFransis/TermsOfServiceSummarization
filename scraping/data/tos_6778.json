all claims by third parties due to the infringement of rights based on the content or parts thereof published by the customer on the Internet or transferred to easyfeedback for publication.\nThis includes, in particular, the obligation to indemnify or hold harmless easyfeedback and/or employees of easyfeedback from claims for damages or reimbursement of expenses by third parties as well as

purposes.\nCommercial use, in particular resale as a service (software as a service), is not permitted.\nThe company\u2019s own marketing as a provider of online surveys with easyfeedback as a software solution is also not permitted with the services offered (survey rates) at https://easy-feedback.com.\nAdditional terms and conditions and a separate license agreement are required for this.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 6 Confidentiality, Data Protection and Storage<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) In accordance with Art.\n14 GDPR, easyfeedback points out that personal data is stored.\nIf necessary and unless the customer expressly objects, this data may be disclosed to third parties exclusively for the purpose of processing the contract.\nThe customer has the right to revoke its consent to this storage and use of its personal data at any time with effect for the future.</p>\n<p>(2) easyfeedback undertakes not to use the data collected during the surveys or the survey results of the customer in any way or to make them available to third parties.</p>\n<p>(3) The above paragraphs (1) and (2) only do not apply insofar as easyfeedback is legally obligated to disclose such data to third parties, in particular to government agencies, for example for criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p>(4) The customer agrees that he/she may be named by easyfeedback in written and electronic form as a reference customer with his/her company name.\nUpon special request, the customer may object to this by sending a simple email and request immediate removal of the reference customer name.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 7 Data Backup, Deletion of Questionnaires and User Accounts<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) Data backups are performed by easyfeedback every 24 hours and are always considered to be up-to-date within the next 24 hours.\nA failure of the data backup due to viruses or hacker attacks or other circumstances not caused by gross negligence or intent on the part of easyfeedback does not give rise to any claims by the customer against easyfeedback.</p>\n<p>(2) The customer must back up the data collected from its questionnaires or the results of its surveys at regular intervals using a CSV export.\nThe customer must take any necessary protective measures itself.</p>\n<p>(3) easyfeedback expressly points out that upon deletion of a questionnaire as well as a user subordinate to the customer, the associated data will be permanently deleted from the system.</p>\n<p>(4) If the customer has not requested a renewal within 6 months of the contract term, easyfeedback is entitled to permanently and irrevocably delete all of the customer\u2019s data, including all users, questionnaires and survey results in its user account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 8 Availability and Guarantee of the Service<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) easyfeedback strives for 100% availability of the service.\nThis does not include times when the web server is unavailable due to technical or other problems that are beyond the control of easyfeedback, such as in the event of force majeure, fault of third parties, etc.\nIn the event of attacks, easyfeedback may suspend the service for the duration of the attack.\nIn the event of disruptions or interruptions, easyfeedback will immediately take all reasonable measures to restore availability as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p>(2) easyfeedback guarantees that the service will essentially fulfill its main functions.\nThe warranty does not cover damages and/or disruptions caused by the customer violating the provisions of this agreement.\nIf there is a defect in the service, easyfeedback is initially entitled to supplementary performance.\nIn the event that the subsequent performance fails at least twice, the customer is entitled to reduce the price or to withdraw from the contract at its discretion.</p>\n<p>The warranty obligation is limited in time to the term of the respective contract.</p>\n<p>(3) The customer and easyfeedback agree that the state of the art does not allow software to be created in such a way that it is free of errors for all application conditions.\nThe customer will immediately notify easyfeedback of any errors in writing and specify the defects in detail.\nAt easyfeedback\u2019s request, the customer will also provide the data used by easyfeedback that led to the error as well as the cooperation required to analyze and correct the error in an appropriate manner and free of charge for the purpose of processing the contract.</p>\n<p>(4) If expenses are incurred due to notices of defects that are not based on defects in the service provided by easyfeedback, the customer will reimburse easyfeedback for the costs incurred.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 9 Liability</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) easyfeedback has unlimited liability for damages caused intentionally or through gross negligence by employees, legal representatives or vicarious agents in accordance with the statutory provisions.\nThe same applies to damages resulting from injury to life, limb or health.<br>Insofar as easyfeedback is not liable due to an assumed guarantee, liability for damages caused by employees, legal representatives or vicarious agents due to slight negligence only applies insofar as these are based on the breach of material contractual obligations (cardinal obligations).\nCardinal obligations are contractual obligations the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper performance of the contract and on the fulfillment of which the contractual partner could rely.\nIf liability for simple negligence applies, liability is limited to compensation for the damage typically foreseeable for easyfeedback at the time the contract was concluded.\nInsofar as the liability of easyfeedback is excluded or limited, this exclusion or limitation also applies to the personal liability of employees, legal representatives or vicarious agents of easyfeedback.</p>\n<p>(2) Compensation for the foreseeable and typical damage in accordance with paragraph (1) generally consists of providing the respective services to the customer again free of charge.</p>\n<p>(3) easyfeedback is not liable for ensuring that the questionnaire designed by the customer is suitable for the purpose intended by the customer.\nNor is easyfeedback liable for the survey achieving the success desired by the customer or the number of survey participants desired by the customer.</p>\n<p>(4) If a case of force majeure occurs, easyfeedback is not responsible for the resulting delay or impossibility of the services.\nForce majeure is defined as all unforeseeable events or events that \u2013 even if they were foreseeable \u2013 are beyond the control of easyfeedback and whose effects on the fulfillment of the contract cannot be prevented by the reasonable efforts of both parties to the contract.</p>\n<p>(5) The customer shall indemnify easyfeedback against all claims asserted against easyfeedback by third parties due to the infringement of their rights or due to legal violations resulting from the illegal or improper use of the service.\nIn this regard, the customer also assumes the costs of legal defense, in particular all attorney\u2019s fees and court costs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 10 Notice of Termination by easyfeedback<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) The right of easyfeedback to terminate the contract for good cause remains unaffected.</p>\n<p>(2) Terminations must be made in writing to be effective.</p>\n<p>(3) Active disruptions or threats to the service due to actions by the user will result in immediate termination without notice.\nIn this case, easyfeedback reserves the right to assert claims for damages against the user.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 11 Right of Withdrawal<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(1) Consumers (private individuals and students) as defined by \u00a7 13 BGB (German Civil Code) have the right to revoke their ordered survey tariff within two weeks of the conclusion of the contract without further ado.\nThe deadline for compliance is 14 days and begins with the conclusion of the contract (timestamp of the order of the survey tariff on the easyfeedback server).\nThe timely dispatch of the revocation in text form (letter, fax, email, etc.) is sufficient to comply with the withdrawal period.\nThe withdrawal must be sent to: support@easy-feedback.com or fax to + 49 \u2013 261 \u2013 960 987 50.</p>\n<p>(2) If the customer (consumer) has already used easyfeedback by publishing a survey and/or recording participant results, the right of revocation expires.\nIn the event of an effective revocation, easyfeedback will reimburse the customer (consumer) for any payments already made.</p>\n<p>(3) Any revocation must be made in writing in order to be effective.\nThis also applies as an email or fax.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 12 Business

Federal Republic of Germany shall apply to the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).</p>\n<p>(2) The place of performance and jurisdiction in relation to merchants, legal entities under public law or special funds under public law shall be Koblenz.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 14 Written Form<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>All amendments and additions to these GTC must be made in writing to be effective.\nThe waiver of the written form requirement must also be in writing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\u00a7 15 Language</strong>\n</p>\n<p>These General Terms and Conditions are originally written in German.\nIf the translated version differs from the German, the German version shall apply in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>November 1st,

processed in order to display them in the \u201conline meeting\u201d and, if necessary, to record them.\nIn order to enable the display of video and the playback of audio, the data from the microphone of your terminal device and any video camera on the terminal device are processed accordingly for the duration of the meeting.\nYou can switch off or mute the camera or microphone yourself at any time using the \u201cZoom\u201d applications.</p>\n<p>In order to take part in an \u201conline meeting\u201d or to enter the \u201cmeeting room\u201d, you must at least provide information about your name.</p>\n<p>Scope of processing<br>We use \u201cZoom\u201d to conduct \u201conline meetings\u201d.\nIf we want to record \u201conline meetings\u201d, we will inform you transparently in advance and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 ask for your consent.\nThe fact of the recording is also displayed in the \u201cZoom\u201d app.</p>\n<p>If necessary for the purpose of logging the results of an online meeting, we will log the chat content.\nHowever, this will usually not be the case.</p>\n<p>In the case of webinars, we can also process the questions asked by webinar participants for the purpose of recording and following up webinars.</p>\n<p>If you are registered as a user with \u201cZoom\u201d, reports on \u201cOnline Meetings\u201d (meeting metadata, data on dialing in, questions and answers in webinars, survey function in webinars) can be saved in \u201cZoom\u201d for up to one month.</p>\n<p>Automated decision-making within the meaning of Art.\n22 GDPR is not used.</p>\n<p>Legal basis for data processing<br>Insofar as personal data is processed by employees of Mustermann GmbH, Section 26 BDSG is the legal basis for data processing.\nIf, in connection with the use of \u201cZoom\u201d, personal data are not required for the establishment, implementation or termination of the employment relationship, but are nevertheless an elementary component when using \u201cZoom\u201d, Article 6 (1) lit.\nf) GDPR is applicable the legal basis for data processing.\nIn these cases, we are interested in the effective implementation of \u201conline meetings\u201d.<br>In addition, the legal basis for data processing when conducting \u201conline meetings\u201d is Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR, insofar as the meetings are held in the context of contractual relationships.<br>If there is no contractual relationship, the legal basis is Art.\n6 Paragraph 1 lit.\nf) GDPR.\nHere, too, we are interested in the effective implementation of \u201conline meetings\u201d.</p>\n<p>Recipient / transfer of data<br>Personal data that are processed in connection with participation in \u201conline meetings\u201d are generally not passed on to third parties unless they are specifically intended to be passed on.\nPlease note that content from \u201conline meetings\u201d, as well as from personal meeting meetings, is often used to communicate information with customers, interested parties or third parties and is therefore intended to be passed on.<br>Other recipients: The provider of \u201cZoom\u201d necessarily receives knowledge of the above data, insofar as this is provided for in our order processing contract with \u201cZoom\u201d.</p>\n<p>Data processing outside the European Union<br>\u201cZoom\u201d is a service that is provided by a provider from the USA.\nProcessing of personal data also takes place in a third country.\nWe have concluded an order processing contract with the provider of \u201cZoom\u201d which meets the requirements of Art.\n28 GDPR.<br>On the one hand, an adequate level of data protection is guaranteed by the conclusion of the so-called EU standard contractual clauses.\nAs a supplementary protective measure, we have also made our zoom configuration so that only data centers in the EU, the EEA or secure third countries such as Canada or Japan are used for the implementation of \u201conline meetings\u201d.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Stripe</b>\n</p>\n<p>On our website we offer, among other things, payment via Stripe and the associated payment methods.\nThe provider of these payment services
