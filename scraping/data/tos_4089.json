protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Services and other users of our Services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition, we may provide non-personally identifiable information (i.e.\n<em>not</em> your Personal Information) relating to your

GDPR (i.e., data that can be traced back to you as an individual), and we are therefore required to justify why we are lawfully permitted to process this data.\nSimply put, we collect and process the data that you give us (your email address, your shopping lists, your recipes) in order to provide you with a multi-user shopping list app.\nDoing so is the core purpose of our Services.\nWe therefore have a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (as defined by the GDPR) in processing this data (see Article&nbsp;6, paragraph&nbsp;1(f)).\nWe do not process personal data that is incidental to the Services (such as your demographic data).\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have questions about our GDPR compliance.</p> Changes To This Privacy Policy <p>If we make a material change to this privacy policy, we will notify you by email or within the OurGroceries apps so that you may review the new terms and decide whether to continue using the Services.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and share information.</p> Contacting Us <p>If you have questions or comments about this privacy policy, please contact us at
