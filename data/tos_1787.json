Product.\nHowever, if you are an employee or health plan member who has enabled access to your health record at WebMD.com by registering at your employer's or health plan's website, the privacy policy applicable to your information at your employer's or health plan's website remains applicable to your personal health record at WebMD.com.\nIf your employer or health plan account is no longer made

Policy.</p>\n<p>Except where noted, statements in this Privacy Policy with respect to the WebMD Sites also apply to the Apps.\nIf you do not want us to collect, use or disclose information about you and your use of the Services as described in this Privacy Policy, then you should not use the Services.\nBy using the Services, you must agree to the WebMD Terms of Use, which is the contract between us and users of the Services.\n&nbsp;By accepting the WebMD Terms of Use, you confirm that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and the WebMD Cookie Policy and you acknowledge that we will

Privacy Policy is always protected under the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;Except as otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy, WebMD LLC is the data controller responsible for the processing of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;WebMD LLC has appointed Aptus Health International France SAS, 5 place de la Pyramide, Tour Ariane, 92800 Puteaux, FRANCE, (\"Aptus

information, while others (such as WebMD Lab Testing and the Ovulation/Pregnancy Calendar and the Healthy Target Program in the WebMD App and certain of our registration-only Apps like WebMD Baby, WebMD Pregnancy and WebMD Allergy) store your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nEven if you do not register with or provide any personal information to WebMD, we collect information about your use of the WebMD Sites and Apps and the Services.\nWe may also acquire information about our users from external sources.</p>\n<p>When you use the Services, we collect information as follows:</p> Registration <p>While you may use most of the Services without registering, certain Services do require that you register with WebMD for them to function properly.\nIf you choose to register or update an existing account with WebMD or access certain Services, you may be required to provide certain personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number, gender, email address and date of birth, and a username and password to access your WebMD account.\nYou are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personal information that you submit to WebMD.</p> Interactive Services <p>Some of our Services, such as WebMD Symptom Checker, are interactive and may request that you submit health-related information, along with other information such as your age and gender.&nbsp;You are not required to register with WebMD to use WebMD Symptom Checker and if you are registered with WebMD, we do not associate information that you submit to the Symptom

eligible to participate in WebMD Lab Testing, a service powered by PWNHealth, which enables you to place a secure online order for certain lab tests.\nOnce you\u2019ve ordered your test, you\u2019ll visit a designated testing center where an experienced lab technician will collect your samples.\nWebMD has selected PWNHealth to provide care coordination (including independent physician review of test orders) and other administrative services (including processing credit card payments for the lab test orders).\nOrdering a lab test with WebMD Lab Testing requires you to register with WebMD.\nWebMD will share the personal information you use to register with WebMD with PWNHealth for purposes of processing and administering your lab test order.\nYou will be able to access your lab test orders and results from PWNHealth through your WebMD account but WebMD will never receive your lab test results or your payment information.\nOnly PWNHealth will have access to this information.\nPWNHealth may disclose to WebMD certain personal information in the aggregate which does not identify you.\nPWNHealth will use your personal information and other information it collects about you in providing the WebMD Lab Testing services in accordance with its privacy policy available here and terms of use available here.\nWhen you interact with WebMD Lab Testing you may interact with certain website pages that are hosted by WebMD or by PWNHealth.\nThis Privacy Policy describes what information WebMD collects about you when you use WebMD\u2019s Services and how that information is used, disclosed, and maintained by WebMD.\nPWNHealth\u2019s privacy policy and terms of use will appear on any website page that is hosted by PWNHealth.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy only applies to the WebMD Site pages hosted by WebMD.\nWebMD and PWNHealth will use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect&nbsp;information about your usage of WebMD Lab Testing, including which lab tests you have viewed and to statistically analyze trends and other user behavior on the WebMD Lab Testing pages.\nOther than PWNHealth, WebMD does not allow any third parties to gather any data about you in connection with your purchase of a lab test through WebMD Lab Testing including through the use of cookies or other tracking technologies.\nFurthermore, WebMD does not use any personal information that you submit in connection with WebMD Lab Testing to deliver any advertisements to you on or off of the WebMD&nbsp;Sites.</p> Email Newsletters <p>At registration and at various times as you use the WebMD Sites, you will be given the option of providing us with personal information in order to receive informational/promotional newsletters \u2013 such as a newsletter relating to a specific health condition \u2013 via email from WebMD and/or directly from third parties.\nFrom time to time WebMD may offer users of third party websites the opportunity to subscribe to our newsletters through those websites.\nIf you elect to subscribe to one of our newsletters on a third party website, the operator of that website will provide us with the personal information you have provided in connection with the subscription request, which we may use in accordance with this Privacy Policy as though you had provided it directly to WebMD.&nbsp;</p> Email a Friend <p>If you use our Email a Friend service to tell a friend about a feature on a WebMD&nbsp;Site&nbsp;or a newsletter, we will ask you for your name, your email address and your friend's email address.\nWe will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site using your name and email address as the \"from\" email address.\nWebMD does not use your friend's email information for any other purpose.\nWe will only use the information you provide to send the requested email to your friend.</p>\n<p>If you believe that one of your contacts has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please use the Contact Us link provided at the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites.</p> Market Research <p>From time to time, WebMD may conduct online research surveys on behalf of itself and third parties through email invitations, pop-up surveys and online focus groups.\nWhen participating in a survey, we may require you to provide your location, age and if there\u2019s a sweepstakes associated with the market research survey, your name and contact information for purposes of sweepstakes administration.\nThe information you submit in a survey may be used by WebMD for research and measurement purposes, as described below, including to measure the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.\nThe personal information you provide in connection with a sweepstakes entry will be used for the sole purpose of administering the sweepstakes and as required by applicable law.\nWe will not knowingly invite individuals who are under the age of 13 to participate in market research surveys.\nMarket research surveys conducted by or on behalf of

reviews.\nOur reviews feature in the Physician Directory and are open to the public and should not be considered private.</p>\n<p>Any information (including personal information) you share in any review, or other forum is by design open to the public and is not private.\nYou should think carefully before posting any personal information in any public forum.\nWhat you post can be seen, disclosed to or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes.\nAs with any public forum on any site, the information you post may also show up in third-party search engines.</p> Emails You Send to WebMD <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to information, content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to WebMD by email.\nIf you want to keep content or business information, ideas, concepts or inventions private or proprietary, do not send them in an email to WebMD.</p> Services and Device Information <p>When you access and use the Services, WebMD automatically collects and stores in its server logs information from your browser or mobile device such as your IP address or unique device identifier, browser information (including referring URL), your preferences and settings, cookies and information about the content you have viewed and actions taken

operating system information, advertising ID (which is a unique, user-resettable identification number for advertising associated with a mobile device) and App version and usage information.\nWhen enabled by you, we collect precise location information provided by your mobile device, which you may disable through the device settings.</p> Precise Geolocation Data <p>When enabled by you, we collect precise location information provided by your mobile device.\nWe do so to provide you more relevant content including advertising based on your location.\nYou may disable the collection and use of your location data through your device settings.\nTo change location settings on your device, please refer to your device\u2019s official knowledge base.</p> Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies <p>We and our partners use cookies to collect information about your use of the Services.\n\u201cCookies\u201d are small data files assigned to your browser when you visit a WebMD Site which enable recognition of your browser and collect and store information about your use of the Services, as described above.\nIn addition to cookies, we and our partners use other tracking technologies that collect information about your use of the Services, including mobile identifiers and \"web beacons\" which are small graphic files (sometimes called \u201cclear GIFs\u201d or \u201cweb pixels\u201d) embedded in a web page or email typically used to monitor activity and send relevant information back to a home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party).&nbsp;The information collected by such tracking technologies may be combined with other information that our partners have access to, including your name, email address and physical address, so that we can send you materials, either electronically or by direct mail, that may be of interest to you.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our advertising service partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about your use of the WebMD Sites, including content you have viewed.\nThese third parties may use this information to help WebMD deliver advertising on the WebMD Sites and on other third party websites based on your browsing activity on the WebMD Sites.\nWebMD may further tailor the advertising on the WebMD Sites and these other third party websites based on additional information to the extent known by WebMD or these third parties.\nTwo of the third parties that WebMD works with are Google and Facebook.\nIn addition to using the information it collects performing services for WebMD, Google may also use such information as described in its privacy policy.\nTo see how Google may use information collected through our use of the Google services on the WebMD Sites visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.&nbsp.\nWhile Facebook does not provide any personal information to WebMD, Facebook may use information that it has about you and that it collects performing services for WebMD (which may be associated with personal information that Facebook has about you) as described in its privacy policy available at&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy.</p>\n<p>To provide you with certain personalization and advertising services described herein, when you use our WebMD Sites, we may share information that we may collect from you, such as your email address (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our service provider, LiveRamp Inc.\nand its affiliates, which may in turn link demographic or interest-based information to your browser.\nTo opt out of this use, visit https://liveramp.com/opt_out/.</p>\n<p>We also work with third party ad networks to display advertising on our WebMD Sites and on third party websites.\nOur ad network vendors use technologies to collect information about your activities on the WebMD Sites and in our flagship WebMD App to provide you cookie-based targeted advertising on our WebMD Sites and on third party websites based upon your browsing activity and your interests.</p>\n<p>For more information about our how cookies and other tracking technologies are used in connection with the Services, please read our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>When you download and install one of our Apps onto your mobile device we assign a random number to your App installation.\nThis number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App.\nWe use this random number in a manner similar to our use of cookies as described in this Privacy Policy and in our Cookie Policy.\nUnlike cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser.\nTherefore the random number cannot be removed through settings.\nIf you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use cookies, please do not use the Apps.\nOur use of cookies and other tracking technologies on our mobile optimized sites and our flagship WebMD App are similar to our use on our desktop sites.\nYour choices to reject cookies, use the Network Advertising Initiative and the opt-out mechanism described below in the section \"Your Choices and Rights\" are available on our flagship WebMD App and on our mobile optimized sites.</p> Cross-Device Tracking <p>We and our service providers collect and store information about users' interactions with unaffiliated websites and applications that use our technologies, including cookies and similar tracking technologies.\nThis allows us to infer the presence of a common user or household behind multiple devices.\nWe do so in order to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide personalized advertising on each device that is inferred from the browsing patterns on all of the devices;</li>\n<li>detect and prevent fraud;</li>\n<li>allow users to use our service on one device and pick up seamlessly where they left off on another device;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>limit the number of times a user is shown the same advertisement, across known or inferred devices</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For information on your advertising choices and opt-out, please see the \"Your Choices and Rights\" section of this Privacy Notice.</p> How Information Collected About You Is Used <p>Information about your use of the Services may be used for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to provide, improve and create new Services,</li>\n<li>to respond to your inquiries and to send you administrative communications about the WebMD Sites and Services,</li>\n<li>to obtain your feedback about the WebMD Sites and Services,</li>\n<li>to send you secure electronic messages and personalized emails pertaining to your interests as inferred from your use of the Services, including news, announcements, reminders and opportunities from WebMD,</li>\n<li>to statistically analyze trends and user behavior and activity including how frequently areas of the WebMD Sites are visited, how the Services are being used and how many emails are received and opened,</li>\n<li>to provide you and people with similar demographic characteristics and interests with more relevant content including advertising both on and off the WebMD Sites and Apps,</li>\n<li>to offer lead generation services,</li>\n<li>to detect and defend against fraud and other threats to the Services and our users,&nbsp;</li>\n<li>to identify issues with the Services,</li>\n<li>to conduct research and measurement activities, including those described below, and</li>\n<li>to administer your account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, WebMD may use personal information about you for other purposes that are disclosed to you at the time we collect the information and/or with your consent.</p>\n<p>WebMD may combine your personal information and other information collected about your use of the Services, and also supplement with information from external sources for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.\nFor example, information that WebMD collects about you may be combined by WebMD with other information available to WebMD through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising or programs.\nThis information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic, geographic, personal interests, product purchase activity or other information.\nWe may report aggregate information, which is not able to be identified back to an individual user of the WebMD Sites, to our current or prospective advertisers and other business partners.</p> Sharing Your Information WebMD Subsidiaries and Corporate Affiliates <p>We may share your information with our subsidiaries, affiliates and companies acquired by or merged with us and our affiliates.\nIn the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale to, or merger with, another entity, or in the event of a sale of assets or a bankruptcy, WebMD reserves the right to transfer your personal information to the new party in control or the party acquiring assets.\nIn the event of such a change, your personal information will continue to be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless any changes to the Privacy Policy are made in accordance with the section below that discusses \u201cChanges to This Privacy Policy.\u201d</p> Companies and Contractors that Work with

services relating to technology, data analysis, research, email management and deployment, sweepstakes and contest administration, advertising and marketing and/or content.\nWebMD contractors sometimes have limited access to your information in the course of providing products or services to WebMD.\nWe contractually require that our contractors not use or disclose your information for any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for WebMD.</p> Third Party Advertisers and Third Party Websites <p>We may share information that we have about you, such as a cookie ID or IP address, with third party advertising service providers who may use this information, on our behalf, to help WebMD deliver advertising on the WebMD Sites as well as on third party websites, as further described in our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>Certain content, services and advertisements offered to you through the WebMD Sites are served on, or contain links to, websites hosted and operated by a company other than WebMD (\"Third Party Websites\").\nWebMD does not share your personal information with these Third Party Websites without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you disclose to these Third Party Websites once you access these Third Party Websites is not subject to this Privacy Policy.\nWebMD does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Websites.\nYou should review the privacy policy posted on the Third Party Website to understand how that Third Party Website collects and uses your information.\nWebMD makes an effort to make it obvious to you when you leave a WebMD Site and enter a Third Party Website, either by requiring you to click on a link or by notifying you on the WebMD Site before you visit the third party site.\nIn addition, if you see a phrase such as \"Powered by\" or \"in association with\" followed by the name of a company other than WebMD, then you are on a website hosted by a company other than WebMD.&nbsp.\nWhen you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of WebMD, such as WebMD Lab Testing), or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, where applicable, we may pass the collected information back to that partner, which may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the Services.</p>\n<p>We may also include social widgets on the WebMD Sites which enable you to interact with the associated social media services, e.g., to share an article.\nThese widgets may collect browsing data which may be received by the third party that provided the widget, and are controlled by these third parties.\nYou may be able to manage your privacy preferences directly with the applicable social network platform.</p> Compliance with Law, Regulation, and Law Enforcement Requests <p>To cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with law, we may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order.\n(2) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.\nor (3) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights.\nIn addition, we may disclose personal information as described below.</p> How Your Information is Secured and Retained <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect the security of your personal information.\nDespite WebMD's efforts to protect your personal information, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your information over the Internet may be intercepted.</p>\n<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.&nbsp.\nWhen you enter personal information (including personal health information in various Services), we encrypt the transmission of that information or use SSL connections (Secure Socket Layer) technology.</p>\n<p>We will retain your personal information as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services.\nAt any time you can remove your personal information or instruct us to remove it, but you should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to WebMD from our servers.\nSee \u201cYour Choices and Rights\u201d below for more information on how you can update or remove your personal information.\nWe will also retain your personal information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p> Your Choices and Rights Updating/Removing Your Personal Information <p>If you do not want your personal information used

of that type in the future from WebMD unless you re-subscribe.</p> Cookies <p>Most browser software can be set to reject Cookies.\nMost browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the \"Help\" or \u201cSettings\u201d or \u201cPreferences\u201d section of your browser\u2019s toolbar.\n&nbsp;Refer to our Cookie Policy for additional information about opting out of Cookies.</p> Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out <p>In order to give you more control over your privacy choices we have implemented a DAA (Digital Advertising Alliance) approved opt-out mechanism for interest-based advertising.\nAt the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites you will see an AdChoices logo (which looks like this:).\n&nbsp;In our flagship WebMD App you can find the AdChoices option in the \u201cSettings\u201d screen.\n&nbsp;By clicking on that logo on the WebMD Sites or following the instructions in the flagship WebMD App, you will be presented with a window&nbsp;that will identify all of the companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you, both on the WebMD Sites and in the flagship WebMD App as well as on third-party websites.\nIf you would like to stop this tailored advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that window.\nPlease note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements through the Services.\nPlease note that your choice to stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or mobile device too.\nBy clicking the + symbol next to the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements.\nThe WebMD Sites do not respond to web browser \"do not track\" signals.\nThis opt-out mechanism is available in the flagship WebMD App for iOS and Android, as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD Allergy).</p> Mobile Opt-out <p>You may also control interest-based advertising on your mobile device by enabling the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d setting in your iOS device\u2019s settings or \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d in your Android device\u2019s settings.\nThis will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests.&nbsp.\nIf you have questions about how to reject cookies on your specific device please check with the device manufacturer.</p> California Residents <p>If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information.\nFor more

LLC (\"WebMD,\" \"we\" or \"us\") and our partners on our websites, applications, advertisements and related services, including WebMD.com, MedicineNet.com, RxList.com, OnHealth.com, and eMedicineHealth.com and the mobile optimized versions of these sites and our Mobile Device Applications or \"Apps\" (we refer to these sites and Apps collectively as the \"WebMD Sites\").\nWe refer to the WebMD Sites, along with the information and services made available to you through the WebMD Sites, as the \"Services.\"</p>\n<p>Please refer to the WebMD Privacy Policy to learn more about the use of cookies and other tracking technologies on the WebMD Sites and how you can contact us for more information.</p> Cookies <p>\"Cookies\" are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a website.\nEvery computer that accesses a WebMD Site&nbsp;is assigned a different cookie by WebMD.\nDifferent Cookies serve different purposes:</p>\n<p>\n<u>Session cookies</u> are specific to&nbsp;a particular visit and carry information as you view different pages within a WebMD Site.\nSession cookies expire and delete themselves automatically in a short period of time, e.g., when you leave the website or when you close your browser.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Persistent&nbsp;cookies</u>&nbsp;enable us to recognize you when you visit a WebMD Site and remember your preferences.\nPersistent cookies are stored on your browser or mobile device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Third-party cookies</u>&nbsp;are placed by someone other than WebMD, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and sessions.\nThey are usually persistent cookies and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each third-party cookie.</p>\n<p>\"Web Beacons\" are graphic image files embedded in a page of a website typically used to monitor activity on the page and send back to its home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the Web Beacon is located, the type of browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.</p>\n<p>\"Application SDKs\" are mobile application third-party software development kits that are embedded in mobile applications.\nThese app SDKs permit the collection of information about the app itself, activity in the app, and the device the application is running on.</p> Cookie on the WebMD Sites <p>The cookies on the WebMD Sites are generally used for one of the following purposes:</p>\n<p>\n<u> Strictly necessary.</u> These cookies are&nbsp;necessary for the WebMD Sites to function and are essential to access some areas of the WebMD Sites.\nFor example, certain cookies enable us to identify registered members and ensure that they have access to content that is only available to registered members.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Important functionality.</u> These cookies enable us to remember your preferences, such as your user name, language or the region you are in, and provide enhanced, more personalized features.\nThey may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Performance and Analytics.</u> These cookies enable us to analyze how visitors use the WebMD Sites and to monitor website performance.\nWe use the information collected by these Cookies to improve the performance of the WebMD Sites and our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Advertising.</u> These cookies are used by WebMD and our advertisers to deliver advertisements on the WebMD Sites and third party sites that are more relevant to you and your interests based on your WebMD account information, content browsing activity and in some cases, other information about you that we or our advertisers may have obtained from other sources.\nCookies may be used to limit the number of times you see a particular advertisement and to enable measurement of the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.\nInformation collected through the use of cookies may be collected directly by WebMD, our partners or third party advertisers and their ad servers.</p>\n<p>We use cookies and other tracking technologies to recognize individual users when they access the Services, remember user preferences, keep track of users\u2019 access to and use of the Services, track whether our emails opened and whether links are clicked, ensure that the Services are functioning properly, analyze trends and to personalize the Services, including advertising on the WebMD Sites and on third party websites, so that it is relevant to individual user\u2019s interests which may be inferred based on location, prior activity on the WebMD Sites and other information that WebMD or our partners may have about our users.\nWhen you use the Services, we also automatically collect information from your browser or mobile device such as your IP address or unique device identifier, browser information (including referring URL), your preferences and settings, cookies and information about the content you have viewed and actions taken (e.g., search queries, ad engagement, clicks and the associated dates and times).\nWebMD may also collect device-specific information when you install and use an App including your device model, operating system information, advertising ID (which is a unique, user-resettable identification number for advertising associated with a mobile device) and app version and usage information.\nWhen enabled by you, we collect precise location information provided by your mobile device, which you may disable through the device settings.&nbsp;</p> Third Party Cookies <p>Sponsors or advertisers on the WebMD Sites may use their own cookies or other tracking technologies in the banner advertisements and sponsored links and on the pages (\"Brand Pages\") on the WebMD Sites that consist solely of advertisements or other content from our advertisers.\nThis advertiser content may also be served in emails, special promotions or newsletters we send you.\nTheir advertisements may be displayed on the WebMD Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the WebMD Sites.\nSome advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these ad servers may also collect information through the use of cookies on the WebMD Sites.</p>\n<p>While we generally permit the use of these third party cookies on the assumption that they comply with our Advertising Policy and we assist our advertisers with the placement of cookies on Brand Pages, we do not control how third parties use cookies or how they manage the information they gather through the use of these technologies on the WebMD Sites and we may be unable to verify compliance with our Advertising Policy.\nTo see how Google may use information collected through your use of Google's search services on the WebMD Sites visit https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners.</p>\n<p>We work with third party ad networks to display advertising on the WebMD Sites and on third party sites.\nOur ad network vendors use technologies to collect information about your activities on the WebMD Sites and our flagship WebMD App to provide you cookie-based targeted advertising based upon your browsing activity and your interests.\nThe specific providers we use are subject to change, however below is a list of some of our current ad network partners:</p>\n<p>\n<u>Direct</u>\n</p> Amazon AppNexus Facebook Google Index Exchange Live Intent Media.Net PubMatic Rubicon Sharethrough Teads Trustx <p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<u>Resellers Through Media.net</u>\n</p> Brealtime Conversant Media District M Lijit OpenX Pulsepoint Sovrn SpotX <p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Because your browser, App, or device communicates with these third parties respective servers, these companies can collect information, including your IP address, page header information, browser or device information, just as if you had requested their website or used their apps directly.\nThese companies may collect information to deliver you customized ads on both the WebMD Sites and non-WebMD websites, applications, and services.\nIn some situations, WebMD may interact with these companies outside of your browser or device, directly between our web servers.\n&nbsp;Many of these third parties offer information about their data collection practices, and in some cases, an opt-out, on their respective websites.\nPlease review each company\u2019s privacy policy to better understand the controls available to you.\n&nbsp;We encourage you to periodically review this Cookie Policy for the latest information on our ad network partners.</p> Your Choices <p>Most browser software can be set to reject cookies, and offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the \"Help\" or \"Settings\" or \"Preferences\" section of your browser\u2019s toolbar.\nIf you reject our cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of our websites may not work properly but you do not have to accept our cookies in order to productively use most features of our websites.\nIt is important to note that in order to use the opt-out services described below, such as the Network Advertising Initiative and the TRUSTed Ads\u2122 program, you must not reject all cookies because these opt-out procedures work by placing cookies on your browser that enable these opt-out procedures to function.\nThe \"opt-out cookies\" are placed, for example, in order to help prevent the placement of Cookies used for the targeting of advertising..</p>\n<p>Certain companies that serve ads allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the use of cookies.\nIn order to do so, you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual site.\nYou can also opt out of cookies for several ad servers by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site or by clicking here: https://preferences.truste.com/.\nThis website will also allow you to review the privacy policies of these ad servers.\nYou can find additional information and resources about how to opt out of advertising and related cookies by visiting the World Privacy Forum's Site.\n&nbsp;If you are located in the European Union (EU), you may also opt-out here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In order to give you more control over your privacy choices WebMD has implemented a DAA (Digital Advertising Alliance) approved opt-out mechanism for interest-based advertising.\nAt the bottom of every page of the WebMD Sites you will see an AdChoices logo&nbsp;(which looks like this:&nbsp;).\nIn our general WebMD App you can find the AdChoices option in the \u201cSettings\u201d screen.\nBy clicking on that logo on the WebMD Sites or following the instructions in the general WebMD App, you will be presented with a window that will identify all of the companies that WebMD uses to direct tailored advertisements to you, both on the WebMD Sites and general WebMD App as well as on third-party sites.\nIf you would like to stop this tailored advertising from WebMD, you can manage these advertisements through the choices in that window.\nPlease note that even if you opt-out of interest-based advertising, you will continue to receive generic advertisements through the Services.\nPlease note that your choice to stop tailored advertising is specific to the browser or mobile device that you are using so if you make a choice to opt out from one computer or mobile device and you want your opt-out to apply to a different computer or mobile device as well please opt out from that computer or mobile device too.\nBy clicking the + symbol next to the name of a vendor in that window you will get information about how and where that vendor assists us with the delivery of advertisements.\nThe WebMD Sites do not respond to web browser \"do not track\" signals.\nThis opt-out mechanism is also available in the general WebMD App for iOS and Android, as well as on our mobile optimized sites, but is not currently available on our other Apps (WebMD Pregnancy, WebMD Baby and WebMD Allergy).</p>\n<p>You may also control interest-based advertising on your mobile device by enabling the \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d setting in your iOS device\u2019s settings or \u201cOpt out of Ads Personalization\u201d in your Android device\u2019s settings.\nThis will not prevent you from seeing advertisements, but will limit the use of device advertising identifiers to personalize ads based on your interests.\n&nbsp;If you have questions about how to reject Cookies on your specific device please check with the device manufacturer.</p> Additional Information for WebMD\u2019s Visitors from the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) <p>If you are a WebMD user in the EEA, before cookies are placed on your computer or device, you will be shown a banner requesting that you either accept or decline the placement of cookies.\nBy accepting the placement of cookies you are enabling us to provide the best possible experience and service to you.\nYou may, if you wish, decline the placement of cookies unless those cookies are strictly necessary.</p> Changes <p>WebMD reserves the right to change this Cookie Policy at any time and any changes will be effective upon being posted unless we advise otherwise.\n&nbsp;We encourage you to periodically review this Cookie Policy for the latest information about the use of cookies on the WebMD Sites.</p> Last updated on December 07, 2020 \u00a9 2018 WebMD, LLC.\nAll rights reserved.\n", "created_at": "2019-08-15 02:43:17.256095", "updated_at": "2020-12-15 00:15:42.686491"}, {"id":
