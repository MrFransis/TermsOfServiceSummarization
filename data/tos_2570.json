potential risks, use a wide range of advice, and use your own judgement before deciding what to do.\nWe hope you\u2019ll understand that we are not liable or responsible for the actions you take \u2013 basically that whatever you do is done at your own risk.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It\u2019s free</strong> \u2013 Umbrella is free to use and there are no advertisements.\nIts development is
