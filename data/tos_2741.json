conflicts-of-law principles thereof.\nWith respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York with respect to any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with the Service or from a dispute as to the interpretation or breach of the TOS.</p>\n<p>14.\nArbitration.</p>\n<p>By using this site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Bloomberg and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the \u201cBloomberg Entities\u201d) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the website or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS.\n(2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16.\n(3) the

subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator.\nIn addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Bloomberg will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.\nand (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein.\nIf, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Bloomberg shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.\nFor more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at www.jamsadr.com.</p>\n<p>15.\nExcluded Jurisdictions, Economic Sanctions &amp.\nExport
