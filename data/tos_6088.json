which a violation of the AUP or TOS has occurred, however, Limenex does reserve the right to suspend or terminate an account with or without notice at its own discretion.\nThe Customer agrees to maintain up to date primary contact email information with Limenex.\nThe violation shall be listed in the Subject of the email sent from our abuse department (abuse@limenex.com).\nThe Customer shall be given all appropriate details of the Violation as well as a time frame to correct the issue before action shall be taken.\nOnce the email has been sent to The Customer, Limenex will consider that The Customer has been notified.\nLimenex reserves the right to use discretion on the amount of time given for a customer to correct the issue before action is taken.\n</li>\n<li>\nFor example: A violation containing a \"Phishing\" site is lodged against the customer, the offending files will be immediately disabled and the customer will be given 24 hours to clean and secure the site.\nIf after 24 hours the Customer has not replied confirming they have taken action, further action may be taken such as suspending the individual site and/or suspending the entire VPS or Dedicated Server.\n</li>\n<li>\nFor example: A violation resulting in a \"Spam\" complaint.\nWe may investigate the complaint to determine how the spam is being sent.\nWe may provide a best effort analysis to locate the source of the spam.\nIf for example it is being sent from a script, we may attempt to disable that script and notify The Customer.\nIf it is being sent from an individual account, if possible, we may attempt to disable password access to that account.\nWe may then notify the customer giving them 24 hours to investigate the complaint and provide a resolution to the abuse complaint.\nShould we be unable to isolate and/or disable the source of the \"Spam\" we may place a SMTP filter against The Customer's service to prevent additional emails from being sent out until at which time a resolution to the issue is made.\nIf after 24 hours no response has been received from the customer, additional steps may be taken to ensure the \"Spam\" has been stopped such as system wide SMTP filters, suspension of individual sites, disabling password access to certain accounts, disabling of scripts or as a final step suspension of all services.\n</li>\n<li>\nFor example: A violation resulting from \"Resource Abuse\".\nWe may investigate the resource abuse and provide the Customer with a best effort analysis of the problem causing the resource abuse.\nAt which time the Customer may be given a time frame to make the corrections to their code, scripts, MySQL queries or software services running.\nIf the issue is not corrected within the time frame given, Limenex may then take further steps to ensure the stability of the network and servers and may take actions including but not limited to disabling plugins, themes, accounts, scripts, services and in reserves the right to issue a full service suspension depending on the severity of the issue based upon Limenex's judgment of the scenario.\n</li>\n<li>\nNone of the above examples are meant to be specific guidelines with regards to how each and every case may be handled.\nLimenex reserves full rights to use its judgment and discretion in how each individual case is handled.\n</li>\n<li>\nLimenex handles any and all Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) complaints very seriously and will thoroughly investigate each complaint received.\nLimenex reserves the right to pursue civil remedies for any costs associated with the investigation of a substantiated policy violation.\nThe following actions will be taken on a case-by-case basis:\n<ol>\n<li>A ticket is opened as a warning, providing 24 hours to resolve the situation.</li>\n<li>After 24 hours with no client response, connection to the IP address from the DMCA complaint will be disabled at the network level.\nAt this time, Limenex reserves the right to assess a USD$50 fine.</li>\n<li>After 72 hours with no resolution, services on the server in question will be suspended.</li>\n<li>After 7 days of being suspended and the issue not having been resolved, services on the server in question will be canceled and an Abuse Charge of USD$300 will be placed on the account.\nAll client data will be destroyed immediately after the cancellation date.</li>\n<li>Customers who violate this policy and fail to resolve the situation within 24 hours agree that in addition to these administrative penalties, they will pay 'Research Fees' not to exceed USD$75 per hour that Limenex personnel must spend to investigate the matter, to be charged only if claims are found to be valid.</li>\n<li>Limenex may charge $50 per abuse incident as
