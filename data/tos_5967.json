services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Platform Data Analytics Service Providers\n<ul>\n<li>We use analytics providers to gather analytics related data reporting capabilities to monitor visitors and usage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Platform Error Tracking Service Providers\n<ul>\n<li>We may share information with one or more platform error tracking service providers to improve the quality and reliability of the services.\nUser IP address information and usernames may be sent to these parties for diagnostic purposes.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Support Tickets\n<ul>\n<li>Hypothesis uses a hosted solution for support ticket management.\nUpon creating a support ticket, we require that users provide an email address so we can contact them regarding their ticket.\nAt any time, you can request for your support tickets to be anonymized or deleted by emailing support@hypothes.is.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hypothesis doesn\u2019t share user information with advertisers, affiliates or partners.\nHowever, we do provide API access to our systems to third parties, as described above (Authenticated and Unauthenticated users) who access user information such as annotations (along with username of annotator, URL of annotation source, and text body of annotation) for which they have specific permissions to access.\nWe do not monetize our user traffic in any way.</p>\nAutomated Processing of Personal Information\n<p>Hypothesis does not engage in any automated processing (i.e.\nprofiling) of user information at this time.\nUsers should be aware that third parties with access to our services using our APIs may engage in automated processing of user information.</p>\nSecuring Your Personal Information\n<p>Hypothesis secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure using the following methods:</p>\n<p>When personal information is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>\n<p>User passwords are salted and hashed using the industry standard \u201cbcrypt\u201d algorithm.\nNo Hypothesis staff member has access to user passwords.\nHypothesis staff have access to user email addresses only for support purposes.</p>\n<p>We retain user IP address information and request information for a strictly limited period for diagnostic purposes only.\nWe also collect some information in aggregate about your activities within our application from the client.\nThis de-identified information is used for internal metrics and operational support, but we do not track your individual activity.</p>\nBreach of Privacy\n<p>In case of a breach of private information, we will notify affected users via the email address associated with their account within 72 hours of uncovering the breach.</p>\nInternational Transfer of Your Personal Information\n<p>Hypothesis operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally.\nIn particular, your information will likely be transferred to and processed via servers located in the USA.\nThe USA, European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) Member States, and other countries all have different laws.\nWhen your information is moved from your home country to another country, the laws and rules that protect your personal information in the country to which your information is transferred may be different from those in the country in which you live.\nFor example, the circumstances in which law enforcement can access personal information may vary from country to country.\nIn particular, if your information is in the USA, it may be accessed by government authorities in accordance with laws in the USA.</p>\n<p>To the extent that Hypothesis is deemed to transfer personal information outside of the EEA, we rely separately, alternatively, and independently on the following legal bases to transfer your information:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>.\nHypothesis does not participate in Privacy Shield at this time.\nHowever, Hypothesis may rely on the EU-USA Privacy Shield to transfer personal information to some of our third-party service providers in the United States of America, where they are certified to receive such information under the&nbsp;Privacy Shield Program.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Necessary for the performance of the contract</strong>.\nHypothesis provides voluntary services.\nyou can choose whether or not you want to use our services.\nHowever, if you want to use our services, you need to agree to our&nbsp;Terms of Service which set out the contract between Hypothesis and its users.\nAs we operate in countries worldwide (including in the USA) and may use technical infrastructure in the USA to deliver our services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer your personal information to the USA and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide our services.</p>\nRetention\n<p>Hypothesis will keep information provided by users and third-party service providers for no longer than is necessary for operating and improving our services.\nMoreover, Hypothesis will respect of rights of individual users who request that their information be removed, updated, etc.</p>\n<p>Hypothesis will retain your information for as long as your account is active (i.e.\nfor the lifetime of your Hypothesis account), as described in this policy, or as needed to provide our services to you.\nIf you no longer want Hypothesis to use your information to provide our services to you, you may close your account.\nHypothesis will retain and use your information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your information to comply with applicable tax/revenue laws), resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as otherwise described in this policy.\nWe also retain log files for internal analysis purposes.\nThese log files are generally retained for a brief period of time, except in cases where they are used for site safety and security, to improve site functionality, or when we are legally obligated to retain them for longer time periods.</p>\nYour Rights\nRight to Access User Information\n<p>Users have a right to access their User Information (email, username, number of annotations, group membership, annotations, etc) at any time either through their user settings or by logging into the services.</p>\nRight to Update User Information\n<p>Users have a right to update their User Information (email, username, number of annotations, group membership, etc) at any time either through their user settings (i.e.\nhttps://hypothes.is/users/[username])) or by contacting Hypothesis at support@hypothes.is and submitting an email request to have their user Information updated.\nHypothesis may request identifying information to confirm the identity of the party requesting an update.</p>\nUpdate or Delete Annotations\n<p>Users have a right to update or delete their public, private, and group annotations.\nAny update or delete request of public annotations will take affect going forward in our systems, but any prior publication of the \u201cun-edited\u201d public or group annotation captured by third parties with API access (authenticated or unauthenticated) to our systems may still retain the original, unchanged public or group annotation which they may have retrieved prior to the update or delete request.</p>\nAbility to Update Privacy Settings Associated with Annotations\n<p>Hypothesis annotations have one of three privacy settings: fully public, public within an annotation group, and fully private (visible only to its author).\nAnnotators can change the visibility (privacy settings) of any of their annotations in the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Private annotations can be made more public</em>.\nDepending on their context, they can either be made visible publicly or only to members of an annotation group.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Public annotations and annotations shared with groups can be made private</em>, thereafter visible only to their authors, but others may have seen such annotations and/or captured them via the API while they were more widely available.</li>\n</ul>\nRight to Erasure\n<p>Users have a right to delete their user Information (email, username, active status, number of annotations, group membership, etc) at any time by contacting Hypothesis at support@hypothes.is and submitting an email request to have their user Information deleted.\nHypothesis may request identifying information to confirm the identity of the party requesting an update.</p>\n<p>Please note that any annotations captured by our services prior to request for deletion by a user would have been accessible to API users, and we do not have a mechanism to force those API users to remove that information, but we will respect the request of the user and delete it from our services going forward.</p>\nData Portability\n<p>Users have the right to receive a copy of the information maintained about them, which they have provided to our

them or assisting them with their subject access requests in a timely manner in order to remedy concerns users have about their personal information.</p>\nRight to Object\n<p>Our services do not justify data processing on the basis of legitimate interest.\nTherefore, this right does not apply to our services.</p>\nRight to Not Be Subject to Automated Decision Making\n<p>Our services do not provide decisions based solely on automated processing that produces legal effects concerning the user.\nTherefore, this right does not apply to our services.</p>\nWithdrawing Consent\n<p>Where you have provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and your use of our services.\nFor example, you can withdraw your consent to email communications by using the unsubscribe links in such emails.\nYou can choose to withdraw your consent to our processing of your information and your use of our services at any time by closing your account and then emailing support@hypothes.is to request that your personal information be deleted, except for information that we are required to retain.\nThis deletion is permanent and your account cannot be reinstated.</p>\nE-mail Communications &amp.\nHow to Opt-Out\n<p>From time to time, we may contact you via email for the purpose of providing news, announcements, alerts, confirmations, surveys, and/or other general communication.\nIn order to improve our services, we may receive notifications when you open, forward, or click on links in emails from us.</p>\n<p>Please note that email communications from us about our services or annotation beyond the administration of your account are opt-in.\nIf you would like to stop receiving such email communications, you may opt out using the

email.\nSubscriber activity is tracked and stored in a database for future analysis and evaluation.\nSuch tracked activity may include but shall not be limited to: the opening of emails, forwarding of emails, the clicking of links within the email content, times, dates and frequency of activity.\nThis information is used to refine future email campaigns and supply the users with more relevant content based on their activity.</p>\n<p>You may also control the receipt of certain types of communications from us.\nWe may send you messages about our services or your activity.\nSome of these messages are required, services-related messages for users (such as transactional messages, email confirmation, replies to annotations, or legal notices).\nOther messages are not required, such as newsletters and announcements.\nYou can control which optional messages you choose to receive via the unsubscribe links in our emails.</p>\n<p>If you no longer wish to use our services or receive services-related messages (except for legally required notices), then you may close your account by contacting us at support@hypothes.is.</p>\nAdditional Information or Assistance\n<p>We encourage you to reach out to us at support@hypothes.is to resolve any issues or concerns that you may have with this privacy policy or the ways we manage your information.\nIn the event that you feel that we have not resolved your issue via email or support ticket communications, you have the right to file a complaint with your local supervisory authority or regulatory agency.</p>\nModifications and Changes to
