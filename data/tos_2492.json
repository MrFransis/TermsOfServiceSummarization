and\nyou are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account.\nYou\nmust not use another person\u2019s Slidejoy account or share your password with\nanother person.\nWhen creating your account, you must provide accurate, complete\nand non-misleading information.\nYou agree to immediately notify Slidejoy of any\nunauthorized uses of your account or login credentials or any other breaches of\nsecurity.\nSlidejoy will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,\nincluding any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or\nomissions.\nOur current policy limits you to the creation of only one Slidejoy\naccount per mobile device.\n</p>\n<p>Account features differ\ndepending on whether they are held by End Users (each, an \u201cEnd User Account\u201d)\nor Advertisers (each, an \u201cAdvertiser Account\u201d).\nSpecial features and terms and\nconditions pertaining to End User Accounts and Advertiser Accounts are set\nforth in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively.\n</p>\n<b>\n<i>A.\n</i>\n</b>\n<b>\n<i>Slidejoy Application</i>\n</b>\n<p>When you download the Slidejoy Application,\nyou will be prompted to register for an End User Account, and Slidejoy may then\nbegin displaying Ad Content on the lockscreen of your mobile phone.\nAfter that,\nall of your interactions with Slidejoy will be recorded, stored in our servers,\nand associated with your End User Account.\nAmong other things, your End User\nAccount will keep track of your Carats, your Carat redemption options, and your\nCarat redemption history.\nYOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCRUE, RECEIVE AND STORE\nCARATS WHEN SIGNED INTO YOUR END USER ACCOUNT.\nFrom time to time, at Slidejoy\u2019s\nsole and absolute discretion, you may have the option to redeem your Carats for\ncash or other benefits.\n</p>\n<p>There is more than one way to\nreceive Carats using the Slidejoy Application.\nThe simplest way is by engaging\nwith Slidejoy by moving the lockscreen unlock slider (i)&nbsp;to the right to\nunlock your phone, or (ii)&nbsp;to the left to engage with the Ad Content.\nFor\nexample, if you slide left to watch a video advertisement, you may receive Carats,\nor if you use a coupon provided through the Application, you may receive Carats.\nHowever, please note that in each case, you will have the opportunity to\nreceive the <b>\n<i>same number of Carats </i>\n</b>by\nsliding right to simply unlock your screen.\nThe reason is that Slidejoy aims for\nhonest interactions and discourages disingenuous interactions intended for the\nsole purpose of generating Carats.\nWhile you are not prohibited from sliding\nleft every time Ad Content is displayed on your lockscreen, Slidejoy\u2019s\nproprietary smart algorithm is optimized to screen for abuse and will\nautomatically decrease the number of Carats offered to End Users who attempt to\nabuse the system.\nTherefore over time, you may find that sliding left too much\nwill result in a reduced opportunity to receive Carats.\nTo avoid these\nconsequences, Slidejoy recommends that you use your smartphone or mobile device\nas you normally do and that you engage only with Ad Content that genuinely\ninterests you.\n</p>\n<b>\n<i>B.\n</i>\n</b>\n<b>\n<i>Flappy Kings Application</i>\n</b>\n<p>When you download the Flappy\nKings Application, you may either begin playing immediately or you will be\nprompted to register for an End User Account.\nIf you register for an End User\nAccount, all of your interactions with Slidejoy will be recorded, stored in our\nservers, and associated with your End User Account.\nThe Flappy Kings\nApplication will allow you to acquire Coins, which you can then use to enter Tournaments\nor Sweepstakes to win Carats.\nThough you may use the Flappy Kings Application\nwithout an End User Account, YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCRUE, RECEIVE AND STORE\nCOINS AND CARATS WHEN SIGNED INTO YOUR END USER ACCOUNT.\nFOR THE AVOIDANCE OF\nDOUBT, PRIZES RECEIVED FROM A TOURNAMENT OR SWEEPSTAKES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN BY\nA SUBSEQUENT PRIZE IF YOU DO NOT SIGN UP FOR AN END USER ACCOUNT BEFORE THE\nRESULTS OF THE SECOND TOURNAMENT OR SWEEPSTAKES ARE POSTED.\nAmong other things,\nyour End User Account will keep track of your Coins and Carats, your Carat\nredemption options, and your Carat redemption history.\nFrom time to time, at\nSlidejoy\u2019s sole and absolute discretion, you may have the option to redeem your\nCarats for cash or other benefits.\n</p>\n<p>There is more than one way to\nreceive Coins using the Flappy Kings Application.\nYou can accrue Coins while\nplaying Flappy Kings, or you can watch Ad Content on the Main Menu of the\nFlappy Kings Application.\n<b>You may only use Coins to participate\nin Tournaments or Sweepstakes, as defined below.</b>\n</p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nTournaments</p>\n<p>You may enter contests of skill\n(\u201cTournaments\u201d) on the Flappy Kings Application to try to earn Carats.\nYou may\nbe required to enter a Tournament using Coins that you have acquired using the Flappy\nKings Application.\nEnd Users with the highest points at the end of a Tournament\nperiod are the winners.\nTournament Official Rules can be found here: https://www.getslidejoy.com/terms#tournament.\n&nbsp;By participating, you agree to\nthese Tournament Official Rules, including any Specific Tournament Terms.</p>\n<p>ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nSweepstakes</p>\n<p>You may also enter games of\nchance (\u201cSweepstakes\u201d) on the Flappy Kings Application to try to win Carats.\nYou may enter a Sweepstakes (i) via the Flappy Kings Application using Coins\nthat you have acquired using the Flappy Kings Application, or (ii) by submitting\na 3 X 5 postcard for free entry.\nAt the end of a Sweepstakes period, a winner\nwill be drawn at random.\nSweepstakes Official Rules can be found here: https://www.getslidejoy.com/terms#sweepstake.\nBy participating, you agree to these Sweepstakes Official Rules, including any\nSpecific Sweepstakes Terms.</p>\n<b>\n<i>C.\n</i>\n</b>\n<b>\n<i>Applications Generally</i>\n</b>\n<p>Whether you are using the\nSlidejoy Application or the Flappy Kings Application, or both, your Coin and\nCarat balance (\u201cRewards\u201d) will be reflected in your End User Account.\nIf you\nuse both Applications to acquire Rewards, your End User Account will reflect\nthe entire balance of Rewards from both Applications.\nDepending on the current\nvalue of a Carat, which will be determined at Slidejoy\u2019s sole and absolute\ndiscretion, you may, from time to time, redeem them for cash, products and\nservices, and or convert them into charitable contributions.\n</p>\n<p>Rewards obtained via the\nApplications are provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable,\nnon-transferable, non-sublicenseable license.\nRewards may not be transferred or\nresold in any manner, including, without limitation, by means of any direct\nsale or auction service.\nYou have no property interest, right or title in or to\nany such Rewards appearing or originating in the Applications, or any other\nattributes associated with use of Slidejoy or its Applications.\nAny Reward\nbalance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or\nreflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent\nof your license.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>PLEASE\nNOTE THAT SLIDEJOY DOES NOT AND CANNOT PROMISE OR GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL\nRECEIVE ANY NUMBER OF REWARDS OR THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE ANY AMOUNT OF AD CONTENT\nIN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, OR ANY AMOUNT OF VALUE, MONETARY\nOR OTHERWISE, WHEN YOU REDEEM YOUR CARATS</b>.\nSlidejoy\u2019s ability to provide Rewards depends on whether, and how much, Slidejoy gets paid by the relevant Advertiser, and due to the complex nature of its relationships with Advertisers, whether Slidejoy gets paid, and how much, may vary over time.\nWe will, in our sole and absolute discretion, determine and communicate the availability and exchange rate of Rewards, which may be modified at any time.\nThe availability and exchange rate for Rewards may vary for a variety of reasons, such as non-payment by Advertisers or changes in our arrangements with Advertisers or in applicable laws and regulations.\nYou must comply with any individual Reward limitations as indicated by Slidejoy (or Advertiser\u2019s terms or website).\nWe reserve the right to cancel, restrict or terminate Rewards at any time for any reason.\nAll redemptions are subject to this Agreement and any third-party terms associated with Advertisers.\n</p>\n<p>As noted, each time you receive\nRewards, we place the Rewards in your End User Account.\nYour ability to receive\nand redeem Rewards is conditioned on your compliance with the Agreement.\nYou\nmay access your End User Account to modify your account settings or to review\nyour Reward balances and Carat redemption choices.\nYou may log in by entering\nyour username and password with the Applications or through the Site.\n</p>\n<p>You may log into your End User\nAccount to redeem your accumulated Carats.\nWhile we reserve the right to modify\nwhen and how you can redeem Carats at any time in our sole and absolute\ndiscretion, as of the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date of this Agreement set forth below\n(the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), you can redeem your Carats by visiting the area of your\nEnd User Account interface (accessible through the Application) called the Exchange\nView (the \u201cExchange View\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>While in Exchange View, you may\nredeem your Carats pursuant to one of the redemption methods then available to\nyou.\nAs of the Effective Date, End Users may have a choice to exchange their Carats\nto donate to various nonprofit organizations directly in the app (\u201cHero Mode\u201d)\nor receive a cash payout through PayPal or another third party payment provider\nwe may make available to you for redemption purposes from time to time (\u201cNormal\nMode\u201d).\nFrom time to time, Carats may also be redeemable for gift cards, products,\nservices and other special offers.\n</p>\n<p>When using the Slidejoy\nApplication, your Carat balance will be updated on the first of each month (each\nsuch date, a \u201cPay Day\u201d), and the updated balance will include Carats up until\nthe last day of the previous month.\nFor example, February&nbsp;Carats earned\nthrough the Slidejoy Application will be eligible for redemption on March 1.\nWhen\nusing the Flappy Kings Application, any Carats earned will be immediately\nredeemable.\n<b>For both Applications, however, the Carats\nremain the property of Slidejoy, not you, at all times</b>.\n</p>\n<p>You may close your End User\nAccount at any time by logging in and adjusting the appropriate settings.\nWe\nwill ask that you use Rewards prior to closing your Slidejoy Account.\nIf your\nEnd User Account is closed and you fail to properly or completely use your Rewards\nbefore such time, you will no longer be able to use or redeem them.</p>\n<p>In addition, your End User\nAccount will be terminated after three (3) months of inactivity.\nWe also reserve\nthe right to terminate your End User Account at any time for breach of this\nAgreement.\nYou will no longer be able to use any Rewards in your End User\nAccount after termination.\nWe may do this without prior notice, but may attempt\nto notify you afterward where feasible.\n</p> 6.\nADVERTISER ACCOUNTS <p>Advertisers may access

and web beacons, to collect information from any computer or mobile device you use to access the Services about your activities on our Site or interaction with our advertisements (see \u201cInformation Collected by Third Parties\u201d below).\nA cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of your computer that allows your computer's browser to store your preferences and allows Slidejoy, our Advertisers, authorized service providers, advertising companies and ad networks to identify you by a unique identifier and associate this with corresponding information in our or their database.\nThrough the use of a cookie, we and these companies may store your non-personally identifiable registration information and user preferences and may also automatically collect information about your online activity on our Site, such as the web pages you visit, the links or advertisements you click, or the other actions you conduct while on our Site.\nIn addition, Slidejoy may set a cookie on your computer when you view our advertisements delivered on or in connection with a third-party website you are visiting.\nAfter a cookie is set, Slidejoy may track how you interact with the Ad Content (for example, registering, purchasing, clicking, browsing, etc.).\nMost browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.\nIf you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Services.\nWe do not tie tracking cookies used for behavioral or targeted advertising purposes to any Personal Information you submit while on our site.\nhowever, cookies may be tied to your Personal Information solely for purposes of effectuating transactions you have requested and similar purposes related to the operation of our Site (such as managing our relationships with Advertiser and tracking, processing, maintaining and redeeming your Rewards Points).\nThey do NOT, however, collect Personal Information.\nAlthough we may place or allow third parties to place their cookies when you visit our Site (as described more fully in the subsection below entitled \u201cTargeted or Behavioral Advertising\u201d), we do not have access or control over third party cookies nor does our privacy policy cover the use of cookies by third parties.\nWe may use other standard Internet activity tracking technologies, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use on our Site, Application or your interactions with Ad Content.\nA web beacon is a programming code used to display an image on a web page and can also transfer an individual's user identification to a database and associate the individual with previously acquired information about the individual.\nSuch information may be used in targeted or behavioral advertising, as well as for the other uses described in this paragraph.\nWe may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters or online advertisements to determine whether messages have been opened or acted upon.\nWe may use the information we obtain in this manner to customize the Services, Ad Content and offers we provide to users via our Site and Application, to deliver targeted advertisements through such vehicles, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.\nWe do not tie web beacons to any Personal Information you submit while on our Site.\nInformation Collected by Third Parties: Targeted or Behavioral Advertising.\nTargeted advertising (also known as behavioral advertising) uses information collected on an individual's web browsing or mobile application behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made to target advertising to the user based on this behavior.\nThis information is then used to select which Slidejoy advertising should be displayed to a particular individual on websites or mobile applications other than the Site or Application.\nFor example, if you have shown a preference for a certain product while visiting the Site, you may be served an advertisement from or about the Site for the same or a similar product when you visit a site other than the Slidejoy Site.\nThe information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number).\nit does not include any information that could be linked back to a particular person, such as their name, address or credit card number.\nThe information used for targeted advertising either comes from the Site, the Application or through third party website publishers.\nIn addition, we may place (or allow third parties to place) cookies and pixels on our Site or Application which enable our authorized service providers, advertising companies and advertising networks to collect information about our users who view or interact with their or our advertisements on our Site or Application or complete certain actions on our site, such as submitting an application or registration form.\nHowever, we do not tie these cookies and pixels to personal information that you submit on our Site or Application.\nThe information collected by the cookies and pixels allows us and the companies mentioned above to deliver, and gauge the effectiveness of, targeted advertisements, both on our site and when you are browsing other websites.\nSome of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (www.networkadvertising.org), which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.\n8.\nGlobal operation and Privacy Shield We base our services on AWS solutions, which has already obtained approval from EU data protection authorities, known as the Article 29 Working Party, of the AWS Data Processing Addendum and Model Clauses to enable transfer of data outside Europe, including to the U.S.\n9.\nOUR POLICY ON MINORS In principle, the Company does not collect any information from the children under 13 or equivalent minimum age as prescribed in the laws in the relevant jurisdiction.\nThe website, products, and services of the Company are the ones to be provided to ordinary people, in principle.\nThe Company does not intentionally collect any personal information from children.\nIf you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you must be at least 16 years of age to consent to personalized advertising

learn that we have collected any Personal Information from children under 16, then we will promptly take steps to delete such information.\n10.\nINFORMATION SECURITY We utilize reasonable information security measures to safeguard your Personal Information.\nFor example, industry-standard encryption (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure a/k/a \u201chttps\u201d) is used to protect communications between our servers and our users\u2019 web browsers and mobile devices.\nUnfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet and no method of data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its security.\n11.\nYOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS A California
