has always made it a key priority to protect the privacy of its Users.<p>This document was drawn up in accordance with article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (hereinafter \u201cRegulation\u201d), for users (hereinafter \u201cUsers\u201d or \u201cUser\u201d) of the products and services owned by <strong>Punkt Tronics AG</strong> VAT ID CHE-114.634.022 IVA, Reg.\nNo.\nCH-501.3.011.937-5, with registered office in Via Losanna 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland, in its capacity as <strong>Controller</strong> of the personal data (hereinafter \u201cController\u201d).</p>\n<p>This document will explain how your personal information is managed when you use the Pigeon Application created specially for the MP02 telephone, and, if necessary, to enable you to give your express, informed consent to your personal data being processed for other apps or functions that require access and interaction.</p>\n<p>Specific information is provided in the various sections of the website www.punkt.ch pursuant to article 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 which you will have to review before providing the data requested.</p>\n<p>The information and data that you provide or that is otherwise acquired when using the various punkt.ch services will be processed in accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation and storage limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, integrity and confidentiality.<br>&nbsp;</p>1.\nThe personal data that will be processed<p>The personal data is collected in order to distribute, maintain and update the Pigeon application.</p>\n<p>Even though the entire focus of the MP02 telephone has always been to protect the privacy and personal domain of the User, Pigeon is an application specifically developed to permit the phone to interact with Signal, an instant messaging application where the contents of communications are end-to-end encrypted.</p>\n<p>The end-to-end encryption of the data means that communications connected to the Signal account cannot be decoded by the platform managers and information that has to be shared for technical standpoint purposes is also used to the minimum extent possible, with said use informed by the principles of proportionality and necessity.</p>\n<p>Communications are designed to be kept confidential throughout their entire life cycle in the MP02 \u2013 Pigeon \u2013 Signal circuit.</p>\n<p>The MP02 phone encrypts data in the device, Pigeon maintains the security and integrity of the data during transmission and the Signal system provides end-to-end encryption.\nThis system allows the user to exchange synchronous and asynchronous confidential communication safely while always maintaining their own privacy and the privacy of others.</p>\n<p>Pigeon makes the MP02 phone compatible with the Signal secure communication system.\nBy giving permission when you register, you give Pigeon permission to access your MP02 Contacts list, use and record audio, view SMS messages, access photos/media/files and make/manage phone calls.\nYou may also deny permission.\nHowever, the permission is requested to enable certain features from Pigeon to Signal such as finding contacts, reading, receiving and sending messages, and making calls through secure end-to-end encryption communication on Pigeon.</p>\n<p>The information and personal data processed to <strong>download and install </strong>the basic functions of Pigeon are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>browsing and usage data generated by the device when it interacts with the Punkt infrastructure that can be accessed through the Internet.\nThis concerns information that is not collected to be associated with specific data subjects, but which, by its very nature, could allow users to be identified through processing and association with data held by third parties.\nIP addresses belong to this category, along with the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) notation of the resources requested, the time of the request, the method used when submitting the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code indicating the status of the data response from the server (successful, error, etc.) and other parameters relating to the operating system of the telephone and the User\u2019s ICT environment.\nThis data is generally only used to obtain anonymous statistical information on the use of the resources that can be accessed, to ensure that it works properly and to identify any anomalies and/or abuse.\nThe data may also be used to ascertain responsibility in the event of computer offences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The optional information and personal data that can be processed for Pigeon to work at an <strong>advanced level</strong> are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Personal contact data such as name, surname and email address which are needed to receive notifications and respond to any faults in the application;</li>\n</ul>2.\nProcessing

\u201cContact\u201d page on the website;</li>\n<li>The need to monitor how the services are provided, including on a computerised basis;</li>\n<li>The Controller has implemented an automatic control system for the exclusive purpose of security and prevention of fraudulent behaviour which monitors and analyses user behaviour on the support resources of the application, linked to the processing of certain Personal Data, including the IP address.</li>\n</ol>3.\nLegal basis and mandatory or optional nature of the processing<p>The Controller shall process Personal Data relating to the User if one

resolve technical issues relating to its installation;</li>\n<li>Processing is needed for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject, such as communicating the data to authorities who have the right to request them in the event of computer fraud [article 6.1, letter c) GDPR].</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In any case, the Controller can always be asked to clarify the legal basis behind any processing that is carried out on his or her data.</p>\n<p>The User will always have the option to decide whether or not to provide his or her personal data, but it has to be given to ensure access to certain services such as downloading the application or assistance if any faults arise.\nAny refusal, even though legitimate, to provide the data required in whole or in part, may make it impossible for Punkt to provide the services requested on a standard basis.</p>4.\nRecipients of the personal data<p>Employees and business partners of the Controller may be aware of and use the Personal Data that will be provided.\nThese employees and business partners shall be authorised in accordance with article 29 of the GDPR for the sole purpose of performing the activities strictly related to achieving the purposes declared in paragraph 2 above.</p>\n<p>The Personal Data may also be disclosed to third parties engaged to carry out the lawful processing on behalf of the Controller in their capacity as <strong>Processors</strong>.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the Personal Data of the Users may be disclosed to third parties for the following purposes, strictly necessary to provide the services requested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Archiving, hosting, management and maintenance of the back-end infrastructure related to the development and distribution of the application;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A simple request can be addressed to the Controller to obtain the list of any Data Processors engaged to process the data.</p>5.\nData processing and storage place<p>The Data are processed at the workplaces of the Controller and in any other place where the parties involved in the processing are located.</p>\n<p>The personal data may be transferred to the processors located in Switzerland exclusively for the purposes listed in paragraph 2, in full compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR which requires adequate guarantees with regard to transfers, with Switzerland currently offering an adequate level of protection.\nThere is more information available at the offices of the Controller.</p>6.\nProcessing mechanisms and security measures<p>The Personal Data is processed using computer and/or online instruments, with organisational mechanisms and methods that are strictly related to the purposes indicated and without any profiling being carried out.</p>\n<p>The Processing is carried out in accordance with mechanisms and instruments that can guarantee the security and confidentiality of the data in accordance with the provisions of article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p>\n<p>When the data is being processed, all technical, computer, organisational, logistical and procedural security measures will always be implemented to ensure an adequate level of protection of the data as required by law.</p>7.\nStorage period<p>The data will only be processed for the time necessary to fulfil the purposes for which they are requested.</p>\n<p>The browsing and use data implicitly collected when the application is downloaded and installed, with the associated logs, will be stored for a maximum period of 60 days for the exclusive purpose of security and the prevention of fraudulent conduct.</p>\n<p>The Personal Data may be stored for a longer period if required to fulfil legal obligations or by order of the authorities.</p>\n<p>All the Personal Data will be deleted upon expiry of the storage period.\nAt the end of said time period, the rights of access, erasure, rectification and the right to data portability may no longer be exercised.</p>8.\nRights of the data subjects<p>The data subjects may exercise certain rights with reference to the Data processed by the Controller.\nMore specifically, the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Withdraw consent at any

&amp.\nconditions in no way limit or replace the applicable consumer protection legislation.\nFor information about how we use and protect our customers\u2019 personal information, please see our&nbsp;<u>\n<strong>Data Protection Policy</strong>\n</u>.\n________________________________________\n<strong>1.\nThe parties</strong>\nThese terms and conditions regulate the sale contract between

&amp.\nconditions regulate all sale contracts entered into between Punkt.\nand the Customer.\nEach contract is subject to the terms &amp.\nconditions that are displayed on our website at the time of

query.\n<strong>(b) Pre-release advance orders</strong>\nAdvance orders enable you to secure a place in the queue for a product before it becomes available.\nWhen the product is released for sale, stocks are sent to customers who have placed advance orders before the product is made available to other customers.\nProducts are generally delivered to us in batches.\nthese batches may be smaller than the total number of customers who have placed advance orders, and there is no guarantee that you will be in the first group of customers to receive an advance-ordered product.\nIf it is not possible to fulfil your order from the first delivery to us, we shall email you with an estimated date of when we expect the next delivery of stock.\nAdvance orders will continue to be accepted until we have received enough stock to be able to fulfil all advance orders.\nthe product will then be placed on general sale.\nIf you wish to purchase multiple products, some that are in stock and some that are offered on an advance order basis, we recommend that you order them separately to avoid a delay in the shipment of the in stock products.\nWhen you place an advance order, you will at that point be charged the full cost of the product(s).\nIf for any reason you decide that you do not wish to continue waiting for the product, you have the right to cancel your order up until the point at which we send you an email informing you that the ordered product is being prepared for dispatch.\nif you do this, we shall send you a full refund within seven days.\nAlthough we aim to begin dispatching advance ordered products as soon as possible, you understand and accept that there may be delays.\nWe shall send you periodical updates regarding the anticipated dispatch schedule.\nAny estimated date of dispatch provided to you is subject to change and is without guarantee.\nIn the event of an estimated release and/or dispatch date not being met, Punkt.\nis not responsible for any costs that may occur due to this delay, nor shall we be obliged, to provide any discounts, refunds, credits or compensation due to any such delays other than a refund of the amount paid to us by you when you made your pre release advance order.\n________________________________________\n<strong>5.\nPayment</strong>\nAll prices quoted on our website are inclusive of VAT at the current rate.\nThe

currencies: Swiss francs (CHF), euros (EUR), British pounds (GBP), Norwegian krone (NOK), Swedish krona (SEK), Danish krone (DKK), Japanese Yen (JPY) and American dollars (USD).\nCurrencies are allocated according to shipping destination.\nFor payments made by credit card, debit card, PostFinance or Apple Pay, the payment process is transferred to the secure servers of the Swiss payment service provider&nbsp;<u>\n<strong>SIX Payment Services AG</strong>\n</u>.\nFor payment by PayPal, the process is directed to their secure servers.\nnote that you need to be already registered with them to be able to pay in this way.\nIf you choose to pay by bank transfer, during checkout you will be provided with instructions on how to do this.\nAn email will be sent to you duplicating these, for your convenience.\nOnce your payment is confirmed and the transaction is successful, you will be sent an email acknowledging your order.\nAll goods remain the property of Punkt.\nuntil full payment is received.\nIf payment does not reach us within five calendar days from the point at which your order is initially received by us, an email will be sent to you advising you of this.\nIf payment still has not reached us after an additional 25 days (total 30 days), the order will be cancelled.\nIn this situation there will be no obligations incumbent upon either party.\n________________________________________\n<strong>6.\nDelivery</strong>\nYou are responsible for providing an appropriate delivery address when ordering.\nWe will only be able to amend the delivery address if requested early enough.\nOrders for delivery to addresses in countries belonging to the European Union are provided by Punkt.\u2019s EU representative:\nS.A.T.\nsas\nF-68870 Bartenheim\nFrance\nPunkt.\narranges deliveries using UPS, DHL, and Swiss Post (who sometimes work with local partners, as appropriate).\nStandard delivery costs are separately displayed at the time of making the order and are calculated on the basis of the anticipated total weight of the package.&nbsp.\nStandard delivery is free for orders above the minimum order value established by the selected shipping country.\n&nbsp.\nOrders are usually dispatched within two working days, subject to stock availability.\n(Please note that we dispatch from a number of different countries, depending on destination, and these countries have different public holidays.) Dispatch may take a little longer at peak times, e.g.\nat Christmas, after new product launches and during promotional campaigns.\nOur e shop will not normally accept an order for a product that is not in stock, but exceptions to this can occasionally occur.\nIf this happens, we shall inform you of when the product is likely to be back in stock.\nyou can then decide whether to wait, request an alternative product or receive a refund.\nAt the e shop checkout stage, an estimated delivery time is shown for the selected country.\nStandard delivery usually takes 1 2 working days in Switzerland and 2-5 working days in the European Union, the UK, EFTA and USA (remote areas can take longer).\nStandard delivery to the rest of the world usually takes 5-10 working days.\nWe offer an express delivery option to the following destinations: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands.\nExpress delivery usually takes 1-2 working days.\nPlease note that estimated delivery times start from the date of dispatch and are indicative only.\nWe are not responsible for shipping delays caused by the actions of customs officials or couriers/local postal services.\n________________________________________\n<strong>7.\nCustomer's right of withdrawal (\u2018Returns\u2019)</strong>\n(a) Changing your mind\nIf, for any reason, you are not satisfied with your purchase from Punkt., you are entitled to withdraw from the contract within 30 days from receipt of the shipment, return the purchased product and receive a refund (including delivery cost).\nThis period of 30 days commences from the day after receipt of the purchased goods (reliance will be made upon the delivery date stated by the courier).\nWhen purchasing a product, you agree to exercise this right in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10 below, which describes how to return a product.\nIn particular, it is essential that you liaise with Punkt.\nbefore returning something to us, to ensure that a) it is shipped efficiently, b) it is sent to the appropriate destination, and c) it does not incur unnecessary taxes and customs duties.\nProducts that are returned to us without liaising with us first almost always arrive with extra charges due.\nif you return a product without following the procedure specified by us, you undertake to reimburse us for these charges.\n&nbsp.\nOnce a product\u2019s return has been authorised by Punkt., the product must be received at the address specified by us within 14 working days of the date that the authorisation was sent.\nAssuming everything is in order, we shall make the refund within 30 days from the date at which we first authorised the return.\nIn order for us to comply with money laundering legislation, we are obliged to make refunds exclusively to the same bank or credit card account used for the original purchase.\nIf the credit card is no longer valid, the cardholder must contact the issuing bank and request a chargeback.\nThe bank will then return the original transaction to us through the service provider.\nThe right of withdrawal from the contract is in all cases subject to the following conditions, in addition to those laid out in Section 10.\nIn summary, your right to withdraw from the contract is designed to replicate the process of examining a product in a physical shop.\n\u2022 The product (brand new or refurbished) must be returned in the condition that it was received, and complete with any documentation, instructions and accessories that it came with.\nAny tags, labels or screen protector films that were attached to it when it was supplied must not have been removed.\n\u2022 The product must be returned in its original packaging, which must also be in the same condition as it was received and be complete with all its elements.\nAs a sole exception, if it is genuinely impossible to remove a product from its branded packaging without damaging the latter, this necessary damage to the packaging is acceptable.\nDo not write on the branded packaging, or attach labels or sticky tape to it.\n\u2022 You are responsible for ensuring that the product and its branded packaging is adequately prepared for shipping.\nThis means that it must be placed in crush resistant outer packaging, i.e.\na strong cardboard box with appropriate filler material within it.\nWe strongly recommend that you retain the outer packaging it was delivered in for this purpose, at least for the duration of the 30-day trial period.\n\u2022 The right of withdrawal applies only to the purchased product in its entirety.\nno withdrawal will be accepted for only part of the purchased product (other products ordered at the same time are not affected).\n\u2022 If you do not comply with these requirements, your right to receive a refund in exchange for returning the product is forfeited.\n(b) Products discovered to be defective on arrival\nIf a product appears to be defective on arrival, please contact our Customer Service department exclusively via&nbsp;<strong>the Support section</strong>&nbsp;of our website.\nThey may be able to remedy the situation by providing you with additional information.\nBeyond that, you have the right to return the product within 30 days of receipt, under the same conditions described in Section 7A (e.g.\nthe product and branded packaging must be complete and undamaged), and receive your choice of a replacement or a full refund.\nWe reserve the right to examine the product when we receive it in order to confirm that the fault is not caused by damage incurred after you received the product, and undertake to do this promptly.\nSee also the warranty terms in Section 9 below, which applies to products once they have been in the customer\u2019s possession for more than 30 days.\n________________________________________\n<strong>8.\nExchanges</strong>\nIf you decide that you would rather have a different product, please contact our Customer Service department exclusively via&nbsp;<u>\n<strong>the Support section</strong>\n</u>&nbsp;of our website,&nbsp;as soon as possible.\nIf you let us know in time, we may be able to prevent the currently ordered product from being dispatched and send the different product instead.\nthis will be the quickest solution.\nIf you are not able to contact us in time, please refuse the delivery and immediately inform us that you have done this.\nThe courier will return the package to us and we shall arrange to send you your preferred product.\nIf you only decide that you would like a different product once you have examined the product initially ordered, you may return it to us within 30 days in accordance with the conditions described above.\nTell us what you would like instead and we shall send it to you instead of arranging a refund.\nYou will not have to pay extra delivery costs.\n________________________________________\n<strong>9.\nWarranty terms</strong>\na) Duration\nAll new products purchased from authorised dealers or via the Punkt.\nwebsite come with a two-year Punkt.\nguarantee.\nThe warranty on units sold as \u201crefurbished\u201d covers a period of one year.\nIn the event of a product being repaired or replaced by Punkt.\nunder warranty, the warranty period is extended to match the length of time that it takes for the issue to be resolved.\nIn cases where a product has been repaired by or on behalf of Punkt.\nother than under warranty (e.g.\naccidental damage or when the warranty has expired), the repair work comes with a six month warranty.\nIf the product is still within the warranty from its purchase, this is unaffected.\nAll warranty periods commence from the date upon which the Customer receives the product.\nIn determining this date, reliance will be made upon the delivery date stated by the courier.\n&nbsp.\nb) Limitation of cover\nThe warranty will be voided by any inappropriate use, and/or any modification, manipulation or repair other than those carried out by or expressly authorised by Punkt.\nThe warranty only covers problems caused by manufacturing defects.\nit does not apply to problems caused by other factors such as misuse, accidental damage (e.g.\ndropping the product or allowing water ingress beyond its stated water-resistance capacity), inappropriate electrical supply, extreme environmental conditions (e.g.\nhumidity, high temperatures), or any other use that is not in accordance with the product\u2019s instruction manual and associated literature).\nc) Claims\nIf you need to make a warranty claim, please make a support request on the Support section of our website<u>\n<strong>&nbsp;here</strong>\n</u>.\nUsing other forms of communication will mean that it takes us longer to deal with your claim.\nYou will be asked to provide, among other information, the original order number (if the product was purchased directly from us) or proof of purchase (if it was bought elsewhere), the serial number of the product and a detailed description of the problem.\nThe serial number can be found on the product\u2019s original packaging.\nOur Customer Service team will then normally contact you within three working days.\n(It may take a little longer at peak times, e.g.\nat Christmas, after new product launches and during promotional campaigns.)\nImportant: Please do not return any product under warranty until you have been requested to do so by Punkt.\nDoing so will cause delays in processing your claim.\nThe parcel is likely to arrive with unnecessary taxes and/or import duty to pay.\nif you return a product without following the procedure specified by us, you undertake to reimburse us for these charges.\nWe shall send you an address label that will prevent these charges from being applied.\nIf you have contacted us before the expiry date of the warranty period, and it is reasonable to say that the product has a manufacturing defect, we shall repair or replace it (at our choice) free of charge.\nIf the claim is made within six months of initial receipt of the product, it will be assumed that a problem is the result of a manufacturing defect unless the contrary can be demonstrated.\nafter six months it will be necessary to demonstrate that a problem is caused by a manufacturing defect.\nThe only situation in which we shall make a refund of the cost of a defective product is if you make a support request within 30 days from initial receipt of the goods, as described in Section 7 above.\n________________________________________\n<strong>10.\nProcedure for returning a product</strong>\nIf you need to return a product to us, whether under your right of withdrawal from the purchase contract or as part of a claim under warranty, please follow these instructions carefully in order to avoid unnecessary inconvenience and expense.\nThe system described below ensures that a) the goods are sent to the correct location.\nb) they are conveyed in the most efficient way.\nand c) we are able to process them much more quickly once they reach us.\n\u2022 Contact us before dispatching the product.\nDo this by accessing your account on punkt.ch (or by creating a new account, if this was not done at the time of purchase) and opening a support request in the&nbsp;<u>\n<strong>Support section</strong>\n</u>&nbsp;of the website.\nYou will be asked to provide, among other information, the order number, the serial number of the product and a detailed description of the reason for the return.\nAssuming everything is in order, we shall then provide you with a Return Merchandise Authorisation (RMA) number.\nPlease do not return a product without prior approval from us.\n\u2022 Use the prepaid label enclosed with the product, and its associated courier, unless we ask you to do otherwise.\nThis will ensure that the parcel goes to the correct distribution centre, is conveyed in the most cost-effective manner, and avoids unnecessary customs duties and taxes.\nWrite the RMA number clearly on a piece of paper and include it inside the parcel.\nIf you no longer have the prepaid return label please contact us and we shall issue you with a replacement.\n\u2022 Ensure that the product is adequately packed.\nYou are liable for any damage in transit that can be shown to be due to inadequate packing.\nPlease retain the original packaging for this purpose.\n\u2022 Remember to enclose all accessories.\nIf you are returning the product because you wish to withdraw from the purchase, remember that it needs to be returned in a saleable condition.\nwe reserve the right to reduce or cancel your refund if it is damaged and/or accessories are missing.\n&nbsp.\nIf a product is sent to us without following these instructions, it will almost certainly arrive with substantial import duty/tax to pay.\nIf you do return a product without following the procedure specified by us, you undertake to reimburse us for these charges.\nAlso, the unlikely event that the parcel arrives at the correct site and without import duty/tax payable, we shall only be able to refund your shipping costs up to what we would have paid our own courier.\nbecause we have a wholesale contract with them, this will be considerably less than a one-off arrangement that you are likely to make.\n________________________________________\n<strong>11.\nData protection</strong>\nWe encourage you to read our<u>\n<strong>&nbsp;Data Protection Policy</strong>\n</u>, which includes use of the Punkt.\ne-shop.\nIt provides information about how and for what purposes we collect and use your personal data.\n&nbsp.\n________________________________________\n<strong>12.\nLimitation of liability</strong>\nUnder no circumstances will Punkt.\nbe liable for any incidental, special or consequential loss arising out or related to this agreement.\nIn the event of Punkt.\nbeing held liable for any loss related to this agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy will be the full refund of your purchase price without interest.\n________________________________________\n<strong>13.\nGoverning law and jurisdiction</strong>\nThe contract between the Customer and Punkt.\nis made exclusively under Swiss law, and in the event of disputes, Swiss laws will be applicable.\nAny dispute, deriving from or in any way related to these terms and conditions will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Lugano, Switzerland.\n________________________________________\n<strong>14.\nForce majeure</strong>\nPunkt.\nis exempt from all liability for the total or partial non-fulfilment of any contractual obligations where that non-fulfilment is caused by unforeseeable events beyond the control and responsibility of Punkt.\nincluding, by way of example but without limitation, natural events, pandemics, epidemics, acts of terrorism, wars, civil uprisings, malfunctioning of connectivity, electricity shortages, general strikes by public and/or private workers, strikes and/or restrictions on road access by/for couriers, and air connections.\n________________________________________\n<strong>15.\nMiscellaneous</strong>\nIf any one of these general terms and conditions proves to be invalid or becomes invalid at a later date, this will not affect the validity of the rest of the contract.\nIn such a case, the invalid term will be replaced with a term that represents as closely as possible its intention and financial purpose and/or with the appropriate legal provisions.\nTherefore, the parties agree and accept that the invalidity of a term and/or condition is not grounds for cancelling or invalidating the agreement as they declare that this is without prejudice to good faith in the implementation of the contract and the fact that the parties could not reasonably anticipate that invalidity at the time of entering into the agreement.\nPunkt.\nreserves the right to amend these general terms and conditions at any time.\nSuch amendments will be published as a replacement for or an addition to the terms &amp.\nconditions existing up to that time.\nIn the event of any inconsistency or discrepancy between the English version and any other language versions of these Terms &amp.\nConditions, the English language version shall prevail.\n&nbsp.\n<strong>Punkt.</strong> Punkt.<p>\n<small>Legal Notice | Terms &amp.\nConditions of sale | Data

website.\nThis continues to apply even if specific reference is made to the possibility of such damage.</p>\nInformation technology security\n<p>Please be aware of the danger arising from viruses or other malicious software (malware) or hacking attacks, phishing and the like.\nWe recommend that you use anti-virus software, anti-spam filters, a firewall and other methods to protect your system and that you take care to keep them up to date.\nWe are excluded from any responsibility for any manipulation made to your computer system by unauthorized persons in relation to access to our website.\n&nbsp.\nPhishing refers to malicious attempts to access confidential data, and it may come in various ways, including email, telephone, SMS text message or fax.\nAny request to disclose payment card data (e.g.\ncard number, expiry date) or any other sensitive information should be seen as a possible phishing attempt.\nThese requests can often appear extremely realistic.\nIf there are any grounds for doubt, do not respond, do not not click on any link within an email, and do not open any attachments that may be included.\nSuspicious emails or SMS text messages should be deleted immediately, and excluded/removed from any backups.\nIf you are in doubt about the genuineness of a request for sensitive information, contact us by telephone for confirmation on +41 91 924

of messages or documents that are transmitted by these means.\nAny time that you communicate personal information through an open network, you should be aware that third parties can potentially access this information and use it without your consent.\nThird parties can therefore detect debit/credit card activity or other business relationships.\n&nbsp.\nEven if the sender and the recipient are located in the same country, the transmission of data via electronic networks will inevitably have security vulnerabilities.\nalso, the transmission may be via other countries, including countries that do not offer the same level of data protection as Switzerland.\nYour data may be lost, or stolen by unauthorised third parties, during transmission.\nWe will not be liable for the security of your data during electronic transmission and we decline any responsibility for direct or indirect damage.\nPlease use other means of communication if you consider it necessary or reasonable for security reasons.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;</p>\nImportant copyright information\n<ul>\n<li>This website was designed to provide information to the public.\nAny illegal or improper use shall be liable to
