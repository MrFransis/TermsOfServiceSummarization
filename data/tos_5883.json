of Christian Rommes, Airportinfo.live use cookies.\nCookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.</p>\n<p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies.\nMany cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.\nA cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\nIt consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.\nThis allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain

uses cookies, e.g.\ndoes not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user\u00b4s computer

increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>\n5.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data\n<p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the

Facebook\n<p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook.\nFacebook is a social network.</p>\n<p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space.\nA social network may serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community to provide personal or business-related information.\nFacebook allows social network users to include the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.</p>\n<p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United States.\nIf a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>\n<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component.\nAn overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>\n<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject\u2014and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site\u2014which specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.\nThis information is collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the data subject.\nIf the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website, e.g.\nthe \"Like\" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>\n<p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the time of the call-up to our website.\nThis occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Facebook component or not.\nIf such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>\n<p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by Facebook.\nIn addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook offers to protect the privacy of the data subject.\nIn addition, different configuration options are made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook.\nThese applications may be used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p>\n8.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google AdSense\n<p>On this website, the controller has integrated Google AdSense.\nGoogle AdSense is an online service which allows the placement of advertising on third-party sites.\nGoogle AdSense is based on an algorithm that selects advertisements displayed on third-party sites to match with the content of the respective third-party site.\nGoogle AdSense allows an interest-based targeting of the Internet user, which is implemented by means of generating individual user profiles.\n</p>\n<p>The operating company of Google\u00b4s AdSense component is Alphabet Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>\n<p>The purpose of Google\u00b4s AdSense component is the integration of advertisements on our website.\nGoogle AdSense places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nWith the setting of the cookie, Alphabet Inc.\nis enabled to analyze the use of our website.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google AdSense component is integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google AdSense component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Alphabet Inc.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Alphabet Inc.\ngains knowledge of personal data, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Alphabet Inc., inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks and subsequently create commission settlements.\n</p>\n<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Alphabet Inc.\nfrom setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nAdditionally, cookies already in use by Alphabet Inc.\nmay be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Google AdSense also uses so-called tracking pixels.\nA tracking pixel is a miniature graphic that is embedded in web pages to enable a log file recording and a log file analysis through which a statistical analysis may be performed.\nBased on the embedded tracking pixels, Alphabet Inc.\nis able to determine if and when a website was opened by a data subject, and which links were clicked on by the data subject.\nTracking pixels serve, inter alia, to analyze the flow of visitors on a website.</p>\n<p>Through Google AdSense, personal data and information\u2014which also includes the IP address, and is necessary for the collection and accounting of the displayed advertisements\u2014is transmitted to Alphabet Inc.\nin the United States of America.\nThese personal data will be stored and processed in the United States of America.\nThe Alphabet Inc.\nmay disclose the collected personal data through this technical procedure to third parties.</p>\n<p>Google AdSense is further explained under the following link https://www.google.com/intl/en/adsense/start/.</p>\n9.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function)\n<p>On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).\nGoogle Analytics is a web analytics service.\nWeb analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.\nA web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.\nWeb analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>\n<p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy, Mountain View, CA 94043-1351, United States.</p>\n<p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application \"_gat.\n_anonymizeIp\".\nBy means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.\nGoogle uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.</p>\n<p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nWith the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>\n<p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.\nWith each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.\nThese personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\n</p>\n<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nIn addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>\n<p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.\nFor this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and install it.\nThis browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.\nThe installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.\nIf the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics.\nIf the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.</p>\n<p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ and under http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.\nGoogle Analytics is further explained under the following Link https://www.google.com/analytics/.</p>\n10.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Matomo\n<p>On this website, the controller has integrated the Matomo component.\nMatomo is an open-source software tool for web analysis.\nWeb analysis is the collection, gathering and evaluation of data on the behavior of visitors from Internet sites.\nA web analysis tool collects, inter alia, data on the website from which a data subject came to a website (so-called referrer), which pages of the website were accessed or how often and for which period of time a sub-page was viewed.\nA web analysis is mainly used for the optimization of a website and the cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.</p>\n<p>The software is operated on the server of the controller, the data protection-sensitive log files are stored exclusively on this server.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the Matomo component is the analysis of the visitor flows on our website.\nThe controller uses the obtained data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of this website in order to compile online reports, which show the activities on our Internet pages.</p>\n<p>Matomo sets a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nWith the setting of the cookie, an analysis of the use of our website is enabled.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this website, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically through the Matomo component prompted to submit data for the purpose of online analysis to our server.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, we obtain knowledge about personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves to understand the origin of visitors and clicks.</p>\n<p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which access was made, and the frequency of visits to our website.\nWith each visit of our Internet pages, these personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, are transferred to our server.\nThese personal data will be stored by us.\nWe do not forward this personal data to third parties.</p>\n<p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the used Internet browser would also prevent Matomo from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nIn addition, cookies already in use by Matomo may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.</p>\n<p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data relating to a use of this Internet site that are generated by Matomo as well as the processing of these data by Matomo and the chance to preclude any such.\nFor this, the data subject must set a \"Do Not Track\" option in the browser.</p>\n<p>With each setting of the opt-out cookie, however, there is the possibility that the websites of the controller are no longer fully usable for the data subject.</p>\n<p>Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Matomo may be retrieved under https://matomo.org/privacy/.</p>\n11.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Twitter\n<p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of Twitter.\nTwitter is a multilingual, publicly-accessible microblogging service on which users may publish and spread so-called \u2018tweets,\u2019 e.g.\nshort messages, which are limited to 280 characters.\nThese short messages are available for everyone, including those who are not logged on to Twitter.\nThe tweets are also displayed to so-called followers of the respective user.\nFollowers are other Twitter users who follow a user\u00b4s tweets.\nFurthermore, Twitter allows you to address a wide audience via hashtags, links or retweets.</p>\n<p>The operating company of Twitter is Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, UNITED STATES.</p>\n<p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and on which a Twitter component (Twitter button) was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download a display of the corresponding Twitter component of Twitter.\nFurther information about the Twitter buttons is available under https://about.twitter.com/de/resources/buttons.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, Twitter gains knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.\nThe purpose of the integration of the Twitter component is a retransmission of the contents of this website to allow our users to introduce this web page to the digital world and increase our visitor numbers.</p>\n<p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Twitter, Twitter detects with every call-up to our website by the data subject and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site which specific sub-page of our Internet page was visited by the data subject.\nThis information is collected through the Twitter component and associated with the respective Twitter account of the data subject.\nIf the data subject clicks on one of the Twitter buttons integrated on our website, then Twitter assigns this information to the personal Twitter user account of the data subject and stores the personal data.</p>\n<p>Twitter receives information via the Twitter component that the data subject has visited our website, provided that the data subject is logged in on Twitter at the time of the call-up to our website.\nThis occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Twitter component or not.\nIf such a transmission of information to Twitter is not desirable for the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Twitter account before a call-up to our website is made.</p>\n<p>The applicable data protection provisions of Twitter may be accessed under https://twitter.com/privacy?lang=en.</p>\n12.\nLegal basis for the processing <p>Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIs our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\nSuch processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nHe considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n</p>\n13.\nThe legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party\n<p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>\n14.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored\n<p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.\nAfter expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.</p>\n15.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.\nRequirement necessary to enter into a contract.\nObligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data <p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n</p>\n16.\nExistence of automated decision-making\n<p>As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.</p>\n<br> Imprint | Privacy settings |\nPrivacy\n| Terms of Service| Contact\nAll statements without guarantee.\nErrors and
