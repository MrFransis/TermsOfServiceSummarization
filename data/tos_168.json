Updated: October 30, 2020</p>\n<p>Thank you for using Airbnb!</p>\n<p>These Terms of Service (\u201c<strong>Terms</strong>\u201d) are a binding legal agreement between you and Airbnb that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the \u201c<strong>Airbnb Platform</strong>\u201d).\nWhen used in these Terms, \u201c<strong>Airbnb</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>we</strong>,\u201d \u201c<strong>us</strong>,\u201d or \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201d refers to the Airbnb entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.\n</p>\n<p>The Airbnb Platform offers an online venue that enables users (\u201c<strong>Members</strong>\u201d) to publish, offer, search for, and book services.\nMembers who publish and offer services are \u201c<strong>Hosts</strong>\u201d and Members who search for, book, or use services are \u201c<strong>Guests</strong>.\u201d Hosts offer accommodations (\u201c<strong>Accommodations</strong>\u201d), activities, excursions, and events (\u201c<strong>Experiences</strong>\u201d), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, \u201c<strong>Host Services</strong>,\u201d and each Host Service offering, a \u201c<strong>Listing</strong>\u201d).\nYou must register an account to access and use many features of the Airbnb Platform, and must keep your account information accurate.\nAs the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services.\nAirbnb is not a party to the contracts concluded directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker or insurer.\nAirbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (\u201c<strong>Payment Terms</strong>\u201d).\nTo learn more about Airbnb\u2019s role see Section 16.</p>\n<p>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our

belong anywhere.\nFrom cabins to castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of Listings to find the ones that fit the way you like to travel.\nLearn more about a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host profile, and Guest reviews.\nIf you have questions, just message the Host.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nSearching and Booking on Airbnb</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 Searching</strong>.\nYou can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests.\nYou can also use filters to refine your search results.\nSearch results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria.\nRelevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g.\nminimum or maximum nights), and more.\nLearn more about search results in our Help Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2 Booking</strong>.\nWhen you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Airbnb\u2019s service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, \u201c<strong>Total Price</strong>\u201d).\nYou are also agreeing that Airbnb Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout.\nWhen you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host.\nThe cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Host.\nBe aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Accommodation Reservations</strong>.\nAn Accommodation reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the Accommodation.\nThe Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law.\nIf you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties.\nYou may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services</strong>.\nAn Experience or other Host Service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service.\nYou are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements.\nYou are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend, or use the Host Service.\nExcept where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nCancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds</strong>.\nIn general, if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.\nBut, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you.\nIf something outside your control forces you to cancel a reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy.\nIf the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the Guest Refund Policy.\nDifferent policies apply to certain categories of Listings.\nfor example Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy.\nSee each Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2 Booking Modifications</strong>.\nGuests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf (\"<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>\"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nYour Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.1 Your Responsibilities</strong>.\nYou are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service.\nFor example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times.\nIf you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.2 Your Assumption of Risk</strong>.\n<strong>You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform and any Content (as defined in Section 10), including your stay at any Accommodation, participation in any Experience, use of any other Host Service, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online.\nThis means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Service to determine whether it is suitable for you.\nFor example, Host Services may carry risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Services.\n</strong>\n</p>Host Terms\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nHosting on Airbnb</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.1 Host</strong>.\nAs a Host, Airbnb offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it.\nIt\u2019s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 Contracting with Guests</strong>.\nWhen you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Airbnb Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing.\nYou are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Airbnb\u2019s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking.\nAirbnb Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.\nAny terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3 Independence of Hosts</strong>.\nYour relationship with Airbnb is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Airbnb, except that Airbnb Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms.\nAirbnb does not direct or control your Host Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nManaging Your Listing</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing</strong>.\nThe Airbnb Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing.\nYour Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing.\nYou are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times.\nWe recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions.\nYou may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay.\nAny offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations</strong>.\nYou are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services.\nFor example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays.\nSome cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties.\nSome jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle).\nIn some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether.\nSome jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation.\nSome jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts.\nFor example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays.\nCheck your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer.\nInformation we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations.\nYou are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards.\nIf you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3 Search Ranking</strong>.\nThe ranking of Listings in search results on the Airbnb Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guest search parameters (e.g.\nnumber of Guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),</li>\n<li>Listing characteristics (e.g.\nprice, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, Host status, age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),</li>\n<li>Guest booking experience (e.g.\ncustomer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking), </li>\n<li>Host requirements (e.g.\nminimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and</li>\n<li>Guest preferences (e.g.\nprevious trips, saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website.\nAirbnb may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform by paying an additional fee.\nMore information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any), and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4 Your Responsibilities</strong>.\nYou are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services.\nYou are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing.\nYou must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Airbnb Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy.\nDo not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Airbnb Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization</strong>.\nIf you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host Services is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms.\nIf you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established.\nIf you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions.\nIf you instruct Airbnb to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or to send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.6 Your Assumption of Risk</strong>.\n<strong>You acknowledge that hosting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Airbnb Platform, offering Host Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online.\nYou agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the Airbnb Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Host Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by Airbnb.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nCancellations, Travel Issues, and Booking Modifications</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues</strong>.\nIn general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.\nAs a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law.\nIf you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences.\nIf: (i) a Guest experiences a Travel Issue (as defined by the Guest Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation.\nIf a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Airbnb exceeds your payout, Airbnb (via Airbnb Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts.\nYou agree that Airbnb\u2019s Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests.\nIf we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made.\nIf you Host an Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your reservations.\nSee each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.2 Booking Modifications</strong>.\nHosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nTaxes</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.1 Host Taxes</strong>.\nAs a host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes (\"<strong>Taxes</strong>\").\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2 Collection and Remittance by Airbnb</strong>.\nIn jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize Airbnb to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority.\nAny Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by Airbnb are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable.\nAirbnb may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members\u2019 tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Airbnb is a refund from the applicable Tax authority.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3 Tax Information</strong>.\nIn certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both.\nIf you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided.\nYou agree that Airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by you, our Guests, and/or their organizations.</p>General Terms\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nReviews</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>After each Host Service, Guests and Hosts will have an opportunity to review each other.\nYour Review must be accurate and may not contain any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our Content Policy or Review Policy.\nReviews are not verified by Airbnb for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nContent</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Parts of the Airbnb Platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos, audio, video, information, and other content (collectively, \u201c<strong>Content</strong>\u201d).\nBy providing Content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant Airbnb a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable and transferable license to copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish and otherwise exploit, that Content, without limitation.\nIf Content includes personal information, our Privacy Policy describes how we use that personal information.\nWhere Airbnb pays for the creation of Content or facilitates its creation, Airbnb may own that Content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say that.\nYou are solely responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you either own it or are authorized to grant Airbnb the rights described in these Terms.\nYou are responsible and liable if any of your Content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party.\nContent must comply with our Content Policy and Nondiscrimination Policy, which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent, and illegal content.\nYou agree that Airbnb may make available services or automated tools to translate Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or tools.\nAirbnb does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of translations and Members are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such translations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nFees</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Airbnb may charge fees (and applicable Taxes) to Hosts and Guests for use of the Airbnb Platform.\nMore information about when service fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our Service Fees page.\nExcept as otherwise provided on the Airbnb Platform, service fees are non-refundable.\nAirbnb reserves the right to change the service fees at any time, and will provide Members notice of any fee changes before they become effective.\nFee changes will not affect bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change.\nIf you disagree with a fee change you may terminate this agreement at any time pursuant to Section 13.2.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nAirbnb Platform Rules</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.1

doing on the Airbnb Platform, Schedule 1 below sets out the Airbnb entity with whom you are contracting.\nIf we identify through the Airbnb Platform, an Airbnb entity other than the one set out on Schedule 1 as being responsible for a product, feature or transaction, the Airbnb entity so identified is your contracting entity with respect to that product, feature or transaction.\nIf you change your country of residence or establishment, the Airbnb company you contract with (as set out on Schedule 1) and the applicable version of the Terms of Service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment, from the date on which your country of residence or establishment changes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>22.\nUnited States Governing Law and Venue</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>If you reside or have your place of establishment in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions.\nJudicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the arbitration agreement in Section 23 must be brought in state or federal court in San Francisco, California, unless we both agree to some other location.\nYou and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in San Francisco, California.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.\nUnited States Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.1 Application</strong>.\nThis Arbitration Agreement only applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States.\nIf your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Airbnb in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this Section 23 applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</strong>.\nAirbnb is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process.\nTo that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Section 23 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Airbnb\u2019s customer service team (described in paragraph 23.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d).\nYou and Airbnb each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</strong>.\nAt least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Airbnb each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution.\nYou must send your notice of dispute to Airbnb by mailing it to Airbnb\u2019s agent for service: <strong>CSC Lawyers Incorporating Service, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, California 95833</strong>.\nAirbnb will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Airbnb account.\nA notice of dispute must include: the party\u2019s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at www.adr.org).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.4 Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.\n<strong>You and Airbnb mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the Airbnb Platform, Host Services, or any Content (collectively, \u201c</strong>Disputes<strong>\u201d) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the \u201c</strong>Arbitration Agreement<strong>\u201d).\nIf there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Airbnb agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</strong>.\nYou and Airbnb each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as defined by Section 22): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.\n(ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).\nor (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief.\nYou and Airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</strong>.\nThis Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThe arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201c) then in effect, except as modified here.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org.\nIn order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at www.adr.org) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</strong>.\nIn order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Airbnb agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S.\ncounty where you reside.\n(b) in San Francisco County.\n(c) via phone or video conference.\nor (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</strong>.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.\nIf such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Airbnb will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\nEither party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.9 Arbitrator\u2019s Decision</strong>.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.10 Jury Trial Waiver</strong>.\nYou and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</strong>.\nYou and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding.\nUnless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIn the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.12 Severability</strong>.\nExcept as provided in Section 23.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.\nIf Airbnb changes this Section 23 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective.\nRejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Airbnb.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>23.14 Survival</strong>.\nExcept as provided in Section 23.12 and subject to Section 13.6, this Section 23 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Airbnb Platform or terminate your Airbnb account.<br>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.\nChina Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.1 China

Tribunal shall consist of three (3) arbitrators.\nThe language of the arbitration shall be English.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.3 Without Limitation Provisions</strong>.\nThe above Sections 24.1 and 24.2

requiring you to perform or be prohibited from performing certain acts and other provisional relief permitted under the laws of Singapore, the People\u2019s Republic of China, or any other laws that may apply to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>25.\nRest of World Dispute Resolution, Venue and Forum, and Governing Law</strong>.\nIf you reside or have your place of establishment outside of the United

create a world where you can belong anywhere.\nFrom cabins to castles to cooking classes, browse through millions of Listings to find the ones that fit the way you like to travel.\nLearn more about a Listing by reviewing the description and photos, the Host profile, and past Guest reviews.\nIf you have questions, just message the Host.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nSearching and Booking on Airbnb</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.1 Searching</strong>.\nYou can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests.\nYou can also use filters to refine your search results.\nSearch results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria.\nRelevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g.\nminimum or maximum nights), and more.\nLearn more about search results in our Help Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.2 Booking</strong>.\nWhen you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Airbnb\u2019s service fee, offline fees, taxes and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, \u201c<strong>Total Price</strong>\u201d).\nYou are also agreeing that Airbnb Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout.\nWhen you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Host.\nThe cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Host.\nBe aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.3 Accommodation Reservations</strong>.\nAn Accommodation reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy and use the Accommodation.\nThe Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law.\nIf you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties.\nYou may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.4 Reservations for Experiences and Other Host Services</strong>.\nAn Experience or other Host Service reservation entitles you to participate in, attend, or use that Host Service.\nYou are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite, meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness or other requirements.\nYou are responsible for informing the Host of any medical or physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your ability to participate, attend or use the Host Service.\nExcept where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to join a Host Service unless they are included as an additional guest during the booking process.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nCancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds</strong>.\nIn general, if you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.\nBut, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you.\nIf something outside your control requires you to cancel a reservation, you may be entitled to a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy.\nIf the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be entitled to rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under our Guest Refund Policy.\nDifferent policies apply to certain categories of Listings.\nfor example Experiences reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy.\nSee each Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.\nYou may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.2 Booking Modifications</strong>.\nHosts and Guests are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf (\"<strong>Booking Modifications</strong>\"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nYour Responsibilities</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation or Experience.\nFor example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect and comply with applicable laws at all times.\nIf you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Host Terms</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nHosting on Airbnb</strong>.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.1 Host</strong>.\nAs a Host, Airbnb offers you the opportunity to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it.\nIt\u2019s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 Contracting with Guests</strong>.\nWhen you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Airbnb Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering the Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing.\nYou are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Airbnb\u2019s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking.\nAirbnb Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method.\nAny terms or conditions that you include in any supplement contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3 Independence of Hosts</strong>.\nYour relationship with Airbnb is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Airbnb, except that Airbnb Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms.\nAirbnb does not direct or control your Host Service and you understand that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services and at what price and on what terms to offer them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nManaging Your Listing</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing</strong>.\nThe Airbnb Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing.\nYour Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, security deposits, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing.\nYou are responsible for your acts and omissions as well as for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times.\nWe recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions like coverage details and exclusions.\nYou may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay.\nAny offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations</strong>.\nYou are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services.\nFor example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays.\nSome cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties.\nSome jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours or operating a vehicle).\nIn some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether.\nSome jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation.\nSome jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts.\nFor example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays.\nCheck your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer.\nInformation we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations.\nYou are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards.\nIf you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3 Search Ranking</strong>.\nThe ranking of Listings in search results on the Airbnb Platform depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guest search parameters (e.g.\nnumber of Guests, time and duration of the trip, price range),</li>\n<li>Listing characteristics (e.g.\nprice, calendar availability, number and quality of images, Reviews, type of Host Service, host status, age of the Listing, average Guest popularity),</li>\n<li>Guest booking experience (e.g.\ncustomer service and cancellation history of the Host, ease of booking), </li>\n<li>Host requirements (e.g.\nminimum or maximum nights, booking cut-off time), and</li>\n<li>Guest preferences (e.g.\nprevious trips, saved Listings, location from where the Guest is searching).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Search results may appear different on our mobile application than they appear on our website.\nAirbnb may allow Hosts to promote their Listings in search or elsewhere on the Airbnb Platform by paying an additional fee.\nMore information about the factors that determine how your Listing appears in search results, our current promotional programs (if any) and how we identify promoted Content can be found in our Help Center.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.4 Your Responsibilities</strong>.\n<strong>You are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Host Services.\nYou are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing.\nYou must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Airbnb Platform except those expressly authorized by our Offline Fee Policy.\nDo not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Airbnb Platform in violation of our Off-Platform Policy.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.5 Hosting as a Team or Organization</strong>.\nIf you work with a co-host or host as part of a team, business or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Host Services, is responsible and liable as a Host under these Terms.\nIf you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established.\nIf you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions.\nIf you instruct Airbnb to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-host or other Hosts, or send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nCancellations, Travel Issues, and Booking Modifications</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues</strong>.\nIn general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation.\nAs a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy or applicable law.\nIf you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences.\nIf: (i) a Guest experiences a Travel Issue (as defined by the Guest Refund Policy), (ii) an Extenuating Circumstance arises, or (iii) a reservation is cancelled under Section 13 of these Terms, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation.\nIf a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Airbnb exceeds your payout, Airbnb (via Airbnb Payments) may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts.\nYou agree that Airbnb\u2019s Guest Refund Policy, Extenuating Circumstances Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests.\nIf we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made.\nIf you Host an Experience please note that the Experience Cancellation Policy, Experiences Guest Refund Policy and different cancellation fees and consequences apply to your reservations.\nSee each Policy for details about what is covered, and what your payout will be in each situation.\nYou may appeal a decision by Airbnb by contacting our customer service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.2 Booking Modifications</strong>.\nHosts and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Airbnb Platform or direct Airbnb customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nTaxes</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.1 Host Taxes</strong>.\nAs a host, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income or other taxes (\"<strong>Taxes</strong>\").\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2 Collection and Remittance by Airbnb</strong>.\nIn jurisdictions where Airbnb facilitates the collection and/or remittance of Taxes on behalf of Hosts, you instruct and authorize Airbnb to collect Taxes on your behalf, and/or to remit such Taxes to the relevant Tax authority.\nAny Taxes that are collected and/or remitted by Airbnb are identified to Members on their transaction records, as applicable.\nAirbnb may seek additional amounts from Members (including by deducting such amounts from future payouts) in the event that the Taxes collected and/or remitted are insufficient to fully discharge that Members\u2019 tax obligations, and you agree that your sole remedy for Taxes collected by Airbnb is a refund from the applicable Tax authority.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we retain the right, with prior notice to affected Members, to cease the collection and remittance of Taxes in any jurisdiction for any reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.3 Tax Information</strong>.\nIn certain jurisdictions, Tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report Tax information about you, or withhold Taxes from payouts to you, or both.\nIf you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient to support any such obligation to withhold Taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until sufficient documentation is provided.\nYou agree that Airbnb may issue on your behalf invoices or similar documentation for VAT, GST, consumption or other Taxes for your Host Services to facilitate accurate tax reporting by our Guests and their organizations.</p>General Terms\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nReviews</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>After each Host Service, Guests and Hosts will have an opportunity to review each other.\nYour Review must be accurate and may not contain any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our Content Policy or Review Policy.\nReviews are not verified by Airbnb for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nContent</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Parts of the Airbnb Platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos, audio, video, information and other content (\u201c<strong>Content</strong>\u201d).\nBy providing Content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant Airbnb

works of, distribute, publish, transmit, stream, broadcast, and otherwise exploit in any manner such Content to provide and/or promote the Airbnb Platform, in any media or platform, known or unknown to date and in particular on Internet and social networks.\nIf Content includes personal information, such Content will only be used for these purposes if such use complies with applicable data protection laws in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nWhere Airbnb pays for the creation of Content or facilitates its creation, Airbnb may own that Content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say that.\nYou are solely responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you either own it or are authorized to grant Airbnb the rights described in these Terms.\nYou are responsible and liable if any of your Content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party.\nContent must comply with our Content Policy and Nondiscrimination Policy, which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent and illegal content.\nYou agree that Airbnb may make available services or automated tools to translate Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or tools.\nAirbnb does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of translations and Members are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such translations.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nFees</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Airbnb may charge fees (and applicable Taxes) to Hosts and Guests for use of the Airbnb Platform.\nMore information about when service fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our Service Fees page.\nExcept as otherwise provided on the Airbnb Platform, service fees are non-refundable.\nAirbnb reserves the right to change the service fees at any time, and will provide Members notice of any fee changes before they become effective.\nFee changes will not affect bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change.\nIf you disagree with a fee change you may terminate this agreement at any time pursuant to Section 13.2.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nAirbnb

participant in any contractual relationship between Members.\nAirbnb is not acting as an agent for any Member except for where Airbnb Payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.\nWhile we work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Airbnb, we do not and cannot control the conduct or performance of Guests and Hosts and do not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Listings or Host Services or (ii) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Reviews, or other Content provided by Members.\nYou acknowledge that Airbnb has no general obligation to monitor the use of the Airbnb Platform and verify information provided by our Members, but has the right to review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Airbnb Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes).\n(ii) ensure Members\u2019 compliance with these Terms.\n(iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body.\n(iv) address Member Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable.\n(v) take actions set out in these Terms.\nand (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don\u2019t meet quality and eligibility criteria.\nWhere we remove or disable Content, we will notify a Member and provide the reasons for such a measure, unless such notification would (i) prevent or impede the detection or prevention of fraud or other illegal activities, (ii) harm the legitimate interests of other Members or third parties, or (iii) contravene applicable laws.\nYou may appeal such a decision by contacting our customer service.\nMembers agree to cooperate with and assist Airbnb in good faith, and to provide Airbnb with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Airbnb with respect to any investigation undertaken by Airbnb regarding the use or abuse of the Airbnb Platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nMember Accounts</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>You must

law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local

Host, Host Service, Listing or third party and we do not warrant that verification, identity or background checks conducted on Members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct.\nAny references to a Member being \"verified\" (or similar language) indicate only that the Member or Airbnb has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else.\nWe are not responsible for outages or disruptions of the Internet and telecommunications infrastructure which are beyond our control and can lead to interruptions in the availability of the Airbnb Platform.\nAirbnb may, temporarily and under consideration of the Members\u2019 legitimate interests (e.g.\nby providing prior notice), restrict the availability of the Airbnb Platform or

breaches of essential contractual obligations by us, our legal representatives, directors, or other vicarious agents Airbnb\u2019s liability is limited to the typically occurring foreseeable damages.\nEssential contractual obligations are such duties of Airbnb in whose proper fulfillment you regularly trust and must trust for the proper execution of the contract.\nAny additional liability of Airbnb is excluded.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>20.\nIndemnification</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Airbnb\u2019s option),

adequately caused by your culpable breach of a contractual obligation.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>21.\nContracting Entities</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>Based on your country of residence or establishment and what you are doing on the Airbnb Platform, Schedule 1 below sets out the Airbnb entity with whom you are contracting.\nIf we identify through the Airbnb Platform, an Airbnb entity other than the

version of the Terms of Service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment, from the date on which your country of residence or establishment

applies to you if your country of residence or establishment is the United States.\nIf your country of residence or establishment is not the United States, and you nevertheless attempt to bring any legal claim against Airbnb in the United States, this Arbitration Agreement will apply for determination of the threshold issue of whether this Section 24 applies to you, and all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrability, venue, and applicable law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.2 Overview of Dispute Resolution Process</strong>.\nAirbnb is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process.\nTo that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom this Section 24 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Airbnb\u2019s customer service team (described in paragraph 24.3, below), and if necessary (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<strong>AAA</strong>\u201d).\nYou and Airbnb each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an alternative to arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.3 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification</strong>.\nAt least 30 days prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Airbnb each agree to notify the other party of the dispute in writing and attempt in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution.\nYou must send your notice of dispute to Airbnb by mailing it to Airbnb\u2019s agent for service: <strong>CSC Lawyers Incorporating Service, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, California 95833</strong>.\nAirbnb will send its notice of dispute to the email address associated with your Airbnb account.\nA notice of dispute must include: the party\u2019s name and preferred contact information, a brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought.\nIf the parties are unable to resolve the dispute within the 30-day period, only then may either party commence arbitration by filing a written Demand for Arbitration (available at www.adr.org) with the AAA and providing a copy to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules (available at www.adr.org).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.4 Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>You and Airbnb mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the applicability, breach, termination, validity, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or any use of the Airbnb Platform, Host Services, or any Content (collectively, \u201c</strong>Disputes<strong>\u201d) will be settled by binding individual arbitration (the \u201c</strong>Arbitration Agreement<strong>\u201d).\nIf there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Airbnb agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.</strong>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.5 Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement</strong>.\nYou and Airbnb each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as defined by Section 22 of the Terms of Service for Non-European Users): (i) any claim or cause of action alleging actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.\n(ii) any claim or cause of action seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).\nor (iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief.\nYou and Airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.6 Arbitration Rules and Governing Law</strong>.\nThis Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of this provision.\nThe arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or other AAA arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the \u201c<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\u201c) then in effect, except as modified here.\nThe AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org.\nIn order to initiate arbitration, a completed written demand (available at www.adr.org) must be filed with the AAA and provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.7 Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location</strong>.\nIn order to make the arbitration most convenient to you, Airbnb agrees that any required arbitration hearing may be conducted, at your option: (a) in the U.S.\ncounty where you reside.\n(b) in San Francisco County.\n(c) via phone or video conference.\nor (d) if all parties agree, by solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.8 Modification of AAA Rules - Attorney\u2019s Fees and Costs</strong>.\nYour arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.\nIf such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Airbnb will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.\nEither party may make a request that the arbitrator award attorneys\u2019 fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim or defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.9 Arbitrator\u2019s Decision</strong>.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction.\nThe arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.10 Jury Trial Waiver</strong>.\nYou and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.11 No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</strong>.\nYou and Airbnb acknowledge and agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney general action, or any other representative or consolidated proceeding.\nUnless we agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of the waiver contained in this paragraph as to any claim, cause of action or requested remedy, then that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, and only that claim, cause of action or requested remedy, will be severed from this agreement to arbitrate and will be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction.\nIn the event that a claim, cause of action or requested remedy is severed pursuant to this paragraph, then you and we agree that the claims, causes of action or requested remedies that are not subject to arbitration will be stayed until all arbitrable claims, causes of action and requested remedies are resolved by the arbitrator.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.12 Severability</strong>.\nExcept as provided in Section 24.11, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision will be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.13 Changes to Agreement to Arbitrate</strong>.\nIf Airbnb changes this Section 24 after the date you last accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject that change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date the change is effective.\nRejecting a new change, however, does not revoke or alter your prior consent to any earlier agreements to arbitrate any Dispute between you and Airbnb (or your prior consent to any subsequent changes thereto), which will remain in effect and enforceable as to any Dispute between you and Airbnb.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>24.14 Survival</strong>.\nExcept as provided in Section 24.12, and subject to Section 13.6 of the Terms of Service for Non-European Users this Section 24 will survive any termination of these Terms and will continue to apply even if you stop using the Airbnb Platform or terminate your Airbnb Account.</p>\nAdditional Terms Applicable to Business Users\n<p>If you are a <strong>Business User</strong> as defined in Section 25 of these Terms, the following additional terms will apply to you:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>25.\nBusiness Users</strong>.\n</p>\n<p>You are a \u201c<strong>Business User</strong>\u201d for the purposes of these Terms

that you are a Business User by adding your business details to your Airbnb account.\nYou are responsible for keeping your business details accurate and up to date.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>26.\nTermination, Suspension and other Measures.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In case we take any of the measures according to Section 13.2 and 13.3, you will be given the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances leading to such a measure in the framework of our internal complaint-handling process as described in Section 27.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>27.\nComplaints Handling and Mediation.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We want to be transparent about how we handle complaints and aim to treat all Business Users fairly.\nOur Help Center explains how you can access our internal complaint-handling system and what you can expect as a Business User when you make a complaint in relation to issues falling under the remit of Article 11 (1) of the Platform to Business Regulation.\nIt also sets out the details of the mediation service that you can use in the event that such a complaint is not resolved.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>28.\nAccess to Data.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Business Users have access to personal and other

their Host Services as well as aggregated information about searches, bookings and the performance of their listings.\nOur Privacy Policy sets out the categories of personal data and other data we collect, how we use, process, disclose and retain it, and how you can access it and exercise your data rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>29.\nAdditional Distribution Channels.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Airbnb

tracking urls are tiny graphic images and/or small blocks of code placed on website pages, ads, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you performed a specific action.\nWhen you access these pages, or when you open an email, let us know you have accessed the web page or opened the email.\nThese tools help us measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Server Logs and Other Technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We collect many different types of information from server logs and other technologies.\nFor example, we collect information about the device you use to access the Airbnb Platform, your operating system type, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.\nOur server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.\nAn IP address is a unique identifier that devices require to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet.\nWe may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to the Airbnb Platform and the website you visit after you leave the Airbnb Platform.\nThese tools help us improve user experience and deliver our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may use device-related information to authenticate users.\nFor example, we may use your IP address, browser information, or other data provided by your browser or device to identify the device being used to access our

target advertising.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Parties</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Third parties, including Facebook, place technologies such as pixels and SDKs on the Airbnb Platform.\nThese technologies (1) help us analyze how you use the Airbnb Platform, such as by noting the third party services from which you arrived, (2) market and advertise Airbnb services to you on the Airbnb Platform and third party websites, (3) help us detect or prevent fraud or conduct risk assessments, and (4) collect information about your activities on the Airbnb Platform, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on.\nFor example, to help us better understand how people use the Airbnb Platform, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics.\nTo prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser by clicking here.</p>\n<p>Third parties, including Facebook, may also use such tracking technologies to collect or receive information from the Airbnb Platform and elsewhere and use that information to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads both on the Airbnb Platform and on other websites and online services.\nTargeting and advertising cookies we use may include Google, and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time.\nSee here for information on how Google manages data in its ad products.\nFor more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit the Network

Google display network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.\nTo the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Airbnb Platform and you opt-out of tailored advertising, you may still receive advertising content.\nIn that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests.\nAlso, we do not control any of these opt-out links and are not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\nUsers can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting by updating their Facebook account ad settings and by contacting opt-out@airbnb.com with a description of your request and validation information.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Social Plugins</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Airbnb Platform may use social plugins provided

Platform.\nIf you are not logged into your account with the third party, then the third party may not know your identity.\nIf you are logged in to your account with the third party, then the third party may be able to link information or actions about your interactions with the Airbnb Platform to your account with them.\nPlease refer to the third party\u2019s privacy policies to learn more about its data practices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your Choices</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser\u2019s toolbar.\nWhile you may disable cookies through your browser settings, the Airbnb Platform currently does not respond to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal in the HTTP header from your browser or mobile application due to lack of standardization regarding how that signal should be interpreted.</p>\n<p>Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies.\nTo learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global

enable you to list or book Host Services in China and connect with Members in China, and vice versa.\nWhere required under law or if you have expressly granted permission, Airbnb China will disclose your information to Chinese government agencies without further notice to you.\nWe\u2019ll notify you in advance in specific situations where we apply any practices that differ from what is described in this Privacy Policy (including practices pertaining to disclosures to government agencies).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nOTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.1 Analyzing your Communications</strong>.</p>\n<p>We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Airbnb Platform for reasons outlined in the \u201cHow We Use Information We Collect\u201d section of this policy, including fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, analytics, enforcing our Terms of Service, and customer support purposes.\nFor example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other sites.\nIn some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings.\nWe use automated methods where reasonably possible.\nOccasionally we may need to manually review communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools.\nWe will not review, scan, or analyze your messaging communications to send third-party marketing messages to you and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.2 Linking Third-Party Accounts</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can link your Airbnb account with certain third-party services like social networks.\nYour contacts on these third-party services are referred to as \u201cFriends.\u201d When you direct the data sharing by creating this link:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>some of the information provided to us from linking accounts may be published on your public profile,</li>\n<li>your activities on the Airbnb Platform may be displayed to your Friends on the Airbnb Platform and/or that third-party service,</li>\n<li>a link to your public profile on that third-party service may be included in your Airbnb public profile,</li>\n<li>other Airbnb users may be able to see any Friends that you may have in common with them, or that you are a Friend of their Friend if applicable,</li>\n<li>other Airbnb users may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as listed on your linked social networking service,</li>\n<li>information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes, and</li>\n<li>publication and display of information that you provide to the Airbnb Platform through this linkage is subject to your settings and authorizations on the Airbnb Platform and the third-party service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>5.3 Third-Party Partners &amp.\nIntegrations</strong>.</p>\n<p>Parts of Airbnb may link to third-party services, not owned or controlled by Airbnb, such as Google Maps/Earth.\nUse of these services is subject to the privacy policies of those providers, such as Google Maps/Earth Additional Terms of Use, Google Privacy Policy (see here for more information on how Google uses information), and Citi Privacy Policy.\nAirbnb does not own or control these third parties and when you interact with them you are providing your information to them.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nYOUR RIGHTS</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can exercise any of the rights described in this section consistent with applicable law.\nSee here for information on data subject rights requests and how to submit a request.\nPlease note that we may ask you to verify your identity and request before taking further action on your request.</p>\n<p>Learn more about rights under GDPR here.</p>\n<p>If your country of residence is China, learn more about your rights here.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.1 Managing Your Information</strong>.</p>\n<p>You can access and update some of your personal information through your Account settings.\nIf you connected your Airbnb Account to a third-party service, like Facebook or Google, you can change your settings and unlink from that service in your Account settings.\nYou are responsible for keeping your personal information up to date.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2 Data Access and Portability</strong>.</p>\n<p>In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain copies of your personal information or information about how we handle your personal information, request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and/or request that we transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3 Data Erasure</strong>.</p>\n<p>In certain jurisdictions, you can request that your personal information be deleted.\nPlease note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may retain your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as prevention of money laundering, fraud detection and prevention, and enhancing safety.\nFor example, if we suspend an Airbnb Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain information from that Airbnb Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Airbnb Account in the future.</li>\n<li>We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations.\nFor example, Airbnb and Airbnb Payments may keep information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.</li>\n<li>Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) will continue to be publicly visible on Airbnb, even after your Airbnb Account is cancelled.\nHowever, attribution of such information to you will be removed.\nSome copies of your information (e.g., log records) will remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.</li>\n<li>Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>7.\nSECURITY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While no organization can guarantee perfect security, we are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nCHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with applicable law.\nIf we do so, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the top.\nIn case of material changes, we will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the effective date.\nIf you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you can cancel your Account.\nIf you do not cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access to or use of the Airbnb Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nCONTACT INFORMATION AND
