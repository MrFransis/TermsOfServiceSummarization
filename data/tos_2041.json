directly between participants\nand do not pass through any of our servers.\nVideo and audio\ntransmitted in the Service is then sent directly between the\nparticipants in a room and is encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) with\nclient-generated encryption keys.\nIn cases where a user is behind a\nstrict firewall or NAT, video and audio need to be relayed via a TURN\nserver, but end-to-end encryption is still maintained.</p>\n<p>If you have upgraded a room to PRO, you can choose to use \u201cLarge\nmeeting\u201d mode (up to 12 participants).\nCalls using \u201cLarge meeting\u201d\nmode will use a dedicated server infrastructure to allow more people\nin conversation, and better stability.\nYour stream will be sent\nthrough video router servers which transmits it to the other\nparticipants in the call, and also transmits their streams to\nyou.\nStreams will always be encrypted (DTLS-SRTP) in transit, but will\nbe decrypted and re-encrypted when passing through the video\nrouters.\nWe operate an infrastructure of video routers distributed\nacross the world, and you will be automatically routed to the closest\none.\nThe video router servers and all of our infrastructure adhere to\nstrict security measures, preventing any eavesdropping or interruption\nof the video/audio streams.</p>\nProviding your personal data to others\n<p>We may share information about with third
