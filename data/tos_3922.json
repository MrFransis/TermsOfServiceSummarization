Villamar, Director&nbsp;<br>Share Capital - \u20ac1,000,000.00</p>\n<p>For Users who live outside the European Union:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Humor Rainbow, Inc., a New York corporation<br>555 W.\n18th St.New York, NY 10011<br>Legal Representative \u2013 Sharmistha Dubey, CEO<br>Website Host \u2013 Humor Rainbow, Inc., a New York corporation<br>You may view the OkCupid Terms of Use here.</p>2.\nWHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by OkCupid.\nFor simplicity, we refer to all of these as our \u201cservices\u201d in this Privacy Policy.\nTo make it extra clear, we\u2019ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>\n<p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy.\nIf a particular service has its own privacy policy, then that policy \u2013 not this Privacy Policy \u2013 applies.</p>3.\nINFORMATION WE COLLECT<p>It goes without saying, we can\u2019t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such as basic profile details and the types of people you\u2019d like to meet.\nWe also collect information generated as you use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services through a social media account.\nIf you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information you give us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services.\nThis includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos.\nTo add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.\nSome of the information you choose to provide us may be considered \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201csensitive\u201d in certain jurisdictions, for example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs.\nBy choosing to provide this information, you consent to our processing of that information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit card number or other financial information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services, responses to our questions and testimonials.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use to register or enter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you contact our customer care team, we collect the information you give us during the interaction.\nSometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us in order to complete your request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the operation of the services.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information we receive from others</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Users.</strong> Other users may provide information about you as they use our services.\nFor instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us about you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media.</strong> You may be able to use your social media login (such asFacebook Login) to create and log into your OkCupid account.\nThis saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media account with us.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Partners.</strong> We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where OkCupid ads are published on a partner\u2019s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign\u2019s success).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Information collected when you use our services</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you\u2019ve used, how you\u2019ve used them and the devices you use to access our services.\nSee below for more details:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Usage Information.</strong> We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date and time you logged in, features you\u2019ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Device information.</strong> We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>hardware and software information such as IP address, device ID and type, device-specific and apps settings and characteristics, app crashes, advertising IDs (such as Google\u2019s AAID and Apple\u2019s IDFA, both of which are randomly generated numbers that you can reset by going into your device\u2019 settings), browser type, version and language, operating system, time zones, identifiers associated with cookies or other technologies that may uniquely identify your device or browser (e.g., IMEI/UDID and MAC address);</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>information on your wireless and mobile network connection, like your service provider and signal strength;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>information on device sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Other information with your consent.</strong> If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through various means, depending on the service and device you\u2019re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections.\nThe collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren\u2019t using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection.\nIf you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Similarly, if you consent, we may collect your photos and videos (for instance, if you want to publish a photo, video or streaming on the services).</p>4.\nCOOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES<p>We use and may allow others to use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., web beacons, pixels) to recognize you and/or your device(s).\nYou may read our Cookie Policy for more information on why we use them (such as authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features) and how you can better control their use, through your browser settings and other tools.</p>\n<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d (\" <strong>DNT</strong>\") feature that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked.\nIf a website that responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser\u2019s user.\nNot all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform.\nFor this reason, many businesses, including OkCupid, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>5.\nHOW WE USE INFORMATION<p>The main reason we use your information is to deliver and improve our services.\nAdditionally, we use your info to help keep you safe and to provide you with advertising that may be of interest to you.\nRead on for a more detailed explanation of the various reasons we use your information, together with practical examples.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>To administer your account and provide our services to you</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create and manage your account</li>\n<li>Provide you with customer support and respond to your requests</li>\n<li>Complete your transactions</li>\n<li>Communicate with you about our services, including order management and billing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To help you connect with other users</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Analyze your profile and that of other users to recommend meaningful connections</li>\n<li>Show users\u2019 profiles to one another</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To ensure a consistent experience across your devices</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Link the various devices you use so that you can enjoy a consistent experience of our services on all of them.\nWe do this by linking devices and browser data, such as when you log into your account on different devices or by using partial or full IP address, browser version and similar data about your devices to help identify and link them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To serve you relevant offers and ads</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administer sweepstakes, contests, discounts or other offers</li>\n<li>Develop, display and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our services and other sites</li>\n<li>Communicate with you by email, phone, social media or mobile device about products or services that we think may interest you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To improve our services and develop new ones</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Administer focus groups and surveys</li>\n<li>Conduct research and analysis of users\u2019 behavior to improve our services and content (for instance, we may decide to change the look and feel or even substantially modify a given feature based on users\u2019 behavior)</li>\n<li>Develop new features and services (for example, we may decide to build a new interests-based feature further to requests received from users).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To prevent, detect and fight fraud or other illegal or unauthorized activities</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address ongoing or alleged misbehavior on and off-platform</li>\n<li>Perform data analysis to better understand and design countermeasures against these activities</li>\n<li>Retain data related to fraudulent activities to prevent against recurrences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>To ensure legal compliance</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Comply with legal requirements</li>\n<li>Assist law enforcement</li>\n<li>Enforce or exercise our rights, for example our Terms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Provide our service to you</em>: Most of the time, the reason we process your information is to perform the contract that you have with us.\nFor instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections, we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, to make it viewable to other users and recommend other users to you.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Legitimate interests</em>: We may use your information where we have legitimate interests to do so.\nFor instance, we analyze users\u2019 behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers we think might interest you, and we process information for administrative, fraud detection and other legal purposes.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Consent</em>: From time to time, we may ask for your consent to use your information for certain specific reasons.\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ul>6.\nHOW WE SHARE INFORMATION<p>Since our goal is to help you make meaningful connections, the main sharing of users\u2019 information is, of course, with other users.\nWe also share some users\u2019 information with service providers and partners who assist us in operating the services, with other Match Group companies and, in some cases, legal authorities.\nRead on for more details about how your information is shared with others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With other users.</strong> You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your public profile).\nPlease be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that you\u2019re comfortable being publicly viewable since neither you nor we can control what others do with your information once you share it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about you, then it will be visible according to your settings.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With our service providers and partners.</strong> We use third parties to help us operate and improve our services.\nThese third parties assist us with various tasks, including data hosting and maintenance, analytics, customer care, marketing, advertising, payment processing and security operations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share information with partners who distribute and assist us in advertising our services.\nFor instance, we may share limited information on you in hashed, non-human readable form to advertising partners.</p>\n<p>We follow a strict vetting process prior to engaging any service provider or working with any partner.\nAll of our service providers and partners must agree to strict confidentiality obligations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>With other Match Group businesses.</strong> OkCupid is part of the Match Group family of businesses which, as of the date of this Privacy Policy, includes websites and apps such as Tinder, OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, Match, Meetic, BlackPeopleMeet, LoveScout24, OurTime, Pairs, ParPerfeito, and Twoo (for more details, click here).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We share your information with other Match Group companies to benefit you in two respects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for other Match Group companies to assist us in processing your information, as service providers, upon our instructions and on our behalf.\nAssistance provided by other Match Group companies may include technical processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance, customer care, marketing and targeted advertising, finance and accounting assistance, better understanding how our service is used and users\u2019 behavior to improve our service, securing our data and systems and fighting against spam, abuse, fraud, infringement and other wrongdoings.</li>\n<li>In order to improve your chances at building significant connections with others, we may make you visible on other Match Group services or allow you to benefit from cross-platform functionalities.\nWe will of course comply with applicable law and, where relevant, notify you of any such opportunity and allow you to agree or to refuse.\nExamples of such opportunities may include the creation of a new service within Match Group, addressing a specific demographic that we feel would be interesting to you based on your search criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may also share information with other Match Group companies for legitimate business purposes such as corporate audit, analysis and consolidated reporting as well as compliance with applicable laws.\nWe may also share user information with other Match Group companies to remove users who violate our terms of service, or have been reported for criminal activity and/or bad behavior.\nIn some instances, we may remove that user from all platforms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For corporate transactions.</strong> We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>When required by law.</strong> We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements.\n(ii) to assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law).\nor (iii) to protect the safety of any person.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To enforce legal rights.</strong> We may alsoshare information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit.\n(ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested parties.\n(iii) to enforce our agreements with you.\nand (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>With your consent or at your request.</strong> We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties.\nIn any such case, we will make it clear why we want to share the information.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may use and share non-personal information (meaning information that, by itself, does not identify who you are such as device information, general demographics, general behavioral data, geolocation in de-identified form), as well as personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, under any of the above circumstances.\nWe may also share this information with other Match Group companies and third parties (notably advertisers) to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our services and on websites or applications of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see.\nWe may combine this information with additional non-personal information or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form collected from other sources.\nMore information on our use of cookies and similar technologies can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p>7.\nCROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS<p>Sharing of information laid out in Section 6 sometimes involves cross-border data transfers, for instance to the United States of America and other jurisdictions.\nAs an example, where the service allows for users to be located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), their personal information is transferred to countries outside of the EEA.\nWe use standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission or other suitable safeguard to permit data transfers from the EEA to other countries.\nStandard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data, binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data.</p>8.\nYOUR RIGHTS<p>We want you to be in control of your information, so we have provided you with the following tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Access / Update tools in the service.\nTools and account settings that help you to access, rectify or delete information that you provided to us and that\u2019s associated with your account directly within the service.\nIf you have any question on those tools and settings, please contact our customer care team for help here.</li>\n<li>Device permissions.\nMobile platforms have permission systems for specific types of device data and notifications, such as phone book and location services as well as push notifications.\nYou can change your settings on your device to either consent or oppose the collection of the corresponding information or the display of the corresponding notifications.\nOf course, if you do that, certain services may lose full functionality.</li>\n<li>Deletion.\nYou can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want you to be aware of your privacy rights.\nHere are a few key points to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reviewing your information.\nApplicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability or variations of those terms).\nYou can request a copy of your personal information by putting in such a request here.</li>\n<li>Updating your information.\nIf you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion or object to its processing, please contact us here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another user.\nIf you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you received from him or her through our service, the other user will have to contact our Privacy Officer to provide their written consent before the information is released.</p>\n<p>Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to the processing of personal information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.\nFor instance, we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uninstall.\nYou can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall process for your device.\nIf you uninstall the app from your mobile device, the unique identifier associated with your device will continue to be stored.\nIf you re-install the application on the same mobile device, we will be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous transactions and activities.</li>\n<li>Accountability.\nIn certain countries, including in the European Union, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information.\nThe data protection authority you can lodge a complaint with notably may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or where we are established.</li>\n</ul>9.\nRESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA<p>If you are a California resident, you can request a notice disclosing the categories of personal information about you that we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year.\nTo request this notice, please submit your request here.\nPlease allow 30 days for a response.\nFor your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer such a request.</p>10.\nHOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION<p>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information.\nAs with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</p>\n<p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>\n<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security.\nIf you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately here.</p>\n<p>In order to ensure that our systems and your information are protected against unauthorized access, theft and loss, we implemented a bug bounty program.\nFor more information about our bug bounty program, please click here.</p>11.\nHOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION<p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in Section 5 and as permitted by applicable law.\nTo protect the safety and security of our users on and off our services, we implement a one-year safety retention window following account deletion.\nDuring this period, account information will be retained although the account will of course not be visible on the services anymore.</p>\n<p>In practice, we delete or anonymize your information upon deletion of your account (following the safety retention window) or after two years of continuous inactivity, unless:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>we must keep it to evidence our compliance with applicable law (for instance, records of consents to our Terms, Privacy Policy and other similar consents are kept for five years);</li>\n<li>there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep the relevant information until it is resolved.\nor</li>\n<li>the information must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users\u2019 safety and security.\nFor example, information may need to be kept to prevent a user who was banned for unsafe behavior or security incidents from opening a new account.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical constraints.</p>12.\nCHILDREN\u2019S PRIVACY<p>Our services are restricted to users who are 18 years of age or older.\nWe do not permit users under the age of 18 on our platform and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18.\nIf you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting mechanism available through the service.</p>13.\nPRIVACY POLICY CHANGES<p>Because we\u2019re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections, this policy may change over time.\nWe will notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.</p>14.\nHOW TO CONTACT US<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, here\u2019s how you can reach
