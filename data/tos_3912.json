other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.\nPlease be advised that Drawboard reserves the right to transfer your data (including personal data) to and from any country, including Australia and the United States of America.\nWe do this in order to provide high performance of our products and services, and also to process data

GDPR, whether a country outside the European Union offers an adequate level of data protection by making an \u2018adequacy decision\u2019.\nTo date, the European Commission has not adopted an adequacy decision in respect of Australia.\nInstead, we rely on other legal bases to lawfully transfer personal data around the world (including transfers to countries like Australia where an adequacy decision has not been adopted).\nThese bases include your consent and the European Commission-approved model contractual clauses, which require certain privacy and security protections.\nYou may obtain a copy of the model contractual clauses by contacting us in accordance with the \u2018Contact us\u2019 section.</p> Links to Other Sites and Services <p>Our services may contain links to other websites and services.\nThe fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party.</p>\n<p>We do not exercise control over third party websites or services, and are not responsible for their actions.\nOther websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal data you submit to them.\nWe encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit and services you use.</p> Voluntary Public Disclosure of Personal Information <p>We may make available on our site, or link to, certain opportunities for our customers and other users to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.).</p>\n<p>Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others.\nWe have no control over,

unsolicited messages from other parties.</p> Changing or Deleting your Information <p>All Bullclip account holders may access, review, update, rectify or delete their personal data in their profile by

information may remain in archived/backup copies for legal reasons or to prevent harm, including as described in our \u2018Who do we disclose information to?\u2019 section.</p>\n<p>You may also contact us directly to receive (in a commonly used file format) the personal data you have provided to us.</p>\n<p>We may limit or reject your request in certain cases, including without limitation where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, where the rights of other persons would be violated, or as required by law.</p>\n<p>We will respond to all requests within 30 days.</p>\n<p>If you need further assistance regarding your access and control of your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>If you reside in a Designated Country and are unhappy with our data practices, you also have a right to lodge a complaint

information is only available to those employees who need it to perform their jobs.</p>\n<p>No method of transmission over the Internet using industry standard technology is 100% secure.\nTherefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.</p>\n<p>For more information, please see the Drawboard Approach to Security document at www.drawboard.com/terms.</p> Data Retention <p>We keep your account information, like your name and email address, for as long as your account is in existence because we need it to operate the accounts you have with us.\nWe keep other data, including information about how you use our products and services, until you request that we delete this data because we use this data to provide our products and services to you and for the other purposes set out in the \u2018How we use Personal Data\u2019 section above.</p> Privacy Policy Changes <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time.\nWe encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.\nIf we make material changes to this Privacy Policy you will be notified via email (if &nbsp;we have your contact information) or otherwise in some manner through the Services that we deem reasonably likely to reach you (which may include posting a new Privacy Policy on our website \u2013 or a specific announcement on this page
