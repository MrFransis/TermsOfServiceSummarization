distributors) made available online, through any mobile device, by email, or by telephone.\nBy accessing, browsing, and using our (mobile) website or any of our applications through whatever platform (hereafter collectively referred to as the \"Platform\") and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood, and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).</p>\n<p>These pages, the content, and infrastructure of these pages and the online reservation service (including the facilitation of payment service) provided by us on these pages and through the website are owned, operated, and provided by Booking.com B.V.\nand are provided for your personal, non-commercial (B2C) use only, subject to the terms and conditions set out below.\nThe relationship that we have with the Trip Providers are governed by separate terms and conditions which govern the (B2B) commercial relationship we have with each of these Trip Providers.\nEach Trip Provider acts in a professional manner vis-\u00e0-vis Booking.com when making its product and/or service available on or through Booking.com (both for its business-to-business (\"B2B\") and/or business-to-consumer (\"B2C\") relationship).\nNote that Trip Providers may have, declare applicable, and/or require (acceptance of) \u2013 in addition to the policies and fine print as disclosed on the website, their own (delivery/shipping/carriage/usage) terms and conditions and house rules for the use, access, and consummation of the Trip (which may include certain disclaimers and limitations of liability).</p> Definitions <p>\"Booking.com,\" \"us,\" \"we,\" or \"our\" means Booking.com B.V., a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and having its registered address at Herengracht 597, 1017 CE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\"Platform\" means the (mobile) website and app on which the Trip Service is made available owned, controlled, managed, maintained, and/or hosted by Booking.com.\n\"Trip\" means the various different travel products and services that can be ordered, acquired, purchased, bought, paid, rented, provided, reserved, combined, or consummated by you from the Trip Provider.</p>\n<p>\"Trip Provider\" means the provider of accommodations (e.g.\nhotel, motel, apartment, bed &amp.\nbreakfast), attractions (e.g.\n(theme) parks, museums, sightseeing tours), transportation provider (e.g.\ncar rentals, cruises, rail, airport rides, bus tours, transfers), tour operators, travel insurances, and any other travel or related product or service as from time to time available for Trip Reservation on the Platform (whether B2B or B2C).</p>\n<p>\"Trip Service\" means the online purchase, order, (facilitated) payment, or reservation service as offered or enabled by Booking.com in respect to various products and services as from time to time made available by Trip Providers on the Platform.</p>\n<p>\"Trip Reservation\" means the order, purchase, payment, booking, or reservation of a Trip.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> 1.\nScope &amp.\nNature of Our Service <p>Through the Platform, we (Booking.com B.V.\nand its affiliate (distribution) partners) provide an online platform through which Trip Providers can advertise, market, sell, promote, and/or offer (as applicable) their products and service for order, purchase, reservation, rent, or hire, and through which relevant visitors of the Platform can discover, search, compare, and make an order, reservation, purchase, or payment (i.e.\nthe Trip Service).\nBy using or utilizing the Trip Service (e.g.\nby making a Trip Reservation through the Trip Service), you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Trip Provider in which you make a reservation or purchase a product or service (as applicable).\nFrom the point at which you make your Trip Reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Trip Provider.\nWe transmit the relevant details of your Trip Reservation to the relevant Trip Provider(s), and send you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the Trip Provider.\nBooking.com does not (re)sell, rent out, offer any (travel) product or service.</p>\n<p>For customers within the European Economic Area (\"<strong>EEA</strong>\"), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom the following applies.\nBased on self-declaration, we request Trip Providers globally to indicate to us if they\u2014in the context of EU consumer law\u2014act as a private host (non-trader) rather than as a professional host (trader).\nIf a Trip Provider indicates to us that it acts as a private host (or does not expressly indicate anything to us in this regard but based on information available to us cannot be clearly categorized as a professional host), such Trip Provider is labeled on the search result page as <i>\"managed by a private host\"</i> and the following explanation is added: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<i>\"This property is managed by a private host.\nEU consumer law relating to professional hosts might not apply.\nHosts who have registered with Booking.com as a private host are parties that rent out their property or properties for purposes that are outside their trade, business, or profession.\nThey aren't officially traders (like a global hotel chain) and therefore may not fall under the same consumer protection rules under EU law, but don\u2019t worry \u2013 Booking.com provides you with the same customer service as we do with any stay.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that your stay or experience will be any different than booking with a professional host.\"</i>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nTrip Providers that aren't labeled as private hosts on our Platform act\u2014to our best knowledge\u2014as a professional host under EU consumer law.\nThe qualification as \"private host\" is only relevant for the purpose of EU consumer law and has no relevance for tax purposes, including VAT or any other similar indirect taxes levied by reference to added value, or sales and/or consumption.</p>\n<p>When rendering our Trip Service, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by Trip Providers.\nAs such, the Trip Providers that market and promote their Trips on the Platform are given access to our systems and Extranet through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates/fees/prices, availability, policies, conditions, and other relevant information that gets displayed on our Platform.\nAlthough we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our Trip Service, we will not verify and cannot guarantee that all information is accurate, complete, or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade, or maintenance of our Platform or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading, or untrue information, nor non-delivery of information.\nEach Trip Provider remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness, and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates/fees/prices, policies, conditions, and availability) displayed on our Platform.\nOur Platform does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification, (star) rating, or type of accommodation of any Trip Provider (or its facilities, venue, vehicles, (main or supplemental) products or services) made available, unless explicitly indicated or set out otherwise.</p>\n<p>Our Trip Service is made available for personal and non-commercial use only.\nTherefore, you are not allowed to resell, deep link, use, copy, monitor (e.g.\nspider, scrape), display, download, or reproduce any content or information, software, reservations, tickets, products, or services available on our Platform for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.</p> 2.\nPrices, We Price Match, Genius program, and offers facilitated by a partner company <p>The prices as offered by the Trip Providers on our Platform are highly competitive.\nAll prices for your Trip are displayed including VAT/sales tax and all other taxes (subject to change of such taxes) and fees, unless stated differently on our Platform or the confirmation email/ticket.\nTicket prices are per person or group and subject to validity or expiration as indicated on the ticket, if applicable.\nApplicable fees and taxes (including tourist/city tax) may be charged by the Trip Provider in the event of a no-show or cancellation.</p>\n<p>Sometimes cheaper rates are available on our Platform for a specific stay, product, or service, however, these rates made available by Trip Providers may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example non-cancelable and non-refundable.\nCheck the relevant product, service, and reservation conditions and details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.</p>\n<p>We want you to pay the lowest price possible for your product and service of choice.\nShould you find your property of choice booked through the Platform, with the same Trip conditions, at a lower rate on the Internet after you have made a reservation through us, we will match the difference between our rate and the lower rate under the terms and conditions of the We Price Match.\nOur We Price Match promise does not apply to non-accommodations related products and services.\n</p>\n<p>The currency converter is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time.\nactual rates may vary.</p>\n<p>Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding.</p>\n<p>All special offers and promotions are marked as such.\nIf they are not labeled as such, you cannot derive any rights in the event of obvious errors or mistakes.</p>\nGenius program\n<p>The Genius rate is a discounted rate offered by participating properties for certain rooms / accommodation types.</p>\n<p>The Genius rate is for members of Booking.com's Genius program.\nThe Genius program is open to anyone that has an account on the Platform.\nThere are no membership fees, and all you need to do to become a member is to create an account on Booking.com.\nThe membership and the Genius rates are for that individual member and are non-transferable.\nMembership can also be linked to specific campaigns or incentives, as occasionally launched or communicated per Booking.com\u2019s sole discretion.</p>\n<p>The Genius program consists of multiple membership levels based on the number of reservations made through the Booking.com platform, each with different levels of discounts on select properties and/or select options (https://www.booking.com/genius.html).\nMembership levels may vary and may be subject to change at the sole discretion of Booking.com.</p>\n<p>Booking.com reserves the right to revoke and cancel the Genius membership of any individual in the event of abuse, such as violation of these terms &amp.\nconditions and / or use of invalid credit cards.\nBooking.com furthermore reserves the right to revoke and cancel the Genius membership of any individual who engages in inappropriate behavior, such as violence, threat, harassment, discrimination, obscenity, or fraud in relation to Booking.com (or its employees and agents) and / or the accommodation (or its employees and agents).</p>\n<p>The Genius rate cannot be combined or used with other discounts (unless approved by the accommodation or indicated otherwise).\nBooking.com may, at its discretion, (partially) alter, limit, or modify the Genius program structure or any other feature of the program (including but not limited to the (status of the) subject Genius level(s)), for any reason, without prior notice.</p>\n<p>The Genius membership is linked to your account on Booking.com and will not expire or otherwise terminate unless you terminate, close, delete, or otherwise revoke your account.\nWithout notice to you, Booking.com also reserves the right to \u201cunregister\" or otherwise disable an account that is inactive.\nAn inactive account is defined as an account that has not made a reservation for more than five (5) years.\nIn the event that your account is disabled, you will no longer be eligible for the Genius benefits.\nYou may reactivate your account by making a qualifying reservation using your Booking.com account.</p>\nPartner offer\n<p>Booking.com may display offers that are not directly sourced from Trip Providers, but are facilitated by a Booking.com partner company, such as another platform (Partner offer).\nPartner offers will be clearly displayed and distinguished from the regular offers directly sourced from Trip Providers and have the following special conditions, unless mentioned otherwise on our Platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Price policy: As displayed on our Platform.</li>\n<li>Pay in advance: You\u2019ll pay securely with Booking.com at the time of the booking.</li>\n<li>No modifications: Once your booking is complete, any changes to your personal or booking details won't be possible.\nRequests can be made directly with the property but are not guaranteed.</li>\n<li>Can't combine with other offers: Other promotions, incentives, and rewards are not eligible on the booking.</li>\n<li>No guest review: It\u2019s not possible to leave a guest review on our Platform.</li>\n</ul> 3.\nPrivacy and Cookies <p>Booking.com respects your privacy.\nPlease take a look at our Privacy and Cookies Policy for further information.\n</p> 4.\nFree of charge for consumers, only Trip Providers pay! <p>Unless indicated otherwise, our service is free of charge for consumers because, unlike many other parties, we will not charge you for our Trip Service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the rate.\nYou will pay the Trip Provider the relevant amount as indicated in the Trip Reservation (plus\u2014insofar not included in the price\u2014relevant applicable taxes, levies, and fees (if applicable)).</p>\n<p>Trip Providers pay a commission (being a small percentage of the product price (e.g.\nroom price)) to Booking.com after the end user has consummated the service or product of the Trip Provider (e.g.\nafter the guest has stayed at (and paid) the accommodations).\nTrip Providers can improve their ranking by increasing their commission (Visibility Booster).\nThe use of the Visibility Booster (by increasing the commission in return for a better position in the ranking) is at each Trip Provider's discretion and may be used from time to time and product to product offered.\nThe algorithm of the ranking will take an increase in commission into account when determining the Default Ranking.\nPreferred partners pay a higher commission in return for a better position in the ranking.</p>\n<p>Only Trip Providers which have a commercial relationship with Booking.com (through an agreement) will be made available on Platform (for their B2B and/or B2C promotion of their product).\nBooking.com is not an open platform (like Amazon or eBay) where end users can make their product available (no C2C platform).\nBooking.com does not allow non-professional parties to offer or sell their products on or through Booking.com.</p> 5.\nCredit Card or Bank Transfer <p>If applicable and available, certain Trip Providers offer the opportunity for Trip Reservations to be paid (wholly or partly and as required under the payment policy of the Trip Provider) to the Trip Provider during the Trip Reservation process, by means of secure online payment (all to the extent offered and supported by your bank).\nFor certain products and services, Booking.com facilitates (through third party payment processors) the payment of the relevant product or service (i.e.\nthe payment facilitation service) for and on behalf of the Trip Provider (Booking.com never acts nor operates as the merchant of record).\nPayment is safely processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a third party payment processor.\nAny payment facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the Trip Provider will in each case constitute a payment of (part of) the booking price by you of the relevant product or service in final settlement (bevrijdende betaling) of such (partial) due and payable price and you cannot reclaim such paid monies.</p>\n<p>For certain (non-refundable) rates or special offers, note that Trip Providers may require that payment be made upfront by wire transfer (if available) or by credit card, and therefore your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged (sometimes without any option for refund) upon making the Trip Reservation.\nCheck the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your Trip Reservation.\nYou will not hold Booking.com liable or responsible for any (authorized, (allegedly) unauthorized or wrong) charge by the Trip Provider and not (re)claim any amount for any valid or authorized charge by the Trip Provider (including for pre-paid rates, no-show, and chargeable cancellation) of your credit card.</p>\n<p>In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third parties, most banks and credit card companies bear the risk and cover all charges resulting from such fraud or misuse, which may sometimes be subject to a deductible (usually set at EUR 50 (or the equivalent in your local currency)).\nIn the event that your credit card company or bank charges the deductible from you due to unauthorized transactions resulting from a reservation made on our Platform, we will pay you this deductible, up to an aggregate amount of EUR 50 (or the equivalent in your local currency).\nIn order to indemnify you, please report fraud to your credit card provider (in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures) and contact us immediately.\nPlease provide us with evidence of the charged deductible (e.g.\npolicy of the credit card company).\nThis indemnification only applies to credit card reservations made using Booking.com's secure server and the unauthorized use of your credit card resulting through our default or negligence and through no fault of your own while using the secure server.</p> 6.\nPrepayment, Cancellation, No-shows, and The Fine Print <p>By making a Trip Reservation with a Trip Provider, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Trip Provider, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Trip Provider that may apply to your Trip (including the fine print of the Trip Provider made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Trip Provider), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Trip Provider.\nThe relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Trip Provider can be obtained with the relevant Trip Provider.\nThe general cancellation and no-show policy of each Trip Provider is made available on our Platform on the Trip Provider information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable).\nNote that certain rates, fees, or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund, or change.\nApplicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Trip Provider in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation.\nCheck the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.\nNote that a Trip Reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be canceled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant due or payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Trip Provider and the reservation.\nCancellation and prepayment policies may vary per segment, product, or service of each Trip.\nCarefully read The Fine Print (below the Trip types or at the bottom of each Trip Provider page on our Platform) and important information in your reservation confirmation for additional policies as may be applied by the Trip Provider (e.g.\nin respect of age requirement, security deposit, non-cancellation/additional supplements for group bookings, extra beds/no free breakfast, pets/cards accepted).\nLate payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards, or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account, and you will not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Trip Provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.</p>\n<p>If you want to review, adjust, or cancel your Trip Reservation, revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein.\nNote that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the Trip Provider's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy, or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount.\nWe recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to making your reservation, and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.</p>\n<p>If you have a late or delayed arrival on the check-in date or only arrive the next day, make sure to (timely/promptly) communicate this with the Trip Provider so they know when to expect you to avoid cancellation of your Trip (Reservation) or charge of the no-show fee.\nOur customer service department can help you if needed with informing the Trip Provider.\nBooking.com does not accept any liability or responsibility for the consequences of your delayed arrival or any cancellation or charged no-show fee by the Trip Provider.</p> 7.\n(Further) Correspondence and Communication <p>By completing a Trip Reservation, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you shortly prior to your arrival date, giving you information on your destination and providing you with certain information and offers (including third-party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this information) relevant to your Trip (Reservation) and destination, (ii) an email after arrival to rate the (experience with your) Trip Provider and the Trip Service, and (iii) an email which we may send to you promptly after your stay inviting you to complete our guest review form.\nSee our privacy and cookies policy for more information about how we may contact you.</p>\n<p>Booking.com disclaims any liability or responsibility for any communication by or with the Trip Provider on or through its platform.\nYou cannot derive any rights from any request to, or communication with the Trip Provider or (any form of) acknowledgement of receipt of any communication or request.\nBooking.com cannot guarantee that any request or communication will be (duly and timely) received/read by, complied with, executed, or accepted by the Trip Provider.</p>\n<p>In order to duly complete and secure your Trip Reservation, you need to use your correct email address.\nWe are not responsible or liable for (and have no obligation to verify) any wrong or misspelled email address, or inaccurate or wrong (mobile) phone number or credit card number.</p>\n<p>Any claim or complaint against Booking.com or in respect to the Trip Service must be promptly submitted, but in any event within 30 days after the scheduled day of consummation of the product or service (e.g.\ncheck out date).\nAny claim or complaint that is submitted after the 30 days period may be rejected, and the claimant will forfeit the right to any (damage or cost) compensation.</p>\n<p>Due to the continuous update and adjustments of rates and availability, we strongly suggest to make screenshots when making a reservation to support your position (if needed).</p>\n<p>\n</p> 8.\nRanking, Preferred Program, Stars and Guest Reviews <p>We aim to display search results that are relevant to you by providing a personalized default ranking of Trip Providers on our Platform.\nYou can scroll through this default ranking, use filters, and sort by alternative ranking orders and thus have the ability to influence the presentation of search results to receive a ranking order based on other criteria.\nWe use multiple algorithms to produce default ranking results, a process that's constantly evolving.</p>\n<p>Booking.com has identified the following parameters to be most closely correlated with you finding a suitable Trip Provider and thus prioritizes these parameters in the algorithms (main parameters): Your personal search history, the rate of \"click-through\" from the search page to the hotel page (\"CTR\"), the number of bookings related to the number of visits to the Trip Provider page on the Platform (\"Conversion\"), gross (including cancellations) and net (excluding cancellations) bookings of a Trip Provider.\nConversion and CTR may be affected by various (stand-alone) factors including review scores (both aggregate scores and components), availability, policies, (competitive) pricing, quality of content, and certain features of the Trip Provider.\nThe commission percentage paid by the Trip Provider or other benefits to us (e.g.\nthrough commercial arrangements with the Trip Provider or strategic partners) may also impact the default ranking, as well as the Trip Provider\u2019s record of on-time payment.\nThe Trip Provider can also influence its ranking by participating in certain program, which may be updated from time to time, such as the Genius program, deals, the Preferred Partner Program, and the visibility booster (the latter two involve the Trip Provider paying us a higher commission).</p>\n<p>Accommodations' star ratings on Booking.com are not determined by Booking.com.\nStar ratings are either determined by properties themselves, or else by an independent third-party provider of (objective) star ratings.\nDeals are shown on the basis of the number of stars (low-to-high/high-to-low) that providers give to Booking.com.\nDepending on (local) regulations, the star classifications are either assigned by an (independent) third party, e.g.\nan (official) hotel rating organization or based on the accommodation providers opinion of themselves, regardless of objective criteria.\nBooking.com does not review nor impose formal obligations on star ratings.\nOverall, the star classification is a representation of how the accommodation compares to the legal requirements (if applicable) or, if not regulated, the sector or (customary) industry standards in terms of price, facilities, and available services (these requirements and standards vary between countries and organizations).</p>\n<p>In order to make it easier for customers to find the right match to their travel preferences, Booking.com may assign a quality rating, which is determined by Booking.com and displayed as a yellow tile, to certain accommodations.\nIn order to determine the comparable set, the quality rating is based on many (400+) features that can be divided over 5 major categories: (i)&nbsp;facilities/amenities/services offered by the accommodation on Booking.com, (ii) property configuration such as unit size, number of rooms, and occupancy, (iii) number and quality of the photos uploaded by the accommodation, (iv) average guest review score as well as some subscores (e.g.\ncleanliness) because those are proven to be particularly helpful for customers in assessing the quality of certain accommodations, and (v) anonymized and aggregated historical booking data (e.g.\nto assess the star rating of\nbooked accommodations).\nWe use these multiple features to derive statistical patterns.\nBased on these inputs, a machine-learning-based analysis is conducted which results in a quality rating (between 1\u20135, displayed by using 1\u20135 yellow tiles next to the name of the property) being automatically calculated and awarded to the accommodation.</p>\n<p>Only customers who have stayed at the Accommodation will be invited by Booking.com to comment on their stay at the relevant accommodations and to provide a score for certain aspects of their stay or may receive a rating request during their stay.\nThe completed guest review (including submitted rating during your stay) may be (a) uploaded onto the relevant Trip Provider's information page on our Platform for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your opinion of the service (level) and quality of the Trip Provider, and (b) (wholly or partly) used and placed by Booking.com at its sole discretion (e.g.\nfor marketing, promotion, or improvement of our services) on our Platform or such social media platforms, newsletters, special promotions, apps, or other channels owned, hosted, used, or controlled by Booking.com and our business partners.\nIn order to offer and maintain recent (and therefore relevant) reviews, reviews can only be submitted within a limited period of time (3 months) after a stay, and each review will only be available for a limited period of time (up to 36 months) after posting.\nThe default ranking of the reviews is by date of submission relative to a few additional criteria (such as language, reviews with comments), whereas a review of a customer who [always] submits comprehensive and detailed reviews (aka \"Property Scout\") may be ranked on top.\nYou have the option to choose various forms of rankings and filters (e.g.\nby audience, date, language, score).\nBooking.com does allow the Trip Provider to respond to a review.\nWe reserve the right to adjust, refuse, or remove reviews at our sole discretion insofar as it violates our review policy.\nBooking.com does not compensate or otherwise reward customers for completing a review.\nThe guest review form should be regarded as a survey and does not include any (further commercial) offers, invitations, or incentives whatsoever.\nBooking.com undertakes its best efforts to monitor and remove reviews that include obscenities, mentions of an individual\u2019s name, or references to stolen goods.</p>\n<p>Booking.com will not accept reviews which include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profanity, sexually explicit, hate speech, discriminatory, threats, violence</li>\n<li>Mention of full names, personal attack towards the staff</li>\n<li>Promoting illegal activities (e.g.\ndrugs, prostitution)</li>\n<li>Sites, emails, and addresses, phone numbers, cc details</li>\n<li>Politically sensitive comments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Booking.com and the Trip Provider are each entitled to terminate their relationship for whatever reason (including in the event of breach of contract or (filing for) bankruptcy) with due observance of the relevant notice period as agreed between both parties.</p> 9.\nDisclaimer <p>Subject to the limitations set out in these terms and conditions and to the extent permitted by law, we will only be liable for direct damages actually suffered, paid, or incurred by you due to an attributable shortcoming of our obligations in respect to our services, up to an aggregate amount of the aggregate cost of your reservation as set out in the Trip Reservation confirmation email (whether for one event or series of connected events).</p>\n<p>However and to the extent permitted by law, neither we nor any of our officers, directors, employees, representatives, subsidiaries, affiliated companies, distributors, affiliate (distribution) partners, licensees, agents, or others involved in creating, sponsoring, promoting, or otherwise making available the site and its contents will be liable for (i) any punitive, special, indirect, or consequential loss or damages, any loss of production, loss of profit, loss of revenue, loss of contract, loss of or damage to goodwill or reputation, loss of claim, (ii) any inaccuracy relating to the (descriptive) information (including rates, availability, and ratings) of the Trip Provider as made available on our Platform, (iii) the services rendered or the

a private limited liability company, incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands and having its offices at Herengracht 597, 1017 CE Amsterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the trade register of the Chamber of Commerce in Amsterdam under registration number 31047344.\nOur VAT registration number is NL805734958B01.</p>\n<p>Booking.com has its headquarters in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and is supported by various affiliated group companies (the \"support companies\") throughout the world.\nThe support companies only provide an internal supporting role to and for the benefit of Booking.com.\nCertain designated support companies render limited customer care support services (only by telephone).\nThe support companies do not have any Platform (and do not in any way control, manage, maintain, or host the Platform).\nThe support companies do not have any power or authority to render the Trip Service, to represent Booking.com, or to enter into any contract in the name of, for or on behalf of Booking.com.\nYou do not have a (legal or contractual) relationship with the support companies.\nThe support companies do not operate and are not authorized to act as any form of process or service agent of Booking.com.\nBooking.com does not accept nor assume any domicile at any place, location, or office in the world (also not at the office of its support companies), other than its registered office in Amsterdam.</p> 13.\nGoverning Law and Disputes <p>Booking.com is committed to customer satisfaction.\nWe will try to resolve any concerns or problems with our services that you have.\nIf we are unsuccessful, you may pursue a claim against Booking.com as explained in this Disputes provision.\nThis Disputes provision lays out: (1) the initial process you must follow by reporting your claim to Booking.com prior to filing any arbitration or law suit in accordance with this Disputes provision.\nand, if we are unable to resolve your claim, (2) the recourse that you have to arbitration.</p>\n<p>To the extent permitted by law, these terms and conditions and the provision of our services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Dutch law.\nBy using this website, you agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating to your use of this website, or other services provided by Booking.com or the support companies in connection with your use of this website (including the interpretation and scope of this clause and the arbitrability of the dispute), will be resolved via mandatory, binding arbitration.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this Disputes provision shall be read to create any legal rights that do not otherwise exist under the law or constitute any waiver of any personal jurisdiction defense, nor shall this Disputes provision give you the right to pursue any claim for relief that is not cognizable under the law.</p>\n<p>Prior to initiating arbitration, as discussed further below, you must give us an opportunity to resolve any complaints you have relating to your use of the Booking.com website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, or our Privacy Policy by submitting them to customer.service@booking.com (the \u201cInternal Review Procedure\u201d).\nYour email to customer.service@booking.com beginning the Internal Review Procedure must contain the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) the email address you used to make your reservation, (4) your reservation number, (5) the date of your reservation, (6) the name of the property that you reserved, (7) a brief description of the nature of your complaint, and (8) the resolution that you are seeking (together, the \u201cRequired Information\u201d).\nAdditionally, the subject line of your email must state, \u201cRequest Under Disputes Provision.\u201d If your email does not have this subject line, or if it does not contain all of the Required Information (or an explanation of why you are unable to include any of the Required Information), then you have not effectively begun the Internal Review Procedure, which you must do before initiating any arbitration or other legal action against Booking.com.\nIf we are not able to resolve your complaint within 60 days of your starting the Internal Review Procedure, you may seek relief as laid out in this Disputes provision.</p>\n<p>Arbitration shall be initiated through and administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d).\nShould the AAA decline to administer the arbitration or otherwise be unable to administer the arbitration for any reason, you agree that Booking.com will select an alternative arbitral forum, and that you will agree in writing to administration of the arbitration by the alternative arbitral forum selected by Booking.com.</p>\n<p>In order to initiate arbitration, you and Booking.com each will be responsible for paying the filing fees required by the AAA.\nIn the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, Booking.com will pay as much of your filing fee in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation.</p>\n<p>Arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA\u2019s rules.\nIf there is a conflict between the AAA\u2019s rules and this Disputes provision, the terms of this Disputes provision will govern.\nThe rules are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nIf the AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration for any reason, then arbitration will proceed in a substantially similar fashion as it would under the AAA\u2019s rules.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be conducted by one arbitrator, who will be appointed by the AAA.\nYou agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language.\nFor claims under $25,000, the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses but will instead be conducted based solely on written submissions, unless you request an in-person or telephonic hearing or the arbitrator determines that an in-person or telephonic appearance is required.\nIn the case of a hearing, the presumption shall be in favor of a telephonic hearing, unless the arbitrator determines that a party\u2019s right to a fundamentally fair process would be impaired without an in-person hearing.\nIn the case of an in-person hearing, the hearing shall be conducted in a mutually convenient location.\nBooking.com will ordinarily request that the hearing be held in Chicago, Illinois.\nYou may petition the arbitrator to select an alternative location for the hearing.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s selection of a hearing location shall be final and binding.\nYou agree that in the event of an in-person hearing, any Booking.com B.V.\nemployee or affiliate who is based outside of the United States and who is participating in the hearing may participate by telephone or video conference, and his or her physical presence will not be required.</p>\n<p>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is made under and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any choice-of-law principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor Booking.com may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of non-privileged documents directly relevant to the dispute.\nUnless the arbitrator determines that an additional form of information exchange is necessary to provide for a fundamentally fair process, those documents will be limited to your booking and communications directly about that booking among you, Booking.com, and the accommodation(s) that are the subject of your dispute with Booking.com.\nAny issues regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, will be determined by the arbitrator, and the arbitrator\u2019s determination will be conclusive.</p>\n<p>The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThere will be no right or authority for any Claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis.\nYou understand and agree that, by accepting these terms and conditions, you and Booking.com are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action with respect to the claims covered by this mandatory arbitration provision.</p>\n<p>You are thus giving up your right to go to court to assert or defend your rights.\nYour rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, and not a judge or jury.\nThe arbitration procedures mandated by this Disputes provision are simpler and more limited than the procedures applicable in most courts.\nArbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by a court.</p>\n<p>All claims you bring against Booking.com must be resolved in accordance with this Disputes provision.\nAll claims filed or brought contrary to this Disputes provision, including claims not first submitted through the Internal Review Procedure, will be considered improperly filed and void.\nShould you file a claim contrary to this Disputes provision, Booking.com will notify you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you must promptly withdraw the claim.</p>\n<p>This Disputes provision was amended by Booking.com effective April 7, 2016.\nIf you have a claim that relates to a booking made prior to that date, you may choose to proceed under the provision in effect when you made your booking.\nIf you would like to do that, please so indicate in your claim submission.\nOtherwise, by submitting a claim, you agree that this Disputes provision will apply to your claim.</p>\n", "created_at":

Reservations: First and foremost, we use your personal data to complete and administer your online Trip Reservation, which is essential for what we do.\nThis includes sending you communications that relate to your Trip Reservation, such as confirmations, modifications, and reminders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer service: We provide international customer service from our local offices in more than 20 languages and are here to help 24/7.\nSharing relevant details such as reservation info or info about your user account with our global customer service staff allows us to respond when you need us.\nThis includes helping you to contact the right Trip Provider and responding to any questions you might have about your Trip Reservation (or any other questions, for that matter).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Account facilities: Booking.com users can create an account on our website or apps.\nWe use the info you give us to administer this account, enabling you to do a number of useful things.\nYou can manage your Trip Reservations, take advantage of special offers, make future Trip Reservations easily, and manage your personal settings.</p>\n<p>Managing personal settings lets you keep and share lists, share photos, view previously searched Trip Services, and check other travel-related info you've provided.\nYou can also see any reviews you\u2019ve written.</p>\n<p>If you want, you can share certain info as part of your user account by creating a public profile under your own first name or a screen name you choose.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a Booking.com for Business account holder, you can also save contact details under that account, manage business reservations, and link other account holders to the same Booking.com for Business account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Online groups: We might give account holders the chance to connect and interact with each other through online groups or forums.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing activities: We use your information for marketing activities.\nThese activities include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Using your contact info to send you regular news about travel-related products and services.\nYou can unsubscribe from email marketing communications quickly, easily, and anytime.\nAll you need to do is click the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link included in each newsletter or other communication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Based on your info, individualized offers might be shown to you on the Booking.com website, on mobile apps, or on third-party websites/apps (including social media sites), and the content of the site displayed to you might be personalized.\nThese could be offers that you can book directly on the Booking.com website, on co-branded sites, or other third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you participate in other promotional activities (e.g.\nsweepstakes, referral programs, or competitions), relevant info will be used to administer these promotions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communicating with you: There might be other times when we get in touch, including by email, mail, phone, or text.\nWhich method we choose depends on the contact info you previously shared.</p>\n<p>We process the communications you send to us.\nThere could be a number of reasons for this, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Responding to and handling any requests you or your booked Trip Provider have made.\nBooking.com also offers customers and Trip Providers various ways to exchange info, requests, and comments about Trip Providers and existing Trip Reservations via Booking.com.\nFor more info, read the section titled \u201cHow does Booking.com process communications that you and your booked Trip Provider may send through Booking.com?.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you haven't finalized a Trip Reservation online, we can contact you with a reminder to continue with your reservation.\nWe believe this additional service benefits you because it allows you to carry on with a Trip Reservation without having to search for Trip Providers or enter your reservation details again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you use our services, we might send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with Booking.com or the Trip Provider.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also send you other material related to your Trip Reservations, such as how to contact Booking.com if you need assistance while you\u2019re away, and information that we feel might be useful to you in planning or making the most of your Trip.\nWe might also send you material related to upcoming Trip Reservations or a summary of previous Trip Reservations you made through Booking.com.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have an upcoming Trip Reservation, we may still need to send you other administrative messages, which could include security alerts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Market research: We sometimes invite our customers to take part in market research.\nReview the info that accompanies this kind of invitation to understand what personal data will be collected and how it\u2019s used.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improving our services: We also use personal data for analytical purposes and product improvement.\nThis is part of our commitment to improving our services and enhancing the user experience.</p>\n<p>In this case, we use data for testing and troubleshooting purposes, as well as generating statistics about our business.\nThe main goal here is to get insights into how our services perform, how they\u2019re used, and ultimately to optimize and customize our website and apps, making them easier and more meaningful to use.\nWe strive to use pseudonyms for this analytical work as much as possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Providing the best price applicable to you, depending on where you\u2019re based: When you search our apps or website (e.g.\nto find an accommodation, rental car, or flight), we process your IP address to confirm whether you\u2019re in the European Economic Area (EEA) or another country.\nWe do this to offer you the best price for the region (EEA) or country (non-EEA) where you\u2019re based.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customer reviews and other destination-related info: During and after your Trip, we might invite you to submit a review.\nWe can also make it possible for the people you\u2019re traveling with or whom you booked a reservation for to do this instead.\nThis invite asks for info about the Trip Provider or the destination.</p>\n<p>If you have a Booking.com account, you can choose to display a screen name next to your review instead of your real name ,or even submit the review anonymously.\nIf you\u2019d like to set a screen name, you can do so in your account settings.\nAdding an avatar is also possible.</p>\n<p>By completing a review, you\u2019re agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms and Conditions) on, for example, the relevant Trip Provider info page on our websites, on our mobile apps, on our social media accounts and social media apps, or on the online platform of the relevant Trip Provider or business partner\u2019s website.\nThis is to inform other travelers about the quality of the Trip Service you used, the destination you have chosen, or any other experiences you choose to share.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Call monitoring: When you make calls to our customer service team, Booking.com uses an automated telephone number detection system to match your telephone number to your existing reservations.\nThis helps save time for both you and our customer service staff.\nHowever, our customer service staff may still ask for authentication, which helps to keep your reservation details confidential.</p>\n<p>During calls with our customer service team, live listening might be carried out or calls might be recorded for quality control and training purposes.\nThis includes the use of the recordings for handling of complaints, legal claims, and fraud detection.</p>\n<p>Not all calls are recorded.\nRecordings are kept for a limited amount of time before being automatically deleted.\nAn exception to this rule is when Booking.com has a legitimate need to keep the recordings longer for fraud investigation or legal purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service: To create a trustworthy environment for you, the people you bring with you on your Trip, Booking.com\u2019s business partners, and our Trip Providers, we might use personal data to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we might use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including the authentication of users and reservations.\nWhen we do this we may have to stop or put certain Trip Reservations on hold until we finish our assessment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal purposes: Finally, in certain cases, we may need to use your info to handle and resolve legal disputes, for regulatory investigations and compliance to enforce the Booking.com online reservation service terms of use, or to comply with legal requests from law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Providing your personal data to Booking.com is voluntary.\nHowever, we may only be able to provide you with certain services if we can only collect some personal data.\nFor example, we can\u2019t process your Trip Reservation if we don\u2019t collect your name and contact details.</p>\n<p>If we use automation to process personal data that produces legal effects or significantly affects you, we\u2019ll always implement the measures required to safeguard your rights and freedoms.\nThis includes the right to obtain human intervention.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\nTo process your personal data as described above, we rely on the following legal bases:\n<p>As applicable, for purpose A and B, Booking.com relies on the legal basis that the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract, specifically to finalize and administer your Trip Reservation.</p>\n<p>If the required personal data isn\u2019t provided, Booking.com can\u2019t finalize the Trip Reservation, nor can we provide customer service.\nIn view of purposes C to L, Booking.com relies on its legitimate commercial business interest to provide its services, prevent fraud, and improve our services (as set out more specifically under C to L).</p>\n<p>When using personal data to serve Booking.com\u2019s or a third party's legitimate interest, Booking.com will always balance your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data against Booking.com\u2019s rights and interests or those of the third party.\nFor purpose M, Booking.com also relies, where applicable, on compliance with legal obligations (such as legal law enforcement requests).</p>\n<p>Finally, when required under law, Booking.com will obtain your consent prior to processing your personal data, including for email marketing purposes or as otherwise required by law.</p>\n<p>If you wish to object to the processing set out under C to L and no opt-out mechanism is available to you directly (for example, in your account settings), contact us at dataprotectionoffice@booking.com.</p> How does Booking.com share your data with third parties?\n<p>In certain circumstances, we\u2019ll share your personal data with third parties.\nThese third parties include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Trip Provider You Booked: In order to complete your Trip Reservation, we transfer relevant reservation details to the Trip Provider you've booked.\nThis is one of the most essential things we do for you.</p>\n<p>Depending on the Trip Reservation and Trip Provider, the details we share can include your name, contact and payment details, the names of the people accompanying you, and any other info or preferences you specified when you made your Trip Reservation.</p>\n<p>In certain cases, we also provide some additional historical info about you to the Trip Provider.\nThis includes whether you\u2019ve already booked with them in the past, the number of completed bookings you\u2019ve made with Booking.com, a confirmation that no misconduct has been reported about you, the percentage of bookings you\u2019ve canceled in the past, or whether you\u2019ve given reviews about past bookings.</p>\n<p>If you have a question about your Trip, we may contact the Trip Provider to handle your request.\nUnless payment is made during the booking process through the Booking.com website, we\u2019ll forward your credit card details to the booked Trip Provider for handling (assuming you provide us those details).</p>\n<p>In cases of Trip Reservation-related disputes, we may provide the Trip Provider with your contact details, including your email address and info about the Trip Reservation process needed to handle the dispute.\nThis may include a copy of your reservation confirmation as proof that a Trip Reservation was actually made.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, at the direction of the Trip Provider, we\u2019ll need to share your personal data with parties related to the Trip Provider to finalize and administer your reservation.\nThese parties might include other entities of a hotel group or service providers who are handling the data on the Trip Provider\u2019s behalf.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your local Booking.com

screening)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Payment</p>\n<p>We use third parties to process payments, handle chargebacks or provide billing collection services.\nWhen a chargeback is requested for your Trip Reservation, either by you or the holder of the credit card used to make the reservation, we\u2019ll need to share certain reservation details with the payment service provider and the relevant financial institution so they can handle the chargeback.\nThis could also include a copy of your reservation confirmation or the IP address used to make your reservation.\nWe might share information with relevant financial institutions if we consider it strictly necessary for fraud detection and prevention purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing services</p>\n<p>We share personal data with advertising partners, including your email address, as part of marketing Booking.com services via third parties to ensure that relevant ads are shown to the right audience.\nWe use techniques like hashing to enable the matching of your email address with an existing customer database so that your email address can\u2019t be used for other purposes.\nFor info about other personalized ads and your choices, read our Cookie Statement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advertising partners</p>\n<p>We use advertising partners like metasearch providers to allow you to compare our offers with the offers of other Online Travel Agencies (OTAs).\nWhen you make a reservation on Booking.com after using an advertising partner, we\u2019ll send the details of the reservation that you made on Booking.com to that partner.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All service providers are required to continue to safeguard your personal data adequately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Competent Authorities: We disclose personal data to law enforcement to the extent required by law or strictly necessary for the prevention, detection, or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud, or if we\u2019re legally obliged to do so otherwise.\nWe may need to further disclose personal data to competent authorities to protect and defend our rights or properties, or the rights and properties of our business partners.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business partners: We work with many business partners around the world.\nThese business partners distribute or advertise the Booking.com services, including the services and products of our Trip Providers.</p>\n<p>When you make a reservation on one of our business partners\u2019 websites or apps, certain personal data that you give them, such as your name and email address, address, payment details, and other relevant info will be forwarded to us to finalize and manage your Trip Reservation.</p>\n<p>If customer service is provided by the business partner, Booking.com will share relevant reservation details with them (as and when needed) to provide you with appropriate and efficient support.</p>\n<p>When you make a reservation through one of our business partners\u2019 websites, the business partners can receive certain parts of your personal data related to the specific reservation and your interactions on these partner websites.\nThis is for their commercial purposes.</p>\n<p>When you make a reservation on a business partner\u2019s website, take the time to read their privacy notice if you\u2019d like to understand how they process your personal data.</p>\n<p>For fraud detection and prevention purposes, we may also exchange info about our users with business partners, but only when strictly necessary</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Partner Offer: We may enable you to book using Partner Offer, which means your reservation is facilitated by a Trip Provider separate from the booked accommodation.\nAs part of the reservation process, we\u2019ll need to share some relevant personal data with this Trip Provider.</p>\n<p>If Partner Offer is used, review the info provided in the booking process or check your reservation confirmation for more info about the Trip Provider and how your personal data is further processed by them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Booking Holdings Inc.\ncorporate group: Read about how we share your personal data

countries whose data protection laws aren\u2019t as comprehensive as those of the countries within the European Union.</p>\n<p>Where required by European law, we\u2019ll only transfer personal data to recipients that offer an adequate level of data protection.\nIn these situations, as may be required, we make contractual arrangements to ensure that your personal data is still protected in line with

(e.g.\nFacebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button), certain info is shared with these social media providers.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re logged-in to your social media account at the same time, your social

service provider may allow you to share info with us.</p>\n<p>If you choose to share, you will generally be told by your social media provider which information will be shared.\nFor example, when you sign in to a Booking.com user account using your social media account, certain info may be shared with Booking.com, including your email address, age, or profile pictures saved to your social media account, depending on what you authorize.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When you register with a Booking.com social media app or connect to a social media messaging service without a Booking.com user account, the info you choose to share with us may include the basic info available in your social media profile, including your email, status updates, and a list of your contacts.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll use this info to help provide you with the service you requested, for example, to forward a message you want to send to your contacts or to create a personalized user experience on the app or our websites.\nIt means that\u2014if you want us to\u2014we can customize our services to fit your needs, connecting you and your friends to the best travel destinations, as well as analyzing and enhancing our

procedures does Booking.com put in place to safeguard your personal data?\n<p>We observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to and the misuse of personal data.</p>\n<p>We use

to otherwise allow us to conduct our business, including to detect and prevent fraud or other illegal activities.\nAll personal data we keep about you is covered by this Privacy Statement.</p>\n<p>For added protection, we strongly recommend setting up two-factor authentication for your Booking.com account.\nThis adds an extra authentication step to make sure anyone who gets ahold of your username and password (e.g.\nthrough phishing or social engineering) won\u2019t be able to access your account.\nYou can set this up in the Security section of your account settings.</p> How does Booking.com treat personal data belonging to children?\n<p>Our services aren\u2019t intended for children under 16, and we\u2019ll never collect their data unless it\u2019s provided by (and with the consent of) a parent or guardian.\nThe limited cases we might need to collect data for include as part of a reservation, the purchase of other travel-related services, or in other exceptional circumstances, such as features addressed to families.\nAgain, this will only be used and collected as provided by a parent or guardian and with their consent.</p>\n<p>If we find out that we processed info of a child under 16 without the valid consent of a parent or guardian, we reserve the right to delete it.</p> How can you control the personal data you\u2019ve given to Booking.com?\n<p>We want you to be in control of

us of any changes to your personal data or ask us to correct any of the personal data we hold about you.\nAs explained below, you can make some of these changes yourself when you have a user account.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In certain situations, you can ask us to erase, block, or restrict the processing of the personal data we hold about you, or object to particular ways that we use your personal data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In certain situations, you can also ask us to send the personal data you've given us to a third party.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where we use your personal data on the basis of your consent, you\u2019re entitled to withdraw that consent at any time, subject to applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where we process your personal data based on legitimate interest or the public interest, you have the right to object to that use of your personal data at any time, subject to applicable law.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We rely on you to make sure that your personal info is

to as \u201ccookies\u201d for the purpose of this Cookie Statement).</p>\n<p>Cookies can be used in various ways, including to make the Booking.com website work, analyze traffic, or for advertising purposes.</p>\n<p>Read below to learn more about what a \u201ccookie\u201d is, how they\u2019re used, and what your choices are.</p>\n<p>\nWhat are cookies and other online tracking technologies?\n</p>\n<p>\nHow are cookies used?\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat are your choices?\n</p> What are cookies and online tracking technologies?\n<p>A web browser cookie is a small text file that websites place on your computer\u2019s or mobile device\u2019s web browser.</p>\n<p>These cookies store info about the content you view and interact with to remember your preferences and settings or analyze how you use online services.</p>\n<p>Cookies are divided into \u201cfirst party\u201d and \u201cthird party\u201d:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>First party cookies</strong> are the cookies served by the owner of the domain.\nIn our case, that\u2019s Booking.com.\nAny cookie we place ourselves is a \u201cfirst-party cookie.\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Third-party cookies</strong> are cookies placed on our domains by trusted partners that we\u2019ve allowed to do so.\nThese can be social media partners, advertising partners, security providers, and more.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And they can be either \u201csession cookies\u201d or \u201cpermanent cookies\u201d:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Session cookies</strong> only exist until you close your browser, ending what\u2019s called your \u201csession.\u201d Then they\u2019re deleted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Permanent cookies</strong> have a range of lifespans and stay on your device after the browser is closed.\nOn the Booking.com platform, we try to only serve permanent cookies (or allow permanent cookies to be served by third parties) that have a limited lifespan.\nHowever, for security reasons or in other exceptional circumstances, sometimes we may need to give a cookie a longer lifespan.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Web browser cookies may store info such as your IP address or other identifiers, your browser type, and info about the content you view and interact with on digital services.\nBy storing this info, web browser cookies can remember your preferences and settings for online services and analyze how you use them.</p>\n<p>Along with cookies, we also use tracking technologies that are very similar.\nOur website, emails, and mobile apps may contain small transparent image files or lines of code that record how you interact with them.\nThese include \u201cweb beacons,\u201d \u201cscripts,\u201d \u201ctracking URLs,\u201d or \u201csoftware development kits\u201d (known as SDKs):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Web beacons</strong> have a lot of different names.\nThey might also be known as web bugs, tracking bugs, tags, web tags, page tags, tracking pixels, pixel tags, 1x1 GIFs, or clear GIFs.</p>\n<p>In short, these beacons are a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be delivered to your device as part of a web page request, in an app, an advertisement, or an HTML email message.</p>\n<p>They can be used to retrieve info from your device, such as your device type, operating system, IP address, and the time of your visit.\nThey are also used to serve and read cookies in your browser or to trigger the placement of a cookie.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Scripts</strong> are small computer programs embedded within our web pages that give those pages a wide variety of extra functionality.\nScripts make it possible for the website to function properly.\nFor example, scripts power certain security features and enable basic interactive features on our website.</p>\n<p>Scripts can also be used for analytical or advertising purposes.\nFor example, a script can collect info about how you use our website, such as which pages you visit or what you search for.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Tracking URLs</strong> are links with a unique identifier in them.\nThese are used to track which website brought you to the Booking.com website or app you\u2019re using.\nAn example would be if you clicked from a social media page, search engine, or one of our affiliate partners\u2019 websites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Software Development Kits (SDKs)</strong> are part of our apps\u2019 source code.\nUnlike browser cookies, SDK data is stored in the app storage.</p>\n<p>They\u2019re used to analyze how the apps are being used or to send personalized push notifications.\nTo do this, they record unique identifiers associated with your device, like your device ID, IP address, in-app activity, and network location.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these tracking technologies are referred to as \u201ccookies\u201d here in this Cookie Statement.</p> How are cookies used?\n<p>Cookies are used to collect info, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>IP address</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Device ID</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Viewed pages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Browser type</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Browsing info</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Operating system</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Internet service provider</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Timestamp</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Whether you have responded to an advertisement</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A referral URL</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Features used or activities engaged in on the website/apps</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>They allow you to be recognized as the same user across the pages of a website, devices, between websites, or when you use our apps.\nWhen it comes to purpose, they\u2019re divided into three categories: Functional cookies, analytical cookies, and marketing cookies.</p>\nFunctional cookies\n<p>These are cookies required for our websites and apps to function and must be enabled for you to use our services.</p>\n<p>Functional cookies are used to create technologically advanced, user-friendly websites and apps that adapt automatically to your needs and preferences, so you can browse and book easily.\nThis also includes enabling essential security and accessibility features.</p>\n<p>More specifically, these cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Enable our website and apps to work properly, so you can create an account, sign in, and manage your bookings.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember your selected currency and language settings, past searches, and other preferences to help you use our website and apps efficiently and effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Remember your registration info so you don\u2019t have to retype your log-in credentials each time you visit our website or app.\n(Don\u2019t worry, passwords are always encrypted.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\nAnalytical cookies\n<p>These cookies measure and track how our website and apps are used.\nWe use this info to improve our website, apps, and services.</p>\n<p>More specifically, these cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Help us understand how visitors and customers like you use Booking.com and our apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help improve our website, apps, and communications to make sure we're interesting and relevant.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Allow us to find out what does and doesn't work on our website and apps.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Help us understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Teach us how users interact with our website or apps after they\u2019re shown an online ad, including ads on third-party websites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enable our business partners to learn whether or not their customers make use of any accommodation offers integrated into their websites.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The data we gather through these cookies can include which web pages you\u2019ve viewed, which referral/exit pages you\u2019ve entered and left from, which platform type you\u2019ve used, which emails you\u2019ve opened and acted upon, and date and timestamp info.\nIt also means we can use details about how you\u2019ve interacted with the site or app, such as the number of clicks you make on a given screen, your mouse and scrolling activity, the search words you use, and the text you enter into various fields.</p>\nMarketing cookies\n<p>These cookies are used by Booking.com and our trusted partners to gather info about you over time, across multiple websites, applications, or other platforms.</p>\n<p>Marketing cookies help us to decide which products, services, and interest-based ads to show you, both on and off our website and apps.</p>\n<p>More specifically, these cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Categorize you into a certain interest profile, for example, based on the websites you visit and your click behavior.\nWe use these profiles to display personalized content (e.g.\ntravel ideas or specific accommodations) on Booking.com and other websites.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Display personalized and interest-based ads both on the Booking.com website, our apps, and other websites.\nThis is called \u201cretargeting\u201d and is based on your browsing activities, such as the destinations you\u2019ve searched for, the accommodations you\u2019ve viewed, and the prices you\u2019ve been shown.\nIt can also be based on your shopping habits or other online activities.</p>\n<p>Retargeting ads can be shown to you both before and after you leave Booking.com since their aim is to encourage you to browse or return to our website.\nYou might see these ads on websites, apps, or in emails.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrate social media into our website and apps.\nThis allows you to like or share content or products on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Snapchat, and LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>These \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons work using pieces of code from the individual social media providers, allowing third-party cookies to be placed on your device.</p>\n<p>These cookies can be purely functional, but can also be used to keep track of which websites you visit from their network, to build a profile of your online browsing behavior, and to show you personalized ads.\nThis profile will be partly built using comparable info the providers receive from your visits to other websites in their network.</p>\n<p>\nTo read more about what social media providers do with your personal data, take a look at their cookie and/or privacy statements: Facebook (includes Instagram, Messenger, and Audience Network), Snapchat, Pinterest, and Twitter.\nBe aware that these statements may be updated from time to time.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nWe work with trusted third parties to collect data.\nWe may occasionally share info with these third parties, such as your email address or phone number.\nThese third parties might link your data to other info they collect to create custom audiences or deliver targeted ads.\nFor info about how these third parties process your data, take a look at the following links: How Google uses information, Facebook's data policy.\n</p>\nNon-cookie techniques \u2013 email pixels\n<p>We may also use techniques like pixels, which we don\u2019t mark as cookies because they don\u2019t store any info on your device.</p>\n<p>We sometimes place pixels in emails like newsletters.\nA \u201cpixel\u201d is an electronic file the size of a single pixel that\u2019s placed in the email and loaded when you open it.\nBy using email pixels, we can see if the message was delivered, if and when you read it, and what you click.</p>\n<p>We also receive this info about the push notifications we send you.\nThese statistics provide us with feedback about your reading behavior, which we use to optimize our messages, and make our communications more relevant to you.</p> What are your choices?\n<p>To learn more about cookies and how to manage or delete them, visit allaboutcookies.org or the help section of your browser.</p>\n<p>Under the settings for browsers like Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or Chrome, you can choose which cookies to accept and

you to limit the sharing of info for retargeting purposes through its settings.\nIf you choose to do so, remember that opting out of an online advertising network doesn't mean you\u2019ll no longer see or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis.\nIt just means the network you opted out of won't deliver ads customized to your web preferences and browsing patterns anymore.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some websites have \u201cDo Not Track\u201d features that allow you to tell a website not to track you.\nWe\u2019re currently unable to support \u201cDo Not Track\u201d
