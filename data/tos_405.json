(excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</li>\n<li>(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.\nBefore either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (\u201c<b>Notice</b>\u201d) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.\nA Notice to the Company should be sent to: 285 Hamilton Avenue, Suite 250, Palo Alto CA 94301, USA.\nAfter the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.\nIf you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.\nThe amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</li>\n<li>(c) Arbitration Rules.\nArbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (\u201c<b>AAA</b>\u201d), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (\u201c<b>ADR Provider</b>\u201d) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.\nIf AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.\nThe rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.\nThe AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.\nThe arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.\nAny claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00 ) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.\nFor claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.\nDollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.\nAny hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nEach party shall bear its own costs (including attorney\u2019s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.\n</li>\n<li>(d) Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration: If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions.\nthe specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.\nThe arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.</li>\n<li>(e) Time Limits.\nIf you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</li>\n<li>(f) Authority of Arbitrator.\nIf arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.\nThe arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.\nThe arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.\n</li>\n<li>(g) Waiver of Jury Trial.\nTHE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.\nArbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.\nIn the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</li>\n<li>(h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.\nALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</li>\n<li>(i) Confidentiality.\nAll aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential.\nThe parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.\nThis Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li>\n<li>(j) Severability.\nIf any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in </li>\n<li>(k) Right to Waive.\nAny or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.\nSuch waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.</li>\n<li>(l) Survival of Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</li>\n<li>(m) Small Claims Court.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li>\n<li>(n) Emergency Equitable Relief.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.\nA request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</li>\n<li>(o) Claims Not Subject To Arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.\n</li>\n<li>(p) Courts.\nIn any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Diego County, California, for such purpose.\n</li>\n</ul>13.8 Governing Law<p>The Terms and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of California, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, without giving effect to any principles that provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction.\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.</p>13.9 Notice<p>Where the Company requires that you provide an e-mail address, you are

class postage prepaid mail at the above address.</p>13.10 Waiver<p>Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of the Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.</p>13.11 Severability<p>If any provision of the Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of the Terms will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>13.12 Export Control<p> You may not use,
