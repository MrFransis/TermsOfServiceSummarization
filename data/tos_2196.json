We\u2019re Life on Air, Inc., a subsidiary of Epic Games.\nTo learn more about privacy at Houseparty, please keep reading below! If you\u2019d like to read more about privacy at Epic Games, be sure to check out the Epic Games Privacy Policy here.</p> What Information We Collect <p>You probably wonder what information we collect.\nThis often depends on the exact nature of our relationship with you and how you choose to use Houseparty, but we\u2019ve described the most common examples below.\nWe have broken these descriptions down into categories to make them clearer:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect account information.</strong> We collect information relating to your account.\nFor example, we collect basic registration details like name, email address, birthday, and username and password when you create a Houseparty account.\nYou may be able to share other account-related information with us too, like if you choose to provide a profile photo or telephone number.\nWe collect some information about your friends when you invite or refer them to Houseparty or import your contacts.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect usage information.</strong> We collect information about your interactions with and on Houseparty.\nFor example, we collect information about how long you chat with your friends.\nIf you purchase items, we collect information about what you purchase.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Houseparty uses this info to make the product better for you so you can focus on being present with your friends.\nWe want to do the heavy lifting, utilizing tech to improve the experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect certain information when you link third party accounts or apps to Houseparty.</strong> If you link social media accounts to Houseparty, we collect certain social media account information.\nIf you link your contacts we collect information about your friends, like their phone numbers and addresses.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect location information.</strong> For example, we may collect your zip code and state.\nBased on your IP address, we also derive location information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect feedback information.</strong> We collect information that you give us when you complete a survey or participate in a contest or promotion.\nThis includes when you write a review or make a suggestion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect device information.</strong> We collect information about the browser or device you are using.\nWe may look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.\nWe may also collect device identifiers.\nFor example, this might include your operating system and hardware model.\nThis may also include your mobile carrier.</p> Why We Collect Information <p>Now that you know what we collect, we want to tell you why and what we do with that information.\nBelow we explain how we use information:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We use some information to communicate with you.</strong> We use information to respond to your questions, including questions about our services or your relationship with us, and to communicate with you about this policy or our Terms.\nWe may also contact you about your feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We just want to be able to be responsive to you, and occasionally reach out to hear how it\u2019s going on Houseparty, and make sure you have updates on what\u2019s going on with us!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We use some information so you can participate in Houseparty and to enhance your experience.</strong> We use information to process your registration and to empower you to use certain features.\nWith your permission where required by law, for example, we use information to suggest other users with whom you may want to connect.\nWe also use information so you can invite new people to join Houseparty and to provide or suggest specific features.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We help you find friends and make connections.\nFor example, we might suggest a connection to you based on your friends on who could be a good addition to the party.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We use some information to improve our products.</strong> We use information to make Houseparty better, for example by saving certain preferences you choose, tracking events in Houseparty, and recording other performance data.\nWe use this information to customize your experience, analyze product trends, and to develop and improve our products.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We use some information for marketing purposes.</strong> We use your information to share updates about new products and special offers, including promotions, surveys, and contests, through email, on our app, or on social media platforms.\nWe might also use this information to tell you about products and offers, new features, or updates.\nThese might be our own offers or products or select third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We use information to protect our company and users.</strong> We use information to protect our company and users, for example to identify fraud and secure, protect accounts, and protect Houseparty.\nThis includes looking into potentially prohibited or illegal activity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We may also use push notifications in our mobile apps.</strong> We may send you push notifications about updates and other information we think you will find interesting, for example to let you know when a friend is online.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our basis for processing European information.</strong> Our basis for processing your information for the reasons described above is typically to perform a contract, including responding to your requests.\nFor example, this includes providing customer service.\nWhere this applies, if you choose not to provide information, we may be unable to perform the contract or respond to your request.\nWe also process information based on your consent.\nWhere you have provided consent, you have the right to withdraw it.\nWe also use information about you when we have a legitimate purpose in doing so.\nFor example, this includes helping secure and improve Houseparty.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We also use information as otherwise permitted by law.</strong>\n</p> How We Collect Information <p>Like many other companies, there are different ways that we collect information, which we\u2019ve outlined below:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect information directly from you.</strong> You might provide us information in several ways.\nFor example, we collect information when you create an account, contact us, or participate in a survey.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We collect information passively.</strong> We use tracking tools to collect information from you passively.\nThese tools include things like browser cookies and web beacons.\nWe use these on our sites and in emails that we send to you.\nWe collect this information about users over time when you download and use our app.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The information we gather helps us give you the best experience on Houseparty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We get information about you from third parties.</strong> Social media platforms and third-party apps may give us information about you.\nWe may also collect information about you from other users.\nThis might include your name, phone number, or email address if they invite or refer you to our app or if they have linked their contacts to their Houseparty account.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What social platforms are we talking about? We might get information, for example, from Snapchat or Facebook if you choose to link your Houseparty account with these third-party platforms.\nInformation they share with us includes certain details from your profile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We combine information.</strong> Houseparty is an integrated social media platform, which means we may combine information that we have collected across devices, such as computers and mobile devices.\nWe may also combine information we get from a third party with information we already have and combine information that we have collected from other third-party sites.</p> When We Share Information <p>Houseparty is part of the digital community, and as part of our business there are times that we share information with third parties.\nYou can find out more about that here:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sharing on Houseparty.</strong> Houseparty is designed to let you join video chats with not only your connections but also the connections of others.\nIf someone who is not your direct connection joins your video chat session you will get a notice.\nYour public profile is available to both your connections and their connections.\nOther users may also be able to view your name, username, and top Connections (i.e., who you speak to most often).\nConnections can see when you were online last and a list of some of your other Connections, and receive a notice when you go online and are \u201cin the house.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Houseparty exists to help you connect with the people you care about most.When you connect with your friends, they can see some of the profile information you\u2019ve created on Houseparty.\nWant to change things up? Read about modifying your controls in the \u201cyour choices\u201d section below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We share information with our vendors.</strong> We may share information with trusted third parties, including companies who serve as our vendors and help us deliver our services and social media partners if you elect to use social media integration features.\nWe may also share some information with companies that help operate our app or run a promotion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What can we say? We can\u2019t do it alone.\nSometimes we have to work with other companies to help us deliver a great Houseparty experience.\nWe are owned by Epic Games, this means that we might rely on them to help us out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves.</strong> For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena or if a U.S.\nor non-U.S.\nlaw enforcement agency, government agency, or investigatory body requests it.\nWe may also share information we collect when we investigate potential fraud, abuse, or other similar violations of Houseparty rules and codes of conduct.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.</strong> If all or part of our business is sold, we\u2019re part of a merger or acquisition, or there is a financing or bankruptcy, we may share information as part of that transaction.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We may also share information for other reasons we may describe to you or as permitted under law.</strong>\n</p> Your Choices <p>You have certain choices about how we use your information.\nThose are described here:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can opt out of certain marketing.</strong> To stop receiving our promotional emails or communications follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us.\nIf you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive non-marketing messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can control certain aspects of your interactions with others on Houseparty.</strong> Houseparty is meant to offer a fun way for people to interact with other people in ways similar to how you might in-person.\nAny Connection of a participant in a video chat session may join an unlocked chat session, with or without an invite from you and whether or not you know him or her.\nHowever, your settings do give you certain controls over your video conversations, chats, and Facemails.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We believe in respecting social norms.\nIf one of your friends\u2019 friends is about to join your Houseparty chat, you\u2019ll receive a notice that they are joining.\nIf you don\u2019t want friends of friends joining your party, you can \u201clock\u201d the conversation.\nAnyone in the room can unlock the group session to allow more people to join, just like at a real house party.\nYou can learn more about this in our Party Guidelines in the app.\nYou can also choose \u201cPrivate Mode\u201d to have your rooms always locked by default.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>You can control certain notifications about being online.</strong> If you don\u2019t want your friends to know that you\u2019ve launched the app, then you can \u201cSneak into the House.\u201d This is a one-time selection.\nYou can also select online notification preferences for yourself and friends in your notification settings.\nWhen you launch the app, you\u2019re starting a party and others may be able to immediately join you unless you \u201clock\u201d the room.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can control cookies and tracking tools.</strong> Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools.\nHow you do so depends on the type of tool.\nCertain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.\nTo control flash cookies, which we may use on certain websites from time to time, you can go here.\nWhy? Because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Do Not Track Policy:</strong> You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies.\nNot all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies.\nIn some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause Houseparty not to work as intended and some features may not be available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>You can control certain settings on your mobile device.</strong> For example, you can turn off the location services or push notifications on your phone.\nTo modify the push notifications you get from us, you can change your preferences in Houseparty settings.\nYou also can modify app level permissions, such as location collection, through your device settings.\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance also offers a tool for opting out of the collection of cross-app data on a mobile device for interest-based advertising.\nTo exercise choice for companies participating in this tool, download the AppChoices app here.\nChoices you make are both browser and device specific.</p> You May Have Certain Additional Rights <p>In some places laws grant residents certain additional rights.\nWe have described those rights in the relevant sections here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read on to learn more about different rights we offer depending on your location.\nA lot of these rights have to do with your ability to ask us for more information.\nYou can reach us using the contact information listed in the \u201ccontact us\u201d section below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>European Residents.</strong> If you are an EEA, Swiss, or UK resident,

governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>You and Life On Air agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court (a \u201cSmall Claims Action\u201d) and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (an \u201cIP Protection Action\u201d).\nThe exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\nUnless you timely provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the Section titled \u201cYour Choices\u201d), you acknowledge and agree that you and Life On Air are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.\nFurther, unless both you and Life On Air otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p> Arbitration Rules <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/mediation or by calling the AAA at 1\u2013800\u2013778\u20137879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p> Arbitration Process <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p> Arbitration Location and Procedure <p>Unless you and Life On Air otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Life On Air submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p> Arbitrator\u2019s Decision <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nLife On Air will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p> Fees <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Life On Air will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p> Changes <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cGeneral Terms\u201d section below regarding changes to these Terms, if Life On Air changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by

notifying you of such change.\nBy rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Life On Air in accordance with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p> Your Choices <p>If you don\u2019t want to settle Disputes by arbitration as described above, you will notify Life On Air by sending us written notice (including by email to hello@houseparty.com telling us that you don\u2019t want to use arbitration, within thirty (30) days of the date on which you agreed to these Terms (such notice, an \u201cArbitration Opt-out Notice\u201d), and consequently you agree that all Disputes will be resolved exclusively by a court located in San Francisco, California.\nIf you don\u2019t provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except for a Small Claims Action and an IP Protection Action as set forth above.</p> 13.\nGeneral Terms <p>The failure of Life On Air to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.\nIn the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nLife On Air\u2019s failure to enforce any right or provision

information:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>We use some information to communicate with you.</strong> We use information to respond to your questions, including questions about our services or your relationship with us, and to communicate with you about this policy or our Terms.\nWe may also contact you about your feedback.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We just want to be able to be responsive to you, and occasionally reach out to hear how it\u2019s going on Houseparty, and make sure you have updates on what\u2019s going on with us!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>We use some information so you can

governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p> Agreement to Arbitrate <p>You and Life On Air agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court (a \u201cSmall Claims Action\u201d) and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party\u2019s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (an \u201cIP Protection Action\u201d).\nThe exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.\nUnless you timely provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice (as defined below in the Section titled \u201cYour Choices\u201d), you acknowledge and agree that you and Life On Air are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.\nFurther, unless both you and Life On Air otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.\nIf this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will be deemed void.\nExcept as provided in the preceding sentence, this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p> Arbitration Rules <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) then in effect, except as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section.\n(The AAA Rules are available at https://www.adr.org/mediation or by calling the AAA at 1\u2013800\u2013778\u20137879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p> Arbitration Process <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.\n(The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA\u2019s roster of arbitrators.\nIf the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p> Arbitration Location and Procedure <p>Unless you and Life On Air otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.\nIf your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Life On Air submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nSubject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p> Arbitrator\u2019s Decision <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award.\nJudgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant\u2019s individual claim.\nIf you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.\nLife On Air will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p> Fees <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.\nHowever, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Life On Air will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p> Changes <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the \u201cGeneral Terms\u201d section below regarding changes to these Terms, if Life On Air changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by

notifying you of such change.\nBy rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Life On Air in accordance with the provisions of this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p> Your Choices <p>If you don\u2019t want to settle Disputes by arbitration

San Francisco, California.\nIf you don\u2019t provide Life On Air with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any dispute except for a Small Claims Action and an IP Protection Action as set forth above.</p> 13.\nGeneral Terms <p>The failure of Life On Air to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.\nIn the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.\nLife On Air\u2019s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision.\nThe waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Life On Air.\nExcept as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies
