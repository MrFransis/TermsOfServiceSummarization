what we need it for (purposes).\nThis is set out below, by reference to what the information is required for.\n</p>\n<p> We collect and process your personal information in order to offer the Network,

to register you for certain account services.\n</p>\n<p> Account registration information </p>\n<p> We need to collect your personal information for account registration purposes.\nAlthough the Network provides for anonymous and pseudonymous participation, in some instances in order to use certain Products or Services, we require account registration.\nThis requires a name associated with your account, an email address at which we can contact you, and in some cases, additional information including, a contact address, a billing address, and a password to help secure your personal information.\n</p>\n<p> Profile information </p>\n<p> When completing a public \u201cprofile\u201d, whether it is for use with the Network or our Products and Services, we may require you to share

authorized users of your private Network account.\nWhile some of the public and private Network profile information is required, much of it is within your control as we describe herein and can be modified, updated, and restricted by you in your Profile Settings.\n</p>\n<p> Information we use to identify and authenticate you.\nWe need this information to be able to recognize you, for example, when you access your accounts.\nIt also helps us to protect your details and keep them secure.\n</p>\n<p> Marketing and sales information, e.g.\ndetails of the services you receive and your

Stack Overflow Network, and certain of our Products and Services, we collect location information about you including your IP address, your location, browser information, and how you came to the Stack Overflow Network.\nThis is the case for individuals who have registered for an account, and non-members who engage with the Stack Overflow Network by visiting our website(s) but who have not completed an account registration.\n</p>\n<p> This information is collected for various purposes, including advertising, analytics and to serve content as it relates to certain Products or Services (e.g., Talent), as well as to provide you with localized content, recommendations, and marketing.\nYou may revoke our permission to collect some of this data, including your location and browser information through your Account Settings, but this may limit functionality in some cases.\nCertain location information we collect is required for security and site functionality.\nWe share this information with

details are vaulted through a third-party payment gateway.\nStack Overflow will store an encrypted token along with the last four digits of the credit card and the expiration month and year of the card and will not store or retain any other billing information about you.\n</p>\n<p> Developer Survey </p>\n<p> As the world\u2019s largest developer community, Stack Overflow publishes an annual Developer Survey to provide key insights into the developer community, as well as other surveys from time to time, all of which include demographic (e.g.\ngender, race, age etc) and certain personal information.\nYour participation in the Developer Survey as well as any other Stack Overflow survey is entirely voluntary.\nIn order to provide meaningful insights into the developer community, Stack Overflow may collect sensitive data about you, including, but not limited to your gender, race, sexual orientation, immigration status, and your location.\nWe consider this data to be among our most sensitive, and have taken elevated measures to protect such data as well as to de-identify your name and other personal information from such data.\nWe restrict such data within Stack Overflow on a privileged basis to only those that need to see it and while we may share your personal information with certain third parties such as researchers, we do so only after imposing contractual obligations of confidentiality on such third parties and only where absolutely necessary for limited research purposes.\n</p>\n<p> When we publish our surveys, they are published as a compilation of anonymized data, which means that we take every effort to ensure that your information is understood in a statistical narrative decoupled from your personal identity.\n</p>\n<p> If you have any questions concerning the Developer Survey or other survey and our security measures to protect your sensitive personal data, please contact us at: privacy@stackoverflow.com.\n</p>\n<p> Legal basis for processing your information </p>\n<p> We will only use your information where we have a legal basis for using it, for example, where we have your consent, or where we need to carry out processing to provide you with a service you have requested.\nThis section describes the legal bases we rely on for processing your information, including when we share it with third parties.\n</p>\n<p> When you access the Stack Overflow Network and use the Products and Services we offer, we collect, display, store, share, transmit, and process your information in the manner described in this policy.\n</p>\n<p> In order to carry out these activities, Stack Overflow may rely on the following legal bases in order to process your personal data: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Where you have given us consent to process the information, which you can withdraw at any time.\n</li>\n<li> Where the processing is necessary: <ul>\n<li> to carry out the contractual obligations in the Terms of Service or to provide the Products and Services you have requested </li>\n<li> to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims </li>\n<li> to protect the public interest or vital interest of others </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li> Where it is in our legitimate interests, or that of a third party to carry out the processing.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Whenever we rely on legitimate interests for processing, we ensure that we consider and balance our interests against the individual\u2019s interests before processing.\nWe do not use your personal data on the basis of legitimate interest for activities where individuals\u2019 interests override our interests.\n</p>\n<p> Where we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do so in order to: </p>\n<p> Secure your personal data and information </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow is committed to the safety and security of your personal data and the information that you share with us and with the public.\nWe treat your personal data and safety from harassment as top organizational priorities.\nAt Stack Overflow we consider it necessary to pursue these legitimate interests in order to keep our community, you and your information safe from spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, identity theft, and the scraping and unlawful collection of your information.\n</p>\n<p> Provide and optimize products and services </p>\n<p> We use your information to provide and improve our Products and Services, for identification, verification, to provide support, for online and offline marketing including through third party tools such as Google Analytics, and for general research and analytics reporting.\nIn doing so, we may learn which of our Products and Services you are using most, what you\u2019re interested in, and to better enable you to use and access our Products and Services.\nAs a core part of our business, Stack Overflow has a legitimate interest in enabling and customizing your experience of our Product and Services offerings.\n</p>\n<p> Engage in commercial transactions </p>\n<p> As part of providing our core Products and Services, Stack Overflow may charge you for the use of some Products and Services, or certain features within these Products and Services.\nIn order to process your payment, and to secure your financial information, we may facilitate the sharing of your information with third parties.\nWe share your information only with third parties who have met strict security standards and consider the secure processing of your financial information to be a strict and legitimate business necessity.\n</p>\n<p> Comply with regulatory and legal obligations </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow has a legitimate interest in complying with certain legal obligations and interests which, from time to time, may require the disclosure of your personal information.\nStack Overflow will not disclose your personal information to legal authorities except where such disclosure is by lawful request, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement demands (including a subpoena, court order, or other lawful legal demand by a legal authority with lawful jurisdiction).\nIn some cases, we may also release your personal information to defend our legitimate legal interests.\nWe consider our obligation to protect the Stack Overflow community from imminent physical harm to be both a legitimate business interest as well as to be within the public interest and may disclose your personal information if we believe you or another individual may be in imminent danger of harm to yourself or to another.\n</p>\n<p> Marketing and product communications </p>\n<p> From time to time, Stack Overflow may communicate with you about commercial and other Product and Services offerings.\nIn doing so, we provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such messages at any time you choose via your account settings.\nStack Overflow will not sell your personal information to enhance our marketing opportunities or profitability (except as may relate to a corporate event such as a sale or merger), and as we are committed to preventing spam, our direct marketing efforts are limited in scope and frequency.\nWe engage in such activities as a legitimate business interest in order to promote key Products and Service offerings and provide you with every opportunity to unsubscribe from such communications or to further limit their scope and frequency.\nIn short, while we want to communicate some key commercial communications with you and have determined it to be a legitimate interest for us to be able to do so, you have the final say in whether or not you would like to receive such commercial communications from us.\nYou can review or change your permissions in your Profile Settings.\n</p>\n<p> Core business operations </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow may engage with third parties in business transactions including the buying and selling of assets, the auditing of our business practices and financials, and to engage in business development opportunities.\nThese core activities may involve the processing and/or disclosure of some limited personal information which may be necessary and within our legitimate interests to develop the Stack Overflow brand and business.\nIf we transfer any personal information in pursuing such a business transaction, we will always ensure that strict confidentiality measures are in place to protect your privacy interests.\n</p>\n<p> YOUR CHOICE AND CONTROL OF THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON YOU </p>\n<p> Privacy is a guiding principle of all Stack Overflow Products and Services and we value your privacy.\nTo this end, we provide you with the ability to control how your information is stored, and what information is collected.\nYou may change or correct your account settings and choose not to share certain information by creating a pseudonymous account.\nAdditionally, much of the data we collect is voluntary and your choice entirely to provide us or not.\nYou may also remove certain optional information that you no longer wish to be publicly displayed, such as your photo, or job history.\nIn the event Stack Overflow decides to provide additional opt-out or opt-in mechanisms under the Privacy Shield Framework, the mechanisms will be clear, conspicuous, and readily available for you to exercise your choice.\nAnd of course, should you wish, you may also request the permanent deletion of your account, in which case all personal information collected on you will be removed from our servers and encrypted (except, in some cases your IP address required for security purposes, site maintenance, and spam protection).\n</p>\n<p> We also provide you additional data control options created by the GDPR, but provided to the Stack Overflow community regardless of geographic location with respect to your information, including data access and portability (including the right to obtain and download a copy of the personal data you provided to Stack Overflow), data correction (the ability to update the personal data we collect and display on you, in many cases via your account settings), data deletion (where Stack Overflow will delete personal information stored on you, which we are not required by necessity to maintain), and the ability to have us stop processing your personal data (with certain exceptions as may be necessary).\nYou may submit data requests to privacy@stackoverflow.com.\n</p>\n<p> Please also be aware that in order to respond to data requests and provide data choices to you, we may need to first verify your identity.\n</p>\n<p> You may additionally control the receipt of certain marketing and advertising communications from Stack Overflow.\nSome messages that we send are required, and related to our legal obligations, or service related and mandatory.\nOther messages, like marketing and advertising communications are provided by us to let you know how you can continue to share, learn, and build your knowledge within the Stack Overflow community, and are voluntary.\nWe provide you with the opportunity to control which voluntary (non-mandatory/required) messages you would like to receive in your Profile Settings.\n</p>\n<p> ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT ON YOU WHEN YOU USE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS </p>\n<p> When you register for our services or if you or your organization set up a Private Network, we may collect some additional information in connection with that service or product.\nThis section describes in further detail the information we collect on you and how we use that information broken down by our Products and Services offerings.\n</p>\n<p> Click below for links to the Privacy Notices for each of our Products and Service

through, or on behalf of its entities located in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the EEA.\nWe may transfer your information to companies working on our behalf and to other third parties and agents located outside the European Economic Area.\n</p>\n<p> Please be aware that the privacy laws and standards in certain countries outside the EEA, including the rights of authorities to access your personal information, may differ from those that apply in the country in which you reside.\nWe will transfer personal information only to countries to which we are permitted by law to transfer personal information and we will continue to ensure that your personal information is appropriately safeguarded.\nMore information on this is provided within the policy.\n</p>\n<p> INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow is a global community and as such, you may access the Stack Overflow Network from almost anywhere in the world.\nWhen you do this, you will also be subject to the local laws of your jurisdiction you are accessing it from.\nBy accessing the Stack Overflow Network and engaging with our Products and Services, you acknowledge that your personal data may be collected and transferred from your local jurisdiction (including member states to the European Union) to the United States.\n</p>\n<p> Where Stack Overflow transfers your personal data from your local jurisdiction (including member states to the European Union) we rely on certain lawful transfer mechanisms to do so, including the following lawful bases for such transfers: </p>\n<p> Privacy shield </p>\n<p> Stack Overflow complies with the EU - US Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss - US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.\nStack Overflow has certified (note: certification under legal name Stack Exchange, Inc.) to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles including onward transfer principles as amended by the GDPR where applicable.\nStack Overflow acknowledges accountability under the onward transfer principles of the Privacy Shield Framework when transferring data to third parties.\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.\nStack Exchange, Inc.\nis subject to the investigative and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.\nUnder certain circumstances, you may invoke binding arbitration to determine, for residual claims, whether Stack Overflow has violated its Privacy Shield obligations, and whether any such violation remains fully or partially unremedied.\nStack Overflow has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the PrivacyTrust Shield Program, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United Kingdom.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint from Stack Overflow, or if we have not addressed your concern to your satisfaction, please contact us: privacy@stackoverflow.com or visit https://privacytrust.com/drs/stackexchange or at the contact information provided below.\n</p>\n<p> Standard contractual clauses </p>\n<p> The European Commission has adopted standard contractual clauses (also referred to as model clauses), which provide safeguards to protect the transfer of personal information outside of the European Union.\nWe may use these standard contractual clauses when transferring personal information outside of the European Union.\nYou may review and request a copy of such standard contractual clauses as used by Stack Overflow by contacting us at legal@stackoverflow.com.\n</p>\n<p> OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY </p>\n<p> Security is important to us and we know it is important to you.\nStack Overflow follows generally accepted standards to protect your personal information when processing, transferring, and storing your personal information including Transport Layer Security (\u201cTLS\u201d), by restricting your personal

\u201cNetwork\u201d), owned and operated by Stack Exchange, Inc.\n(\u201cStack Overflow\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), a Delaware corporation.\nStack Overflow welcomes you to the Network, the largest community of developers in the world, and invites you to participate in the community by sharing knowledge with your peers and colleagues.\nLike all communities, we ask that you participate in a manner that respects your fellow community members.\nTo that end, we provide you with these terms of service to advise you of the legal obligations you assume when you engage with the Stack Overflow community or otherwise access or use the public Network or any services provided on the public Network (collectively, \u201cServices\u201d).\nThese terms govern the use of the public Network (the \u201cPublic Network Terms\u201d).</p>\n<p>To the extent you are accessing or using our other products on behalf of a Company or Team, including without limitation by registering for an account on behalf of a Company or Team, your use of those products (such as Stack Overflow for Teams or Stack Overflow Business) is governed by their relevant Terms and Conditions.</p> 1.\nPublic Network Terms <p>Please read these Public Network Terms carefully before accessing or using the public Network.\nThese Public Network Terms constitute an agreement between Stack Overflow and you and governs your permitted use of the public Network ONLY, including any Services or Products that are part of the public Network.\nBy accessing or using the Services or the public Network in any manner, including without limitation by visiting or browsing the public Network or registering for an account on the Network, you affirm that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Public Network Terms, as well as the Acceptable Use Policy and Privacy Policy.\nStack Overflow reserves the right, at its discretion, to modify these Public Network Terms at any time by posting revised Public Network Terms on the public Network and by providing notice via e-mail, where possible, or on the public Network.\nYou shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications.\nYour access to or use of the Services or public Network following such modification constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Public Network Terms as modified.\nTo reiterate, and for clarity, these Public Network Terms apply to all who access or use the Services or public Network, including without limitation users who contribute content, information, and other materials or services, registered or otherwise.</p>\n<p>PLEASE BE AWARE THAT BY USING THE PUBLIC NETWORK, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cMANDATORY ARBITRATION\u201d BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p> 2.\nContracts are Binding and Legally Enforceable -- Please Read! <p>As stated above, these Public Network Terms constitute an agreement between Stack Overflow and you and governs your use of the public Network.\nThese Public Network Terms do NOT govern the use of our Talent, Enterprise and other Stack Overflow products and services that are not part of the public Network.\nIn the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of these Public Network Terms and any such service or licensing agreements, the terms and conditions of the Public Network Terms shall prevail.</p> 3.\nAge Eligibility <p>You must be at least 13 years old to access or use the Network or Services, including without limitation to complete a Stack Overflow account registration.\nBy accessing or using the Services or the Network in any manner, you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years of age.\nIf you are under 13 years old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, access or use the Services or Network in any manner, and may not provide any personal information to or on the Services or Network (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).</p>\n<p>If you are located within the European Union, you must be at least 16 years old to access or use the Network or Services, including without limitation to complete a Stack Overflow Account Registration.\nBy accessing or using the Services or the Network in any manner, you represent and warrant that you are at least 16 years of age.\nIf you are under 16 years old, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, access or use the Services or Network in any manner, and may not provide any personal information to or on the Services or Network (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number or email address).</p> 4.\nAccess to the Public Network <p>Any user of the public Network is welcome to participate in community discussions, to answer questions, and to share their hard earned knowledge with public Network community participants, provided that they comply with the obligations set forth in these Public Network Terms, and to the extent that use of the public Network does not conflict with the applicable laws, rules and regulations of the user\u2019s jurisdiction.\nStack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network if it determines, in its sole discretion, that you have in any way violated these Public Network Terms or are otherwise ineligible to access or use the Network or Services.\nIf your actions are determined by us to violate these Public Network Terms, Stack Overflow may, in its sole discretion, try to remediate that violation by working with you individually, but is under no obligation to do so, and if any such remediation efforts are unsuccessful (in Stack Overflow\u2019s sole discretion), then Stack Overflow may revoke your rights to the Network.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that these Public Network Terms are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you, and the right to access the Network or any Services is revoked where these Public Network Terms or use of the Network or any Services is prohibited or conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>\n<p>Stack Overflow will use reasonable efforts to make the public Network available 24/7/365, but from time-to-time we will have scheduled outages for maintenance purposes and other upkeep.\nWhere feasible, we may, in our sole discretion, make efforts to inform you about any outages and report on the nature and reason for any outages that may occur in an open and transparent manner, though we are under no obligation to do so, and in any case will not be liable for any downtime.</p> 5.\nUser Obligations <ul>\n<li>To access some of the public Network features you will need to register for an account as an individual and consent to these Public Network Terms.\nIf you do not consent to these Public Network Terms, Stack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network.</li>\n<li>You are solely responsible for ensuring that your account registration is complete and remains up to date.\nYou have the right to discontinue use of, or terminate, your account whenever you like, and subject to our Privacy Policy, control the use and sharing of your account information.\nPlease note that any content or information you share publicly is governed by the terms described below in the section titled \u201cContent Permissions, Restrictions, and Creative Commons Licensing,\u201d and you should be aware that once you place content in the public sphere, you willingly give up some rights and control over such content.</li>\n<li>Stack Overflow strongly encourages you to review our Privacy Policy, which explains how we will handle, process, and use your personal data, and with whom, and how we will share this data.</li>\n<li>Stack Overflow is a community and we expect you to treat each member of the Stack Overflow community with respect.\nWhether a community member is asking their first question, or is a reputation superstar, we respect you and welcome you, but we also require you to be kind to one another.\nTo prevent bad actors from creating a negative community experience, we have outlined what we believe to be common sense rules for community participation and reserve the right to pause or terminate your account if you engage in disruptive, abusive, or nefarious behavior outside of Stack Overflow\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Public Network Terms.</li>\n<li>You are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to or access the Network or otherwise use the Services, including without limitation modems, hardware, software, and long distance or local telephone service.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Services and Network.</li>\n<li>Some premium or additional features of Stack Overflow (including without limitation Stack Overflow for Teams) may require a payment obligation for access and use.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that your payment obligations, if any, remain current and not in arrears.\nIn the event Stack Overflow charges for features you will be clearly notified of the terms of any payment obligations and provided the opportunity to refuse such obligations before you incur any charges.\nPlease note, however, that your refusal to accept payment obligations may result in your inability to access or use certain premium or additional features of Stack Overflow.</li>\n</ul> 6.\nContent Permissions, Restrictions, and Creative Commons Licensing Stack Overflow Content <p>All materials displayed or performed on
