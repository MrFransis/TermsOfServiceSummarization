infringed.\nIMPORTANT: please include your copyright registration number.\nIf your work is not yet registered, please include a copy of the application to register the work that you filed with the

any material that in our view constitutes fair use.\nIf we identify you as a \"repeat infringer,\" we will block or remove your images and terminate any accounts you have with us.\n(If we notify you of a DMCA removal and you respond with a legitimate counter-notice, that won't count toward being a repeat infringer.)

information <p> Our servers automatically collect the following information regarding devices that access our site or app: device characteristics (including device ID for mobile devices), operating system, browser type, IP address, username from stored cookies if present, dates and times of each login, page and image viewing statistics, and incoming and outgoing links.\nWe also log the metadata associated with any uploaded images.\nWe use this automatically collected anonymous data to analyze how our site and app are used so as to keep them optimized, to determine the popularity and usefulness of various features, to maintain the integrity of user accounts so that each user can see his or her posts and the upvotes, downvotes, and comments to them, and to enable users with usernames to access their posts, albums, and membership information.\n</p>\n<p> None of this information is \u201cpersonal information\u201d \u2013 that is, data we could use to identify a specific person.\nWe also provide automatically collected anonymous data to third party advertisers and analytics companies to supplement the tracking information described below, but we contractually prohibit such third parties from combining such anonymous data with other data they may have in a way that could enable the identification of individuals.\nWe also use such data to enable us to comply with copyright law, with 18 USC \u00a72258A (illegal content), and to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including national security, courts, and law enforcement.\n</p> Interactively collected information <p> In addition to the automatically collected anonymous data described above, we may place information on your device and then retrieve it later: we may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve our server's interaction with your device.\nWe also partner with third party advertisers who may (themselves or through their partners) place and/or recognize cookies on your device that collect data about which pages and ads are viewed while our app or site is being used.\nAdvertiser cookies enable customized ads that are selected for display on your device based on the anonymous information collected.\nNo personal data is on, connected to, or derivable from, these cookies.\nIf you block or disable cookies and other tracking technologies, instead of getting customized ads you will see non-customized (generic) ads.\nAlthough our servers currently don't respond to \"do-not-track\" requests, you can block tracking in other ways.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies for interest based advertising, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ or see the section below, \u201cAccessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data\u201d.\n</p>\n<p> Imgur participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance's (DAA) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.\nFor more information please visit http://www.aboutads.info.\n</p> Information you choose to give us <p> When you sign in with a username, we handle it in the same way as an automatically collected username except that if you don\u2019t allow cookies, you have to enter your username each time you log in.\nA username is, by nature, publicly posted information.\nOn occasion we may run a contest or other type of promotion, and to enable us to award prizes to the winners as well as to comply with the applicable laws, we collect real names and contact information \u2013 so if you win a contest, we\u2019ll ask for that information and we\u2019ll use it only for those two specific purposes.\n</p>\n<p> We collect whatever personal data about you that you choose to give us, such as a contact email address (which we do not make public) and profile information.\nWe do not require you to use an account to upload images.\nIf you open an account you do not have to provide any personal information except your cell phone number, which we don't retain.\nwe use it once to send you a code.\n(See below.) If you are located in the EEA and wish to open an account, <em>do not use your real name \u2013 choose a username and email address that reveal nothing about your identity.</em> If you give us an email address, we\u2019ll probably send you promotional messages once in a while.\nwe\u2019ll try to make them fun and interesting but of course you\u2019ll be able to opt out at any time.\nWe may work with outside companies to deliver targeted advertising to you while ensuring that no personal information about you is ever used.\nfor example, we may generate a one-way hash from the email address you provide and provide only the hash to the outside companies, who track only the hash.\nA hash can never be reversed to reveal your email address or any other personal information.\nthe process is explained below.\n</p> Why do I have to verify my phone number? <p> To keep everything fun, we\u2019ve come up with a new way to send miscreants north of the wall! And without collecting any personal information from you.\n</p>\n<p> To set up an account, you give us your cell phone number and we\u2019ll text you a confirmation code to verify that it\u2019s your number.\nBut we won\u2019t save your number, share it, sell it, or even show it to anyone.\nInstead, we\u2019ll one-way encrypt it into a hash and save <u>only the hash</u>.\nSince a hash can\u2019t be decrypted, we can\u2019t get your phone number from it.\nThen, if you get banned for breaking the rules, we\u2019ll ban your hash too \u2013 and you won\u2019t be able to set up another account with the same phone number, since it would generate the same hash.\nClever, huh? </p>\n<p> For more information, see our community rules.\n</p> Information you post <p> Imgur does not \u201ccollect\u201d the stuff you post: images, comments, messages, etc., and \u2013 with respect to persons in the EEA \u2013 does not \u201cprocess\u201d or determine any purposes for processing of any information that you manifestly make public.\nIn particular, every image uploaded to Imgur is public \u2013 whether uploaded directly without going through a user account, or uploaded via a user account \u2013 and has its own URL.\nNo matter what your privacy settings are, every image can always be accessed and viewed by anyone who types in that exact URL.\nNo image uploaded to Imgur is ever completely hidden from public view.\nThis is mainly to ensure that Imgur, which allows anonymous postings, will not be used as a platform for illegality.\nSo too for messaging: Imgur allows users to send messages to one another both indirectly (via comments to posts) and directly (via chat).\nImgur's messaging functionality is not intended to be a secure messaging platform.\nit's just for fun.\nTo ensure that Imgur's messaging platform is not used as a platform for illegality, all messages are public.\nNo messages are ever completely hidden from public view.\nWe may monitor user messaging.\n</p> Post / Image Privacy <p> Uploading a New Post creates a \u201cpost\u201d (also called \u201calbum\u201d) that can be shared to the community.\nThe individual images inside the post are referred to as \u201cimages.\u201d<br>\n</p>\n<p> Although nothing you post to Imgur is completely hidden from public view or entirely private, with that understanding you can set the privacy level of posts.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Hidden: Posts will be hidden by default.\nThey are not searchable within Imgur, and will not appear in Imgur\u2019s public gallery or public profile, but each one will still be accessible by going to the post\u2019s URL.\nThey cannot receive comments or earn points.\n</li>\n<li> Public: Posts will be publicly viewable and shared with the community.\nPublic posts shared with the community will allow comments, sharing, and voting, and appear in a user\u2019s profile.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> \u201cFavorite Folders\u201d Privacy <p> You can add favorited posts to folders that you create.\nIndividual public posts that you favorite are always visible from the \u201cAll Favorites\u201d page in your user profile and cannot be hidden, even those within folders.\nFavorited hidden posts will not appear publicly in your favorites.\nThese settings for favorites cannot be changed, but the visibility of folders can be toggled to public or private.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Public: Folders are visible to the public community on your public profile.\n</li>\n<li> Private: Private folders are kept hidden from your public profile.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p> Accessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data <p> Because we don\u2019t collect information about the identity of our users and don\u2019t receive any information from third parties enabling us to identify our users, we have no means of knowing, or providing you with information about, whatever anonymous data about you we might have on our servers \u2013 unless you have a username.\nIf you have a username, you may log in and access your data, correct whatever information you deem to be incorrect, opt out of information sharing with our advertisers, or delete your account.\nFor legal reasons we may retain backup and/or archival copies of information prior to your corrections, amendments, or deletions.\n</p> Data Protection <p> We take every reasonable precaution to protect the data on our servers from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, taking into account the risk level and the nature of the data.\nYou are responsible for taking every reasonable precaution on your end to protect any unauthorized person from accessing your Imgur account.\n</p> GDPR <p> Imgur does not collect \u201cpersonal data\u201d about, or monitor behavior of, \u201cdata subjects\u201d as those terms are defined in GDPR Art.4(1), nor do we \u201ctarget\u201d individuals in the EEU.\nRegarding the latter, see Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3), Ver.\n2.1 (07 Jan 2020).\nTo contact us regarding privacy issues, you can email us at privacy@imgur.com, or snailmail us at Imgur, Inc., 268 Bush St.\n#3133 San Francisco, CA 94104 </p> Dispute resolution <p> These terms are governed by California law, excluding its conflicts of law principles, and if there is a lawsuit between a user and Imgur, jurisdiction and venue will lie exclusively in the State where the defendant is located, if within the United States, or in Santa Clara County, California otherwise.\n</p> Changes to this Privacy Policy <p> We may revise our privacy policy from time to time by posting the changes here.\nYou can determine the date of the most recent changes by looking at the \u201ceffective date\u201d at the top.\n</p> Print Imgur's Privacy Policy Love Imgur?
