in full of the subscription and other fees according to Atera\u2019s then-current price list as published on the Site (\u201cFees\u201d).\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Fees are based on the number of Permitted Users designated in the Order Form, even if a smaller number of Permitted Users ultimately use the Service in a given Subscription Period (however, use of the Service or your

jurisdiction which requires you to deduct or withhold taxes or other amounts from any amounts due to us, you must notify us in writing.\nIn such a case, we reserve the right to assess the withheld amount or to increase the gross amount of the applicable payment so that, after the deduction or withholding for taxes, the net amount paid to us will not be less than the amount we would have received without the required deduction or withholding.\nThe available payment methods and the required payment schedule are set forth in the Order Form.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>7.4.\nPayment Processing.\nThe Order Form may enable you to purchase a subscription and pay the Fees online by using your credit card or other online tools or services.\nIf you choose to do so, such payment will be

keep your information safe in addition to things like Single Sign-On user authentication, and encryption of data in transit and at rest.\nHowever, no means of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and while we endeavor to use commercially reasonable means to protect personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp.\nIf you access our Services via a third-party CRM platform or Cloud calendar (GSuite, Outlook 365), you should also protect your account with secure account credentials and prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Retention.\nSubject to the rights of users set forth above, we\u2019ll retain information for as long as we need it to provide you the Services or to

servers and back-up storage.\n(2) we will not delete Anonymized Data and may continue to use it as describe in this Privacy Policy.\nand (3) we may retain information if necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, manage security risks, or enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nInternational Transfers.\nStandard Contractual Clauses\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We are a global

based on customer location and the applicable Service being used.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have taken appropriate safeguards to ensure that your Personal Data will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nFor instance, we have implemented the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal data, which requires the protection of personal data processed from the European Economic Area in accordance with European Union data protection laws a copy of which can be obtained at:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32010D0087.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nAccountability for Onward Transfers.\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ATERA shall enter into contracts to ensure that any third party to whom Personal Data may be disclosed is aware of and adheres to the principles contained in this Privacy Policy and/or is otherwise compliant with applicable laws and regulations mandating an adequate level of privacy protection.\nIn all circumstances, ATERA shall ensure by contract that any such third party (a) is aware of the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.\n(b) is subject to laws providing the same level of privacy protection as is required by these principles.\nand (c) has contractual safeguards in place to protect the Personal Data.\nWe shall also, upon notice, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing by third parties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ATERA is not required to identify the sources of personal data when such identification is not possible through reasonable efforts, or where the rights of persons other than the affected data subject would be violated.\nIf there are compelling grounds to doubt the legitimacy of a data subject\u2019s request for rectification, amendment or deletion of his or her Personal Data, we may require further justifications before performing the Data Subject\u2019s request.\nWe are not required to notify third parties to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed of any rectification, amendment or deletion when such notification involves a disproportionate effort or unreasonable burden.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nSecurity\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ATERA undertakes reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Personal Data, whether in electronic or tangible, hard copy form.\nWe shall also take reasonable steps to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\nCollection from Minors\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>ATERA does not knowingly collect personal information from minors who are under the age of 16 through the Services.\nIf a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without his/her consent, then he or she should contact ATERA as described below.\nIf we become aware that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information from our files.\nFurther, the
