standard has not yet been developed.\nWe may honor \u201cdo not track\u201d signals in the future.\nYou may, however, disable certain tracking by disabling cookies or opting-out of targeted advertising as noted below.</p>\nK.\nCookies\n<p>We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to improve our Services and provide you with the best possible experience.\nWe use cookies to track your preferences and purchases as you navigate through our Site and to save you from having to re-enter information every time you visit our Site.\nBy using cookies to track your visits, we can make your next shopping experience on our Site better.\nTo search our Site and/or place an order, you need to have the cookies feature of your web browser turned on.\nWe may also use technologies, such as our own cookies, to provide you with personalized online display advertising tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>Some cookies are necessary to make the Site work properly.\nThese cookies can be disabled, but the Sites and Services may not work properly.\nOther types of cookies go towards functionality, personalization, performance or analytics, which are optional.\nThese optional cookies may be disabled should you elect to opt-out from having them collected from you.</p>\n1.&nbsp;Types of Cookies\n<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer\u2019s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes.\nSome cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate Our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at Our Site and Services.\nThere are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Session Cookies.</em>\n</strong> Session cookies exist only during an online session.\nThey disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.\nWe use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into Our Site.\nThis allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through Our Site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Persistent Cookies.</em>\n</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.\nWe use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.\nThe Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.\nVisitors to Our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>\n2.&nbsp;Local Storage Objects\n<p>We may use Flash Local Storage Objects (\u201cFlash LSOs\u201d) to store your site preferences and to personalize your visit.\nFlash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.\nTypically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.\nFor more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the Adobe Flash Player Help Page, choose \u201cGlobal Storage Settings Panel\u201d and follow the instructions.\nTo see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose \u201cWebsite Storage Settings Panel\u201d and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</p>\n3.&nbsp;Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags and Other Technologies\n<p>Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.\nIn contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.\nWe may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.\nweb beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with Our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Our Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about site usage.\nWe and our third-party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>\n4.\nThird-Party Analytics\n<p>We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of Our Site.\nWe also may use other analytic means to evaluate Our Site.\nWe use these tools to help us improve Our Site\u2019s performance and user experiences.\nThese entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (Flash LSOs), to perform their services.\nTo learn more about Google\u2019s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.\nYou can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cross-Device Use.</strong> We and our third-party service providers, including Google, may use the information that we collect about you (whether directly from Our Site, through your device(s), or from a third-party) to help us and our third-party service providers identify other devices that you use (e.g., a mobile phone, tablet, other computer, etc.).\nWe, and our third-party service providers also may use the cross-device use and other information we learn about you to serve targeted advertising on your devices and to send you emails.\nTo opt-out of cross-device advertising, you may follow the instructions set forth in the Third-Party Ad Networks section below.\nPlease note: if you opt-out of these targeted advertising cookies, your opt-out will be specific to the web browser or device from which you accessed the opt-out.\nIf you use multiple devices or web browsers, you will need to opt-out each browser or device that you use.</p>\n5.\nThird-Party Ad Networks\n<p>We use third-parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on Our Sites, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third-party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.\nNetwork advertisers are third-parties that display advertisements based on your visits to Our Site as well as other websites.\nThis enables us and these third-parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested.\nThird-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.\nThese third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third-party\u2019s specific privacy policy, not this one.\nWe may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of Our Site and our Services, as well as aggregate or de-identified information about visitors to Our Site and users of our Services.</p>\n<p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\u201cNAI\u201d) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (\u201cDAA\u201d).\nFor more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp (NAI) and www.aboutads.info/choices (DAA).</p>\n<p>Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.\nIt does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on Our Site or other websites.\nYou may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.\nAlso, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.\nAdditional information is available on NAI\u2019s and DAA\u2019s websites accessible by the above links.</p>\nL.\nSummary of Information

health, growth and development of infants and children.\nIf a mother elects to formula-feed her infant, reversal of her decision may be difficult.\nPartial feeding with infant formula could have a negative effect on establishment of breastfeeding.\nInappropriate use of breast milk substitutes may lead to infant malnutrition, serious illness, and even death in all countries.\u201d</p>\n<p>Misuse of breast milk substitutes poses health hazards, therefore, read and follow preparation and storage instructions carefully.\nBreastfeeding involves additional nutritional requirements for lactating mothers.\nIt is important, therefore, that a nursing mother have an adequate diet to ensure that the quantity and nutritional quality of her milk is adequate for her baby.\nFormula, when used properly, provides a sound nutritious substitute or supplement to breast milk, but it is more expensive.\nWhen deciding how to feed your baby, professional advice should be followed and cost of formula considered.</p>\n<p>The names of Mead Johnson Nutrition products shown on this site are trademarks of Mead Johnson Nutrition (or of a licensor where stated), many of which are registered in
