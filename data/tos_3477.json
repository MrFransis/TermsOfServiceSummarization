us at privacy@poki.com.</p>6.\nLinks to third party websites<p>The Poki General Site knowingly links out to the following third party websites.\nThe names of these third party websites link to their privacy policy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>YouTube</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Instagram</li>\n<li>Whatsapp</li>\n<li>Twitter</li>\n<li>Kik</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the third party games published on the Poki General Site and Poki Kids Site do link out to third party websites.\nPoki uses technology and people to monitor these links for inappropriate content but it does not have full control over the third party games on the Poki Site.</p>7.\nSharing information<p>Poki may share your persistent identifiers with third parties such as business partners under the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>Security: We may release information about our Users, including IP address, when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing the Poki Site and applicable laws.\nWe may also disclose such user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Poki, or any of our respective business partners, customers or others.</p>\n<p>Aggregate Information: We may disclose non-identifying, aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties.\nExamples of such non-personal information include the number of users who visited this Poki Site during a specific time period or played a specific game on this Website.</p>\n<p>Advertising: We may share technical information such as IP address or device ID with our advertising partners.\nFor advertising on the Poki General Site, this information may be used to serve behaviorally targeted ads or profiling.\nFor advertising on the Poki Kids Site, this information will only be shared for the purposes of serving contextual advertising and capping the frequency of ads.</p>8.\nInternational Data Transfers<p>Poki may work with third parties that are based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), and may transfer data about you to the countries in which these parties reside.\nWhenever we share personal data originating in the EU with an entity outside of the EEA, we will do so on the basis of the EU standard contractual clauses, with your consent, or because such transfer is necessary performance of a contract.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about our policy regarding international data transfers, please contact us at privacy@poki.com</p>9.\nChildren Users<p>We recognize the importance of safeguarding the privacy of children and encourage parents to check and monitor their children's use of online activities regularly.\nThis is why we created a separate age-appropriate experience for Children Users through the Poki Kids Site, or through an age-gate in certain games on the Poki General Site: in order to comply with the legislation, you could be presented to an age screen when starting the game.\nWhen presented with this age screen, it is important that you state the correct age.\nBased on your age information and your device settings, Poki does not process personal data of children under the minimum age limit (Children Users) that is prescribed by the legislation in the individual jurisdictions for behavioral advertisement.</p>\n<p>The Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site, and the Poki Kids Site supports and complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (\"COPPA\").\nThe Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site and the Poki Kids site will not request any personal information from Children Users.\nThere is no registration required for the Poki Kids Site and any advertising shown on the Poki Kids Site, or in the the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site, is age-appropriate.\nThe Poki Kids Site and the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site will not show behaviorally targeted ads or allow third parties to track the activity of Children Users for that purpose.</p>\n<p>The Poki Kids Site and the the Children Users' experience of games with an age-gate on the Poki General Site may collect and use IP addresses and other persistent identifiers, including cookies, from Children Users, but only for purposes of supporting our internal operations, such as to help us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify whether you are a child or adult for data protection purposes to determine the legal requirements for our processing of your data</li>\n<li>Maintain or analyze the functioning of the Poki Kids Site</li>\n<li>Perform network communications</li>\n<li>Authenticate users of, or personalize the content on, the Poki Kids Site</li>\n<li>Serve contextual advertising on the Poki Kids Site and cap the frequency of advertising</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have separated our platform into a few sections.\nPoki Kids was created for our youngest audience and is fully COPPA compliant.\nIf you are a Child User, you should only use the Poki Kids Site and only with the permission of a parent or legal guardian.\nOn Poki.com, you'll find games that are intended at users that are over 13.\nPoki.com is not targeted towards children under the age of 13 and it will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>\n<p>To learn more about COPPA, please reference this simple one-page informational guide from the kidSAFE Seal Program: https://www.kidsafeseal.com/knowaboutcoppa.html.</p>10.\nLawful Bases for Processing Personal Data<p>If you are an individual in the European Union (EU), we collect and process data about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.\nThis means we collect and process your data only when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your individual privacy interests), such as preventing fraud, improving the Service, and increasing the security of the Service and network infrastructure;</li>\n<li>You have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;</li>\n<li>It is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations.\nor</li>\n<li>It is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you have the right to object.\nMore information on exercising this right can be found in section 11 addressing Individual Rights.\nSome examples of our legitimate interests and the data being processed include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network and information security (IP address, user/device ID)</li>\n<li>Customer Support and fraud prevention (email address)</li>\n<li>Improving our products and services (activity logs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time.\nIf you wish to withdraw your consent, please contact us using the information in section 12 regarding the Contacts for Individual Rights Requests.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us at privacy@poki.com.</p>11.\nIndividual Rights<p>Poki makes certain choices available to you when it comes to your personal data.\nPlease review the below information outlining your choices and how to exercise them.\nWe will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe.\nIf our full response will ever take more than a month due to complexity or scope, we will notify you of this and keep you updated.\nWe may request more information to confirm your identity before acting on any request.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Review and update your data:</u> You have the right to access and update any personal data that we have collected.\nTo review or update this data, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Delete your data:</u> You also hold the right to have your personal data deleted.\nThis is sometimes known as the 'right to be forgotten'.\nTo request that we delete all personal data about you, please submit a request using the contact information at the end of this section.</p>\n<p>After you delete your personal data from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not immediately remove data from our backup systems for archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.\nWe may also decline to honor this request in certain specific situations, such as if the data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to exercise/defend a legal claim.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Restrict Processing:</u> You have the right to restrict how we process your personal data in certain circumstances.\nThis is an alternative to requesting the deletion of your data.\nRather than requesting we delete all of your personal data, you may request that we limit our uses of your personal data to specific purposes.\nYou may wish to request we restrict our processing if you contest the accuracy of your personal data and we are working to verify this information, or if you want us to retain your personal data in connection to a legal claim but cease processing it.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Data Portability:</u> You have the right to obtain copies of your information in a structured, commonly used format that you can move your data between our service and the services of others.\nWe may request more information to confirm your identity before providing any personal data.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Right to Object:</u> You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes or when our processing of your data is based on legitimate interests.\nYou may request that we stop processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.\nThis is an absolute right and we cannot refuse this request.\nBeyond direct marketing, if you wish to exercise this right, you must give specific reasons why you object to our processing of your data, based on your particular situation.\nEven after receiving such a request, we may continue processing if it is necessary for the exercise/defense of a legal claim or if we can demonstrate a compelling legitimate ground for the processing.</p>\n<p>If any request made under this section is clearly unfounded or excessive, we may reject the request or require a reasonable fee to honor the request.\nIf we decide to reject your request, we will inform you of the reasons for not taking action and provide information on other possible remedies.\nIf we decide that a reasonable fee is necessary, we will promptly inform you and will comply with the request upon receipt of this fee.</p>12.\nContact for Individual Rights Requests<p>Please use the below information when submitting a request to exercise any of the above rights.\nPlease do not submit requests across multiple communications channels.\nWe will make all efforts to respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<p>\n<u>Email:</u> privacy@poki.com</p>\n<p>\n<u>Physical Mail:</u>\n<br>Poki

without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.</p>13.\nRevisions to this Privacy Policy<p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes.\nIf we update this policy, changes will be reflected on this page and we will update the \"last updated\" date above.\nWe will obtain prior parental consent for any changes we make if those changes affect Children Users in a way that requires parental consent under
