address and contact information, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested by you.\nYou must send any notice of Dispute by email to Vendor at legal@avast.com (stating Subject: Section <u>11</u> Notice of Dispute Under EULA).</p>\n<p>11.3.\nANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nYOU WILL NOT SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.\nNO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p>11.4.\nIf you and Vendor do not resolve any Dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the Dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the United States Federal Arbitration Act (\u201c<i>\n<u>FAA</u>\n</i>\u201d), 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq., and the substantive laws of the State of New York (without regard to choice of laws principles).\nExcept as provided in Section <u>11.5</u> below, you are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in litigation as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury.\nInstead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right to judicial review under the FAA.\nAny court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p>11.5.\nThe arbitration requirement of this Section <u>11</u> is subject to the following exceptions:</p>\n<p>11.5.1.\nYou may litigate any Dispute in small claims court, in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside, if the Dispute meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court.\nIf you initiate a claim in small claims court, you are responsible for all court costs and fees.</p>\n<p>11.5.2.\nAll Disputes concerning any alleged misappropriation of your or Vendor\u2019s intellectual property will be resolved in court.</p>\n<p>11.5.3.\nIf you are a consumer and live in the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein, you may be entitled to address your Dispute through an internet platform for online dispute resolution established by the European Commission (the \u201c<i>\n<u>ODR Platform</u>\n</i>\u201d).\nThe ODR Platform is intended to facilitate out-of-court resolutions relating to online purchases of goods and services between consumers and traders based in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Lichtenstein.\nYou will find the ODR Platform by following this link: http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/.</p>\n<p>11.6.\nAny arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the \u201c<i>\n<u>AAA</u>\n</i>\u201d) in accordance with the AAA\u2019s \u201cConsumer Arbitration Rules\u201d effective September 1, 2014, including the \u201cCosts of Arbitration (Including AAA Administrative Fees)\u201d effective September 1, 2014 (collectively, the \u201c<i>\n<u>Consumer Procedures</u>\n</i>\u201d) and will be subject to the following:</p>\n<p>11.6.1.\nThe Consumer Procedures provide for certain fees, specifically allocating some to the consumer (you) and others to the business (Vendor).\nIf your claim is US$75,000 or less, Vendor will pay all of those specified fees and costs, including those allocated to the consumer.\nVendor does not agree to bear any other costs.\nIf your claim is more than US$75,000, the Consumer Procedures will govern payment.</p>\n<p>11.6.2.\nExcept as provided in below, the AAA\u2019s Consumer Procedures will be applied to any Dispute between the parties.\nHowever, pursuant to Consumer Arbitration Rule R-1(e), a party may raise the proper application of the Consumer Arbitration Rules to an arbitrator for a final decision.\nThis Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Consumer Procedures.\nYou will commence arbitration only in the county or other similar political subdivision in which you reside.\nThe arbitration proceedings will be conducted by conference call.\nHowever, if the proceedings are conducted pursuant to the AAA Consumer Procedures, the arbitrator(s) will have the discretionary authority to require a face-to-face hearing upon the request of a party.</p>\n<p>11.6.3.\nYou and the Vendor agree that the use of the AAA to administer arbitration is not integral to the parties\u2019 agreement to arbitrate Disputes.\nIf the AAA will not or cannot conduct an arbitration, you and Vendor will negotiate in good faith to agree on a sole arbitrator who will resolve the Dispute as provided in the Consumer Procedures.\nIf the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, a court of competent jurisdiction may appoint an arbitrator, who will follow the AAA\u2019s Consumer Procedures.</p>\n<p>11.6.4.\nIf one or more parts of this Section <u>11</u> are found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then, and only in that circumstance, those parts will be severed and the Dispute will be resolved subject to all remaining parts of this Section <u>11</u> and all other provisions of this Agreement.\nIf such severance results in all or some parts of a Dispute proceeding in a court of law, exclusive jurisdiction for any such court proceeding will be the courts sitting in the county of New York, New York, U.S.\nFor purposes of any such court proceeding, you consent to, and will not challenge, the New York, New York courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction over you, and you further waive objection based upon improper venue or forum non conveniens and will not seek transfer to another district or jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>11.7.\nNotwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this Section <u>11</u>, if you acquired a Solution for other than personal or household use, the arbitration proceedings, including the payment of costs, will be administered in accordance with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules (the \u201c<i>\n<u>Commercial Procedures</u>\n</i>\u201d).\nThe Commercial Procedures are appropriately applied to any Dispute between the parties, and you will not advocate otherwise in any proceeding.\nHowever, this Agreement governs to the extent it conflicts with the Commercial Procedures.</p> 12.\nGeneral <p>12.1.\n<u>Notice</u>.\nVendor may at any time deliver any notice to you via electronic mail, pop-up window, dialog box or other means, even though in some cases you may not receive the notice unless and until you launch a Solution.\nAny such

<p>Generally speaking, we need some personal data particularly to provide you our products and services, optimize and improve our products and services, to send you direct marketing, or to comply with our legal obligations.\nWe try to minimize the collection of any data, we aggregate or delete it as soon as possible, and if it is not necessary we don\u2019t collect it at all.\nWe will describe how we process the data in the following sections.\nBut let\u2019s start with what we don\u2019t collect.</p> Our No Logging Policy - data we don\u2019t send to our servers.\nPeriod.\n<ul>\n<li>Originating IP address.</li>\n<li>Any DNS queries while connected.\nWe rely on our own secure DNS servers, so your queries are also protected from exposure to 3rd

person and includes the information you provide to us while using our VPN services.</p>\n<p>More specifically, we may collect and process personal data about you in the following situations:</p> Product functionality Service Data from our VPN servers <p>If you use our VPN service, we collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide and operate it, as well as keep it running safely and efficiently.\nThis is the data we collect to make sure our VPN infrastructure works (\u201cService Data\u201d):</p> Service Data What we use it for Day of connection<br>E.g.\nWe store the date you were connected together with an internal identifier, but not the exact time: timestamps are floored to either 12 am or 12 pm.\nTo troubleshoot for support and abuse handling.<br>\n<br>Example: To know the amount of daily active users.\nRounded amount of data transmitted<br>E.g.\nIf a user transferred within the session 364MB, we floor it to 300MB.\n1843MB of transferred data is floored to 1000MB.\nWe keep just the first digit of the value together with an internal identifier.\nTo plan for new network capacity and server improvements.<br>\n<br>Example: We may deploy more capacity to meet demand and make sure speeds stay up for all users.\n<p>\n<b>We store server\u2019s service data for 35 days</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis \u2014 data created on Jan 3rd, 2020 gets deleted on Feb 7rd 2020, for example.</p> Service Data from our VPN clients <p>In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly and without errors we have to know how many specific errors we have.\nThis data pertains to interactions taken in the app, and cannot be used to uncover what you\u2019re using the VPN service for.</p> Client Data What we use it for Connection events<br>\n<br>Events such as the attempt to connect, disconnection, connection error, etc.\ntogether with an internal identifier exclusively used for this (\u201cconnection event identifier\u201d) To operate and provide VPN service with high quality.\nWe do not pair any individual user with this data.<br>\n<br>Example: How many unknown users get the same error? Application Events<br>\n<br>Events such as auto-connection, uninstall event, etc.\ntogether with an internal identifier (\u201capplication event identifier\u201d) To plan product development and analytics<br>\n<br>Example: How many users do we have? Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular? Are people uninstalling after our latest release? Crash reports generated and sent by the user<br>\n<br>We might collect data like your e-mail, app version or internal identifiers described above.\nTo help troubleshoot the issue.\nWe don\u2019t send any privacy-sensitive data automatically - you need to explicitly allow sending this back to us and check prior to what data is being sent before you share it with us.<br>\n<br>Please note that if you provide us together with information above also your personal data, e.g.\nwithin an ad hoc crash report that you decide to send to us, we could add this information to the service data and might be able to connect it with you.<br>\n<br>Example: App is crashing on some specific device.\nThis is how customer care support can help with device-specific issues.\n<p>\n<b>We store client\u2019s service data for 2 years</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis \u2014 data created on Jan 3rd, 2019 gets deleted on Jan 3rd, 2021, for example.</p>\n<p>Note: if you are using an older version of HMA, our apps may be configured to collect your username.\nWhile we have set our servers to immediately dump this information for all versions of clients, this is still a potential risk to your privacy.\nThe only way to resolve this is to upgrade your VPN app/service to the latest versions.</p> Account creation and management <p>When you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you to use the VPN service), we will need some information about you.\nThis is the personal data that is created and stored for the management of your account:</p> Account data What we use it for Email address To send you purchase receipts, communications, and occasional product news Username (only for legacy versions) To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service.\nWe do not collect this information anymore.\nUsernames are used only with older versions of our VPN clients.\nActivation code To activate your subscription Subscription renewal date To tell us until when the account is valid <p>All of the above data is stored for as long as you use our service, as it is necessary for us to provide it.\nHowever, your Account Data is not paired with your activity usage.\nYou can see all of this data by logging into our Privacy Preference portal.</p> Billing and Payment <p>We rely on third-party payment processors to handle your product purchases.\nYou can find out which provider we are working with for the point of purchase you chose (for example our website, an app store, etc) by looking at your transactional email or receipt.</p>\n<p>This is the list of payment processors we cooperate with and their privacy policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2Checkout - https://www.2checkout.com/legal/privacy/</li>\n<li>Google Play - https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</li>\n<li>Apple iTunes - https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These providers are in the position of independent controllers and may collect a variety of information about you to complete the purchase.\nAll of them are PCI-compliant or the equivalent and are prohibited from using your personal data for anything but facilitating your payment and subscription management or as otherwise described in their applicable terms of service and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Some of that billing data may be shared with us in order to detect and prevent fraud, help with customer support, or used as a record of your payment for accounting, taxation, and invoicing purposes.\nThis data is what we call \u201cbilling data\u201d and it includes your name, address, email address, the product (subscription you purchased) and for how long, and payment information.</p>\n<p>Your payment provider will process your credit card number, but it is not shared with us.</p>\n<p>On our side, billing data is stored for as long as you continue to use our service, and for up to 10 years after that.\nIf legal obligations change, or we need to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, we may be obliged to keep this data longer than that.</p> Communication The Email <p>If you contact us by email, it will be stored for 6 months, unless required by law or other exceptional circumstances.\nWe do this to speed up our turn around on support and to follow up.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a user of our service or you have subscribed on our website, we will send you such commercial communications through this channel in the form of newsletters, or blog notifications.\nPlease note, if you don\u2019t want to be on our mailing list, you may use the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link available in every communication we send you.</p> Livechat <p>When you use our Livechat functionality, we also store the message for 6 months.\nOur Livechat functionality is provided by Zopim (a ZenDesk subsidiary), which may also collect some data subject to their security policy and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you provide us with your personal data we might be able to connect the collected service data with you.</p> Third-party tools used for analytics <p>To analyze application events from our VPN clients in order to understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible.\nHere are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies:</p> Microsoft App Center on macOS.\n<p>Microsoft App Center (former HockeyApp) on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and more.\nThis tool belongs to Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here.</p> Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android <p>Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our service.\nWhile Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, this is not the case of our service because we\u2019ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead.</p>\n<p>As this tool is not necessary for service functioning, you can opt-out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.</p> Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android <p>This Google tool helps us to improve application stability, pinpoint things that don\u2019t work, and improve your experience.\nIts implementation doesn\u2019t contain any information that can personally identify you.</p>\n<p>Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to Google\u2019s privacy policies</p> Deprecated Analytics <p>If you\u2019re still on older versions of our service, the following analytics are embedded in them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them.\nYou can find Facebook\u2019s privacy policy here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions.</p> Extensions Privacy Policy <p>As an optional part of the VPN service, we offer the following free extensions.</p>\n<p>Please read Common Information for overall information about who are we.\nFor other products and services please visit Extensions Privacy Policy, and for information on how we handle website cookies, please visit our Cookies Policy.</p>\n<p>This policy applies to version 1.1.\nFor older versions of this document, please visit the legal archive.</p> Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker <p>The proxy extension is provided as a free tool for online privacy protection.\nBecause of that, we need to gather different data to protect our product from abuse.</p> What personal data Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker processes? <p>If you use the free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker for Chrome and Firefox browsers, this is the personal data that gets collected:</p> Service data What we use it

optimize and improve our products and services, to send you direct marketing, or to comply with our legal obligations.\nWe try to minimize the collection of any data, we aggregate or delete it as soon as possible, and if it is not necessary we don\u2019t collect it at all.\nWe will describe how we process the data in the following sections.\nBut let\u2019s start with what we don\u2019t collect.</p> Our No Logging Policy - data we don\u2019t send to our servers.\nPeriod.\n<ul>\n<li>Originating IP address.</li>\n<li>Any DNS queries while connected.\nWe rely on our own secure DNS servers, so your queries are also protected from exposure to 3rd parties.</li>\n<li>Browsing history.</li>\n<li>Transferred data.</li>\n</ul> Personal Data Use <p>Personal data is understood as any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person and includes the information you provide to us while using our VPN services.</p>\n<p>More specifically, we may collect and process personal data about you in the following situations:</p> Product functionality Service Data from our VPN servers <p>If you use our VPN service, we collect the minimum amount of information needed to provide and operate it, as well as keep it running safely and efficiently.\nThis is the data we collect to make sure our VPN infrastructure works (\u201cService Data\u201d):</p> Service Data What we use it for Day of connection<br>E.g.\nWe store the date you were connected together with an internal identifier, but not the exact time: timestamps are floored to either 12 am or 12 pm.\nTo troubleshoot for support and abuse handling.<br>\n<br>Example: To know the amount of daily active users.\nRounded amount of data transmitted<br>E.g.\nIf a user transferred within the session 364MB, we floor it to 300MB.\n1843MB of transferred data is floored to 1000MB.\nWe keep just the first digit of the value together with an internal identifier.\nTo plan for new network capacity and server improvements.<br>\n<br>Example: We may deploy more capacity to meet demand and make sure speeds stay up for all users.\n<p>\n<b>We store server\u2019s service data for 35 days</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis \u2014 data created on Jan 3rd, 2020 gets deleted on Feb 7rd 2020, for example.</p> Service Data from our VPN clients <p>In order to make sure our VPN clients do their job properly and without errors we have to know how many specific errors we have.\nThis data pertains to interactions taken in the app, and cannot be used to uncover what you\u2019re using the VPN service for.</p> Client Data What we use it for Connection events<br>\n<br>Events such as the attempt to connect, disconnection, connection error, etc.\ntogether with an internal identifier exclusively used for this (\u201cconnection event identifier\u201d) To operate and provide VPN service with high quality.\nWe do not pair any individual user with this data.<br>\n<br>Example: How many unknown users get the same error? Application Events<br>\n<br>Events such as auto-connection, uninstall event, etc.\ntogether with an internal identifier (\u201capplication event identifier\u201d) To plan product development and analytics<br>\n<br>Example: How many users do we have? Is a new client-side feature we introduced popular? Are people uninstalling after our latest release? Crash reports generated and sent by the user<br>\n<br>We might collect data like your e-mail, app version or internal identifiers described above.\nTo help troubleshoot the issue.\nWe don\u2019t send any privacy-sensitive data automatically - you need to explicitly allow sending this back to us and check prior to what data is being sent before you share it with us.<br>\n<br>Please note that if you provide us together with information above also your personal data, e.g.\nwithin an ad hoc crash report that you decide to send to us, we could add this information to the service data and might be able to connect it with you.<br>\n<br>Example: App is crashing on some specific device.\nThis is how customer care support can help with device-specific issues.\n<p>\n<b>We store client\u2019s service data for 2 years</b>, after which time it is deleted on a rolling basis \u2014 data created on Jan 3rd, 2019 gets deleted on Jan 3rd, 2021, for example.</p>\n<p>Note: if you are using an older version of HMA, our apps may be configured to collect your username.\nWhile we have set our servers to immediately dump this information for all versions of clients, this is still a potential risk to your privacy.\nThe only way to resolve this is to upgrade your VPN app/service to the latest versions.</p> Account creation and management <p>When you create an account with us (note: this is necessary in order for you to use the VPN service), we will need some information about you.\nThis is the personal data that is created and stored for the management of your account:</p> Account data What we use it for Email address To send you purchase receipts, communications, and occasional product news Username (only for legacy versions) To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service.\nWe do not collect this information anymore.\nUsernames are used only with older versions of our VPN clients.\nActivation code To activate your subscription Subscription renewal date To tell us until when the account is valid <p>All of the above data is stored for as long as you use our service, as it is necessary for us to provide it.\nHowever, your Account Data is not paired with your activity usage.\nYou can see all of this data by logging into our Privacy Preference portal.</p> Billing and Payment <p>We rely on third-party payment processors to handle your product purchases.\nYou can find out which provider we are working with for the point of purchase you chose (for example our website, an app store, etc) by looking at your transactional email or receipt.</p>\n<p>This is the list of payment processors we cooperate with and their privacy policies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2Checkout - https://www.2checkout.com/legal/privacy/</li>\n<li>Google Play - https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US</li>\n<li>Apple iTunes - https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These providers are in the position of independent controllers and may collect a variety of information about you to complete the purchase.\nAll of them are PCI-compliant or the equivalent and are prohibited from using your personal data for anything but facilitating your payment and subscription management or as otherwise described in their applicable terms of service and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Some of that billing data may be shared with us in order to detect and prevent fraud, help with customer support, or used as a record of your payment for accounting, taxation, and invoicing purposes.\nThis data is what we call \u201cbilling data\u201d and it includes your name, address, email address, the product (subscription you purchased) and for how long, and payment information.</p>\n<p>Your payment provider will process your credit card number, but it is not shared with us.</p>\n<p>On our side, billing data is stored for as long as you continue to use our service, and for up to 10 years after that.\nIf legal obligations change, or we need to resolve disputes and enforce our agreements, we may be obliged to keep this data longer than that.</p> Communication The Email <p>If you contact us by email, it will be stored for 6 months, unless required by law or other exceptional circumstances.\nWe do this to speed up our turn around on support and to follow up.\n</p>\n<p>If you are a user of our service or you have subscribed on our website, we will send you such commercial communications through this channel in the form of newsletters, or blog notifications.\nPlease note, if you don\u2019t want to be on our mailing list, you may use the \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d link available in every communication we send you.</p> Livechat <p>When you use our Livechat functionality, we also store the message for 6 months.\nOur Livechat functionality is provided by Zopim (a ZenDesk subsidiary), which may also collect some data subject to their security policy and privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you provide us with your personal data we might be able to connect the collected service data with you.</p> Third-party tools used for analytics <p>To analyze application events from our VPN clients in order to understand how our services function, or how stable or successful they are, we rely on our own analytics tools as much as possible.\nHere are the third-party tools we use, how we use them, and their privacy policies:</p> Microsoft App Center on macOS.\n<p>Microsoft App Center (former HockeyApp) on older versions of our macOS and iOS apps: This was used to do beta distribution, crash reporting, user metrics, feedback, and more.\nThis tool belongs to Microsoft and you can find their privacy policy here.</p> Google Firebase Analytics on iOS and Android <p>Firebase helps us to understand how people interact with certain aspects of our service.\nWhile Firebase normally relies on Android Advertising ID or iOS Identifier for Advertisers, this is not the case of our service because we\u2019ve opted to use our own anonymizing identifiers instead.</p>\n<p>As this tool is not necessary for service functioning, you can opt-out of providing us with this anonymized application performance data in our application settings.</p> Google Fabric Crashlytics on iOS and Android <p>This Google tool helps us to improve application stability, pinpoint things that don\u2019t work, and improve your experience.\nIts implementation doesn\u2019t contain any information that can personally identify you.</p>\n<p>Both Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics are subject to Google\u2019s privacy policies</p> Deprecated Analytics <p>If you\u2019re still on older versions of our service, the following analytics are embedded in them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook Analytics on older versions of our Android apps: we used to use this to know how many people opened an app, how much time they spent in it, and other information about how they interacted with them.\nYou can find Facebook\u2019s privacy policy here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We highly recommend that you upgrade to later versions.</p> Extensions Privacy Policy <p>As an optional part of the VPN service, we offer the following free extensions.</p>\n<p>Please read Common Information for overall information about who are we.\nFor other products and services please visit Extensions Privacy Policy, and for information on how we handle website cookies, please visit our Cookies Policy.</p>\n<p>This policy applies to version 1.1.\nFor older versions of this document, please visit the legal archive.</p> Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker <p>The proxy extension is provided as a free tool for online privacy protection.\nBecause of that, we need to gather different data to protect our product from abuse.</p> What personal data Free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker processes? <p>If you use the free HMA VPN Proxy Unblocker for Chrome and Firefox browsers, this is the personal data that gets collected:</p> Service data What we use it for Your originating IP address To prevent attacks on our network.<br>\n<br>Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we will cut off the connection.\nDomain names To prevent attacks on our network.<br>\n<br>Example: If someone attempts to use our servers to attack our own infrastructure, we will cut off the connection.\nTimestamp of requests To prevent attacks on our network.<br>\n<br>Example: If someone attempts to attack our servers, we may report the attacker to their ISP or law enforcement.\n<p>We delete all of this data <b>every 30 days</b> on a rolling basis

our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication.\nOtherwise, access is limited to our physical premises.\nPhysical removal of personal data from our location is forbidden.\nThird-party contractors who process personal data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards.</p> Changes to this policy <p>We reserve the
