Media Cookie Policy <p>\n<i>\n<b> Effective January 1, 2021</b>\n</i>\n</p> Cookies and IP Addresses\n<p>1105 Media uses industry standard cookie technology (examples below) in order to maximize customer experience and operational efficiency.&nbsp.\nWhen you visit one of 1105 Media's websites, we may send you a cookie.\nA cookie is a small file which is placed on your computer or device.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.\nEssential Cookies</b>\n<br> These cookies are essential for the operation of our websites.\nWithout the use of these cookies, parts of our websites would not function.\nFor example, we use cookies to help us identify which of our readers have previously registered in order to access premium content on our websites.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.\nAnalytical Performance Cookies</b>\n<br> We use these types of cookies to monitor our websites' performance and how users may interact with it.\nThese cookies provide us with information that helps us provide better products to our users and also to identify any areas that may need maintenance.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>3.\nFunctional Cookies</b>\n<br> Functional cookies are used to remember your preferences on our websites.\nAn example would be saving your \"handle\" name to be used when submitting comments on our websites.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nBehavioral Advertising Cookies/Third Party Cookies</b>\n<br> We use cookies to provide tailored advertising which we believe is relevant to you.\nAdditionally, some of our partners use cookies on our sites in order to provide tailored advertising to you when you subsequently visit sites outside of our network.</p>\n<p>Online behavioral advertising is a way of providing advertisements on the websites you visit and making them more relevant to your interests.\nThis is done by grouping together shared interests based upon previous web browsing activity.\nAdvertising is then displayed to you when you visit a website that matches these interests.</p>\n<p>Behavioral advertising is based upon your web browsing activity over a period of time \u2013 so it's different than advertising you may see when you're looking for something online using a search engine (e.g., Google) or on the website you may be visiting at a particular time.\nAs an example, you may be doing research on products and services related to data Centre virtualization.\nIf a data Centre virtualization provider is conducting an advertising campaign on our network, as you browse the relevant portions of our sites, we may serve you with one of the advertisements of one of their solutions.</p> We may also track IP addresses.\nAn IP address is a number that can identify an Internet Service Provider and country location.\nIt cannot provide personal information.<p>\n</p>How to control the use of cookies\n<p> You are not obliged to accept cookies and may modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies.\nThe browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies that you have got but also allows you to control their use.</p>\n<p>\n</p>You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting all of them.\nYou can also set your browser to not accept cookies altogether.\nIf this option is selected, you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all.\nIt may be possible to set your browser to not accept cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device.\nThis gives you control over what is set on your device, however, it may slow down your browsing experience.<p>\n</p> You may also opt out or change your behavioral advertising cookie preferences by visiting the opt-out page for the Digital Advertising Alliance (U.S.\nresidents and those not in the EU or Canada), the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU residents), or the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (Canadian residents).<p> There are different levels of control too.\nYou are able to prevent just third-party cookies being deployed, effectively opting out of third party behavioral advertising, and some browsers even allow you to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>In order to manage your cookies, please select your browser from the list below and follow the instructions:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Internet Explorer</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Chrome</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safari</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Firefox</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Opera</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Mobile devices:</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Android</strong>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Safari</strong>\n</li>\n</ul> How can I prevent Online Behavioral Advertising? <p>Further to using your browser to controlling the use of cookies, there are also other ways that you can opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising.\nThe \"Your Online Choices\" page provided by the <strong>Internet Advertising Bureau</strong> (IAB), provides an easy way to opt out of behavioral advertising from each (or all) of the networks represented by the IAB.</p> Flash Cookies\n<p> When you use one of our websites that uses Macromedia Flash Player, a small Flash Cookie may be used.\nThe purpose of using these cookies is to store your flash player preferences and enhance your browsing experience.\nFlash Cookies are stored on your computer in a similar way to standard cookies, except they are stored in a different location.\nDue to this, it is not possible to block or manage Flash Cookies directly from your browser.\nIn order to manage or delete Flash Cookies, please visit Adobe's website, which provides full information by <strong>clicking here.</strong>\n</p> Does this Policy Change?\n<p> We may change this Cookie Policy at any time.\nPlease take a look at the date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last updated.\nAny changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on the Service.</p> Useful information about Cookies\n<p> Further information about cookies can be found on the following websites:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>All

collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts and will only use that information for that purpose.</p> 3.\nInformation regarding interest-based advertising.\n<p>1105 Media and/or certain third parties collect information about you for online behavioral advertising (\"<b>OBA</b>\") (also called \"interest-based advertising\") purposes in order for you to receive relevant interest-based advertising on the websites and on other websites, platforms and media channels.\n</p>\n<p> 1105 Media displays ads on both the websites and on third party websites, applications, platforms and other media channels (collectively, \"<b>Channels</b>\").\nWe use Online Data as well as other User Information to send you OBA.\nFor example, if you read an article about a particular subject on our websites, we may use cookies from a vendor to later serve you an advertisement for a particular product or service related to the viewed article.\nThese third party vendors may connect information about pages you visit on the websites with information about pages you visit on other Channels and show you advertising based on this combined information.\nThese advertisements may appear when you are visiting a different section of the websites or on another Channel.\nLikewise, third party vendors may serve you advertisements when you visit the websites based on your interaction with the websites and other Channels.</p>\n<p> Online Data is aggregated with the other information and data we collect as described in this Privacy Policy and/or similar data collected by partners to create groups of users and certain general-interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on (a) demographic or interest data and GeoIP Data, (b) the pages you view and links you click when viewing an email or using our websites and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you enter when using certain search services.\nWe use this information to get a more accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are more relevant to your interests.\nWe store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad personalization targeting separately from your Personal Information.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<b>OBA Involving Third Parties</b>\n<br>\nWe may also sell or transfer Online Data to certain third parties such as advertisers who will use this data to serve ads that they believe are relevant to your interests, and who agree to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\nSome of these third parties may combine the Online Data with their own data about you to form a more detailed picture.<p>\n</p>\n<p> We engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\nWe do not authorize such third party providers to collect Personal Information from our Services for their own purposes.\nExcept as may be set forth elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, this Online Data is retained by 1105 Media for not more than 180 days after which it shall expire.\nHowever, the 180-day period may commence again if the same user subsequently visits or interacts with an ad, email, the websites or a Channel.</p>\n<p> We may also engage third parties for the purpose of recognizing our users and delivering interest-based content and advertisements to them.\nWe may share your User Information with our partners such as your name, postal address, email, or other identifier.\nOur partners may also: (i) collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID, advertising ID, and information about your browser or operating system.\n(ii) combine User Information about you received from 1105 Media with information about you from other sites or services.\nand (iii) place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.</p>\n<p> One of the ways in which we collect this information is through Tracking Technologies such as cookies and web beacons.\nA cookie is a small file downloaded on to a device when a user accesses certain websites.\nCookies are useful because they allow us to recognize your device and provide you with a high level of service and relevant offers.\nMost browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.\nFor more information about our use of cookies and other Tracking Technologies, please visit our <b>Cookie Policy</b>.</p> 4.\nWhat

address -- and in certain circumstances their employer's name, company size and other industry data -- available on a rental or other basis (e.g.\nsale) to third party providers of goods and services, for example, when such information is provided in connection with webcasts, white papers or other sponsored downloads.\nWhile many customers appreciate the communications, they receive from the third-party providers of goods and services to whom we provide lists of our customers, if you no longer wish to receive messages from individual providers, follow the unsubscribe link and instructions at the bottom of the provider's message or contact the third-party provider directly to be removed from their list.<p>\n</p>\n<p> When you use a co-branded service (a service operated with a partner of 1105 Media) or register or otherwise provide information on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected back to that partner.\nThis may include third party service providers whose services are embedded into and/or appear within the websites.\nUse of your information by such partners may be subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<b>Aggregated Data</b>\n<br>\nIn order to help us sell advertising on the websites and otherwise publicize 1105 Media and its brands, we may share aggregate statistics that describe our online audience.\nThose statistics are often based on the information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse the websites and describe, among other things, the demographics of our visitors.<p>\n</p>\n<p> With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey.\n1105 Media will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users' responses in surveys to other participants in the survey.\nWhere surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where 1105 Media advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, 1105 Media reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.\nParticipation in surveys is solely at your discretion.</p>\n<p> We may also disclose User Information that we receive from you and from third party and public sources to third parties whose practices are not covered by this Privacy Policy (e.g., third party providers of goods and services, marketing and advertising companies and agencies, content publishers and retailers).\nIn addition, we provide information to third parties for OBA as discussed above.</p>\n<p> 1105 Media and some of our advertisers use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements and perform related services when you visit the websites.\nOften, these third-party advertising companies employ cookie and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the websites.\nWe also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>\n<p> The Service may utilize framing techniques to serve content from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our site.\nPlease be aware that you may be providing your information to these third parties and not to 1105 Media, or in some cases such information may be shared with both 1105 Media and such third parties.</p> 5.\nHow you can change or control what is
