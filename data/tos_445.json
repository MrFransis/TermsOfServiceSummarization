information from many customers in ways that do not directly identify you.\nFor example, Walmart may combine your shopping history with that of other customers to deliver generalized insights to Walmart\u2019s suppliers.\nThese insights do not identify individual customers.\nThis information helps Walmart suppliers provide products and services relevant to Walmart customers.\nWalmart may receive payment for these insights.</p>\n<p>To deliver information about products and services that may be of interest to you, we may share information with other companies, such as publishers, advertisers and measurement analytics providers.\nFor example, we may share device-related data (such as device identifier, type of device, IP address, cookies and other information associated with

directly, but is necessary to personalize the advertisements you receive.\nWalmart does not receive payment for this information.</p>\n<p>We also allow companies that show advertisements on our webpages or our apps to collect information from your browsers or devices via the use of cookies or other technologies.\nLike many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select

we collect, use, and share your personal information.<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We may send you marketing communications.\nYou can tell us your marketing preferences with Walmart by following the instructions on the Walmart Communication Preferences &amp.\nAlerts page.\nOr you may contact the Privacy Office as described in the <i>\u201cWho Can I Contact at Walmart About the Privacy Policy\u201d</i> section below.</li>\n<li>We also personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements from Walmart or our advertising partners that are tailored to your interests.\nLearn more about interest-based advertising.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of our mobile services use your device\u2019s location information.\nYou can adjust the settings of your mobile device at any time to control whether your device communicates this location information.\nWe may also offer additional controls on our use of your mobile location information.</p>\n<p>We want to offer you choices about the different ways we collect, use, or share your personal information.\nThese choices are described below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Marketing Preferences</b>\n<br>When we are sending marketing communications to you, we use the following standards:<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use an opt-in standard for automated phone and text messages, and for sharing personal information with companies outside our corporate family of companies for their use in direct marketing of their products, such as sending you promotions for their products.\nOpt-in means we will only conduct the activity with your affirmative consent.\n</li>\n<li>We use an opt-out standard for email, app notifications, and postal mail.\nOpt-out means we may contact you, but will stop upon your request (as described below).\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, these standards may not apply to Walmart-branded credit card offerings because these are provided through associated financial institutions.\nHowever, you can choose to stop receiving certain prescreened offers of credit that originate from participating nationwide credit reporting agencies, including our prescreened offers, by calling the official Consumer Credit Reporting Industry organization at 1-888-567-8688 or by going to www.optoutprescreen.com.\n</p>\n<p>If you contact us by email or mail, please be sure to include your full name, the types of communications you would like to receive or not receive, and your related contact information.\nFor instance, if you would like to opt-out of mail, include your mailing address.\nPlease allow sufficient time for your marketing preferences to be processed.\nIt may take up to ten days to process your requests related to email and up to 30 days to process your requests related to telephone calls, text messages, app notification and sharing information with your consent.\nPlease note that postal mailings are often prepared many weeks in advance, and you may continue to receive mail for six to ten weeks.\n</p>\n<p>Since we do not accept opt-out requests from third parties (except as described in the \u201c<i>What are Your California Privacy Rights?\u201d </i>section),<i>\n</i>such as catalog opt-out services, please communicate your request directly to us through one of the mechanisms mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Please know that, even if you opted out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes.\nSome examples are contacts for customer service, product information, service or reminder notices, or recalls.\nWe may also need to contact you with questions or information regarding your order.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Interest-Based Advertising Preferences </b>\n<br>We personalize your experience on our sites and mobile services by showing you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.\nFor example, if you browse or shop for electronics with us or on other sites, we may show you ads for electronics as you continue to browse the Internet.\nFor more information about browsing information see <i>\u201cInformation We Receive from You.\u201d </i>\n</p>\n<p>We show you advertisements related to Walmart or our advertising partners.\nWe belong to ad networks that may use your browsing history across participating websites and mobile services to show you interest-based advertisements.\nYou may also see ads for Walmart on participating websites and mobile services based on how you browse.\nLearn more about interest-based advertising.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Mobile Location Settings</b>\n<br>Some of our mobile services use your device\u2019s location information.\nYou can adjust the location settings of your mobile device at any time to control whether your device communicates this information.\nYou will also need to adjust your device\u2019s Bluetooth settings to completely disable the collection of Bluetooth location-related data.\nSee your device instructions to learn more about these settings.\nIn addition, we may offer you controls on our use of your mobile location information.\n<i>See \u201cWhat Types of Information Do We Collect?\u201d</i> above for more information on the types of location information we collect.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Device Camera and Microphone</b>\n<br>Some of the features on our websites and mobile services may require access to the camera or microphone of your computer or mobile device.\nYou must give your permission before we access your device\u2019s camera or microphone, and you can adjust the settings of your device at any time to control access to your camera or microphone.\n<i>See \u201cWhat Types of Information Do We Collect?\u201d</i> above for more information.\n</p> How Do You
