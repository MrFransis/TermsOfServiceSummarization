- United Kingdom</p>\n<p>Your personal data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent, unless this is necessary to provide the service or to carry out the contract.\nHowever, it may be necessary to share your personal information with individual companies in your country that we use to provide the service.\nThese are exclusively certified Maxon partner companies responsible for your region, who have of course been expressly advised by us to protect the privacy of our customers' personal data.</p>\n<p>For the transmission to our subsidiaries/partner it can happen, that a appropriateness resolution by the EU commission in accordance with Art.\n45 Abs.\n1, 3 DS-GVO does not exist.\nThis means that the EU commission has not yet positively determined that the level of data protection in a given country meets the data protection standards of the European Union based on the DS-GVO.</p>\n<p>Appropriate guarantees such as company-internal and from a supervisory authority approved data protection provisions, for example, or standard EU contracts exist.</p>\n<p>Possible particular risks, which cannot be excluded in conjunction with the transfer of data, are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your personal information can possibly be processed beyond the actual purpose for which it was submitted, for example for additional promotional purposes</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the possibility exists that you will not be able to sustainably enforce or impose your data protection rights, such as your right to information, correction, deletion or data transferability (see point 3)</li>\n<li>A higher probability may exist that an incorrect data transfer can occur and the protection of personal data will quantitively and qualitatively not reflect the comprehensive requirements in accordance with the DS-GVO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A transfer of your personal data to third parties other than for the purpose described herein or in the respective declaration of consent will not take place.\nWe will only transfer your personal data to a third party if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you have given your expressed consent to do so;</li>\n<li>a transfer is necessary for the enforcement or assertion of legal claims and there is no reason to assume that you have in interest in preventing this transfer that is worthy of protecting;</li>\n<li>in the event that a transfer is legally required and this is permittable by law and necessary for contractual settlement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a transfer of data outside of the European Union, the high level of European data protection does not apply.\nFor a transfer it can happen that no appropriateness resolution in accordance with Art.\n45 Abs.\n1, 3 DS-GVO exists for the transfer of data.\nThis means that the EU Commission has not yet positively determined that the country-specific level of data protection meets that of the European Union in accordance with the DS-GVO, which is why we created the aforementioned appropriate assurances.</p>\n<p>Possible risks that may not be completely avoidable in conjunction with the transfer of data are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your personal data may possibly be processed above and beyond the intended purpose.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the possibility exists that you might not be able to sustainably assert or enforce your data protection rights such as those for information, correction, deletion or transfer.</li>\n<li>A high probability may exist that an incorrect processing of data can occur and the protection of your personal data will quantitatively and qualitatively not reflect the requirements of the DS-GVO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<br>III.\nUser rights</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information for those affected</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Each affected person has the right to information in accordance with Art.\n15 DS-GVO, the right to correction in accordance with Art.\n16 DS-GVO, the right to deletion in accordance with 17 DS-GVO, the right to restriction of processing in accordance with Art.18 DS-GVO, the right of revocation in accordance with Art.\n21 DS-GVO and the right to data transferability in accordance with Art.\n20 DS-GVO.\nFor

us any time using the contact information in our Imprint.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Information for filing a complaint</strong>\n</em>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to file a complaint with the authorized data protection supervisory authority about the processing of your personal data by us.\nThe authority responsible for addressing legal issues regarding data protection is the state data protection commissioner of the state in which our company has its seat.\nThe following link offers a list of data protection commissioners in Germany:

personal data can be revoked at any time.\nThis also applies to the revocation of declarations of consent that were given us prior to the new data protection regulations that took effect on May 25, 2018.\nPlease note that the revocation cannot be made retroactively.\nThe processing of data that took place prior to your revocation will remain unaffected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Your rights for data
