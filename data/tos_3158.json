use of the Service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.2 Subscription.</strong> Subject to and conditioned on Organization\u2019s payment of the fees for Subscription Services and compliance with all other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Watermark grants to Organization a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to access and use the Subscription Service solely for the

Responsibilities.</strong> Organization is solely responsible for (i) the content of Organization Data.\nand (ii) its use of the Services, including by and between its End Users.\nEach End User\u2019s access to the Subscription Service is conditioned upon the End User\u2019s acceptance of the Terms of Service (\u201cToS\u201d).\nprovided that Watermark agrees that Organization and its employees shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and therefore Watermark waives compliance by Organization and its employees with any conflicting provisions of the ToS.\nWatermark shall

Service.\nOrganization shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the access codes.\nOrganization shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) attempt to gain access to Watermark\u2019s

information as Watermark may reasonably request, in order to carry out the Services, in a timely matter, and ensure that it is complete and accurate in all respects.\nIf Watermark\u2019s performance of its obligations under the Agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission of Organization or its agents, subcontractors, consultants or employees, Watermark shall not be deemed in breach of its obligations under this Agreement or any Order Form or otherwise liable for any costs, charges or losses sustained or incurred by Organization, in each case, to the extent arising directly or indirectly from such prevention or delay.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.4 Watermark Responsibilities.</strong> In the event that End Users will be paying for their accounts directly, Watermark shall inform Organization when Organization may advise its End Users to begin purchasing accounts and self-registering on the Subscription Service.\nWatermark shall: (a) provide support as specified in any Order Form.\nand (b) perform the Service using personnel of required skill, experience and qualifications and in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally recognized industry

determines that (A) there is a threat or attack on any of Watermark\u2019s IP.\n(B) Organization\u2019s or any End User\u2019s use of Watermark\u2019s IP disrupts or poses a security risk to Watermark\u2019s IP or to any other customer or vendor of Watermark.\n(C) Organization, or any End User, is using Watermark\u2019s IP for fraudulent or illegal activities.\n(D) subject to applicable law, Organization has ceased to continue its business in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar proceeding.\nor (E) Watermark\u2019s provision of the Subscription Service to Organization or any End User is enjoined or otherwise prohibited by applicable law, or threatened to be enjoined or prohibited.\nor (ii) any vendor of Watermark has suspended or terminated Watermark\u2019s access to or use of any third- party or products required to enable Organization to access the Subscription Service.\n(any such suspension described in subclause (i), or (ii), a \u201cService Suspension\u201d).\nWatermark shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide written notice of any Service Suspension to Organization and to provide updates regarding resumption of access to the Subscription Service following any Service Suspension.\nWatermark shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resume providing access to the Subscription Service as soon as reasonably possible after the event giving rise to the Service Suspension is cured.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.6 Additional Terms for Professional Services.</strong> If either party wishes to change the scope or performance of any applicable Professional Services, it shall submit details of the requested change to the other party in writing.\nWatermark shall, within a reasonable time after receiving an Organization-initiated request, or at the same time that it

arising from the change.\n(iii) the likely effect of the change on the Professional Services.\nand (iv) any other impact the change might have on the performance of the Agreement.\nPromptly after receipt of the written estimate, the parties shall negotiate and agree in writing on the terms of such change (a \u201cChange Order\u201d).\nIn addition to any other responsibilities or duties described in this Agreement, the following is a list of obligations for which Organization is responsible, conditions on Watermark\u2019s performance, and assumptions upon which Watermark has relied

upgrades with waived fees in conjunction with Organization participation in a Watermark cohort.\nShould customer subsequently decline to participate in a Watermark cohort, the Implementation fee shall no longer be waived and will be invoiced to Organization.&nbsp.\nOrganization\u2019s purchase of Professional Services, other than Implementation Services, shall expire twelve (12) months from the date of execution of the applicable Order Form.\nNeither party shall be bound by any Change Order unless mutually agreed upon in writing.\nNotwithstanding this provision, Watermark may, from time to time change the Professional Services without the consent of Organization provided that such changes do not materially affect the nature or scope of the Professional Services, or the fees or performance duties set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.7 End User Polls.</strong> Watermark may, from time to time (but no more than quarterly), conduct optional polls of End Users to

and to secure Organization Data.\nEach party agrees to comply with the Data Protection Addendum (\u201cDPA\u201d), posted here, as updated from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.9 Subcontractors and Sub-Vendors.</strong> Watermark may use subcontractors or other third parties in carrying out obligations under this Agreement.\nWatermark remains responsible to Organization for the performance of

and (ii) use Aggregated Statistics to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable law.\nprovided that such Aggregated Statistics do not identify Organization, End Users or Organization\u2019s Confidential Information.\n\u201cAggregated Statistics\u201d means data and information related to Organization\u2019s use of the Subscription Service that is used by Watermark in an aggregate and anonymized manner, including to compile statistical and performance information related to the provision and operation of the Subscription Service.\n\u201dOrganization Data\u201d
