also both agree that:</strong>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice of Dispute.</strong>&nbsp;If either you or&nbsp;we intend to arbitrate under these Terms, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the Dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration.\nNotice to&nbsp;us&nbsp;should be sent either by mail to Verizon Media, Attn: Disputes, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089.\nor disputes@verizonmedia.com.\nNotice to you will be to your email address(es) and street address(es), if any, that we have in our records at the time the notice is

arbitration.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Procedure.</strong>&nbsp;The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms.\nExcept for small claims court cases, any and all Disputes will be resolved by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\").\nThe AAA will apply the&nbsp;<u>Commercial Arbitration Rules</u>&nbsp;to the arbitration of any Dispute pursuant to these Terms, unless you are an individual and use the Services for personal or household use, in which case the AAA's&nbsp;<u>Consumer Arbitration Rules</u>&nbsp;will apply (excluding any rules or

Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Small Claims Court Option.&nbsp;</strong>As an alternative to arbitration, you may bring an individual action in small claims court in your county of residence (or if a business, your principal place of business) or Santa Clara County, California provided that your Dispute meets the requirements of the small claims court.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Location.</strong>&nbsp;Unless you and we agree otherwise, the arbitration must take place, or the small claims action must be filed, in the county of your primary residence or Santa Clara County, California.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Arbitration Fees and Expenses.</strong>&nbsp;We will reimburse any filing fee that the AAA charges you for arbitration of the Dispute.\nIf you provide us with signed written notice that you cannot pay the filing fee, we will pay the fee directly to the AAA.\nIf the arbitration proceeds, we will also pay any administrative and arbitrator fees charged later.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Settlement Offers.</strong>&nbsp;We may, but are not obligated to, make a written settlement offer anytime before or during arbitration.\nThe amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator unless and until the arbitrator issues an award on the claim.\nIf you do not accept the offer and the arbitrator awards you an amount of money that is more than our offer but less than $5,000, we agree to: (a) pay you $5,000 instead of the lower amount awarded, (b) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs, and (c) reimburse any arbitration filing fees and arbitrator fees and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration of your Dispute.\nIf the arbitrator awards you more than $5,000 and we are not challenging the award, then we will pay you the amount of the award.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Severability.&nbsp;</strong>If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure the unenforceable part(s), and the parties will arbitrate their Dispute(s) without reference to or reliance upon the unenforceable part(s).\nHowever, if for any reason the Class Action Waiver set forth below in subsection 14.2.c cannot be enforced as to some or all of the Dispute, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply to that Dispute or portion thereof.\nAny Disputes covered by any deemed unenforceable Class Action Waiver provision may only be litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction, but the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate will be binding and enforceable.\nTo avoid any doubt or uncertainty, the parties do not agree to class arbitration or to the arbitration of any claims brought on behalf of others.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>CLASS ACTION WAIVER FOR U.S.\nUSERS</u>\n</strong>\n<strong>.\nTHESE TERMS DO&nbsp;<u>NOT</u>&nbsp;ALLOW CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATIONS,

necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of third parties, where those legitimate interests are not overridden by your rights or interests.\nOccasionally,
