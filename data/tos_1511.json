process your information </li>\n<li> Your rights over your information </li>\n<li> Where we send your information </li>\n<li> How we protect your information </li>\n<li> How we use \u201ccookies\u201d and other tracking technologies </li>\n<li> How you can reach us </li>\n</ul> Introduction <p>In our mission to make commerce better for everyone at Shopify, we collect and use information about you, our</p>\n<ul>\n<li>merchants using Shopify to power your business</li>\n<li>customers who shop at a Shopify-powered business</li>\n<li>partners who develop apps for merchants to use, build stores on behalf of merchants, refer potential entrepreneurs to Shopify, or otherwise help merchants operate or improve their Shopify-powered business</li>\n<li>users of Shopify apps and services like Shop or Shop Pay</li>\n<li>visitors to Shopify\u2019s websites, or anyone contacting Shopify support</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Privacy Policy will help you better understand how we collect, use, and share your personal information.\nIf we change our privacy practices, we may update this privacy policy.\nIf any changes are significant, we will let you know (for example, through the Shopify admin or by email).</p> Our values <p>Trust is the foundation of the Shopify platform and includes trusting us to do the right thing with your information.\nThree main values guide us as we develop our products and services.\nThese values should help you better understand how we think about your information and privacy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Your information belongs to you <p>We carefully analyze what types of information we need to provide our services, and we try to limit the information we collect to only what we really need.\nWhere possible, we delete or anonymize this information when we no longer need it.\nWhen building and improving our products, our engineers work closely with our privacy and security teams to build with privacy in mind.\nIn all of this work our guiding principle is that your information belongs to you, and we aim to only use your information to your benefit.</p>\n</li>\n<li> We protect your information from others <p>If a third party requests your personal information, we will refuse to share it unless you give us permission or we are legally required.\nWhen we are legally required to share your personal information, we will tell you in advance, unless we are legally forbidden.</p>\n</li>\n<li> We help merchants and partners meet their privacy obligations <p>Many of the merchants and partners using Shopify do not have the benefit of a dedicated privacy team, and it is important to us to help them meet their privacy obligations.\nTo do this, we try to build our products and services so they can easily be used in a privacy-friendly way.\nWe also provide detailed FAQs, documentation and whitepapers covering the most important privacy topics, and respond to privacy-related questions we receive.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Why we process your information <p>We generally process your information when we need to do so to fulfill a contractual obligation (for example, to process your subscription payments to use the Shopify platform), or where we or someone we work with needs to use your personal information for a reason related to their business (for example, to provide you with a service).\nEuropean law calls these reasons \u201clegitimate interests.\u201d These \u201clegitimate interests\u201d include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>preventing risk and fraud</li>\n<li>answering questions or providing other types of support</li>\n<li>helping merchants find and use apps through our app store</li>\n<li>providing and improving our products and services</li>\n<li>providing reporting and analytics</li>\n<li>testing out features or additional services</li>\n<li>assisting with marketing, advertising, or other communications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We only process personal information for these \u201clegitimate interests\u201d after considering the potential risks to your privacy\u2014for example, by providing clear transparency into our privacy practices, offering you control over your personal information where appropriate, limiting the information we keep, limiting what we do with your information, who we send your information to, how long we keep your information, or the technical measures we use to protect your information.</p>\n<p>One of the ways in which we are able to help merchants using Shopify is by using techniques like \u201cmachine learning\u201d (European law refers to this as \u201cautomated decision-making\u201d) to help us improve our services.\nWhen we use machine learning, we either: (1) still have a human being involved in the process (and so are not fully automated).\nor (2) use machine learning in ways that don\u2019t have significant privacy implications (for example, reordering how apps might appear when you visit the app store).</p> Your rights over your information <p>We believe you should be able to access and control your personal information no matter where you live.\nDepending on how you use Shopify, you may have the right to request access to, correct, amend, delete, port to another service provider, restrict, or object to certain uses of your personal information (for example, direct marketing).\nWe will not charge you more or provide you with a different level of service if you exercise any of these rights.</p>\n<p>If you buy something from a Shopify-powered store and wish to exercise these rights over information about your purchase, you need to directly contact the merchant you interacted with.\nWe are only a processor on their behalf, and cannot decide how to process their information.\nAs such, we can only forward your request to them to allow them to respond.\nWe will of course help our merchants to fulfill these requests by giving them the tools to do so and by answering their questions.</p>\n<p>Please note that if you send us a request relating to your personal information, we have to make sure that it is you before we can respond.\nIn order to do so, we may ask to see documentation verifying your identity, which we will discard after verification.</p>\n<p>If you would like to designate an authorized agent to exercise your rights for you, please email us from the email address we have on file for you.\nIf you email us from a different email address, we cannot determine if the request is coming from you and will not be able to accommodate your request.\nIn your email, please include the name and email address of your authorized agent.</p>\n<p>If you are not happy with our response to a request, you can contact us to resolve the issue.\nYou also have the right to contact your local data protection or privacy authority at any time.</p>\n<p>Finally, because there is no common understanding about what a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal is supposed to mean, we don\u2019t respond to those signals in any particular way.</p> Where we send your information <p>We are a Canadian company, but we work with and process data about individuals across the world.\nTo operate our business, we may send your personal information outside of your state, province, or country, including to the United States.\nThis data may be subject to the laws of the countries where we send it.\nWhen we send your information across borders, we take steps to protect your information, and we try to only send your information to countries that have strong data protection laws.</p> Transfers outside of Europe and Switzerland <p>If you are in Europe or Switzerland, your personal information is controlled by our Irish affiliate, Shopify International Ltd.\nYour information is then sent to other Shopify locations and to service providers who may be located in other regions, including Canada (where we are based) and the United States.\nWhen we send your personal information outside of Europe, we do so in accordance with European law.</p>\n<p>If you are in Europe or Switzerland, when we send your personal information to Canada it is protected under Canadian law, which the European Commission has found will adequately protect your information.\nIf we then send this personal information outside of Canada (for example, when we send this information to our Subprocessors), this information is protected by contractual commitments that are comparable to those provided in Standard Contractual Clauses.</p>\n<p>Finally, while we do what we can to protect your information, we may at times be legally required to disclose your personal information (for example, if we receive a valid court order).\nFor information about how we respond to such orders, please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests.</p> How we protect your information <p>Our teams work tirelessly to protect your information, and to ensure the security and integrity of our platform.\nWe also have independent auditors assess the security of our data storage and systems that process financial information.\nHowever, we all know that no method of transmission over the Internet, and method of electronic storage, can be 100% secure.\nThis means we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.\nYou can find more information about our security measures at https://www.shopify.com/security.</p> How we use \u201ccookies\u201d and other tracking technologies <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website and when providing our services.\nFor more information about how we use these technologies, including a list of other companies that place cookies on our sites, a list of cookies that we place when we power a merchant\u2019s store, and an explanation of how you can opt out of certain types of cookies, please see our Cookie Policy.</p> How you can reach us <p>If you would like to ask about, make a request relating to, or complain about how we process your personal information, you can contact us by email at privacy [at] shopify.com, or at one of the addresses below.\nIf you would like to submit a legally binding request to demand someone else\u2019s personal information (for example, if you have a subpoena or court order), please review our Guidelines for Legal Requests.</p> Shopify Inc.<br>\n<p>ATTN: Chief Privacy Officer\n<br>151 O\u2019Connor

websites.\nWe use a number of\ndifferent cookies on the Shopify website, including strictly necessary,\nperformance, advertising, and social media or content cookies.\nCookies\nmake your browsing experience better by allowing the website to remember\nyour actions and preferences (such as login and region selection).\nThis\nmeans you don\u2019t have to re-enter this information each time you return\nto the site or browse from one page to another.\nCookies also provide\ninformation on how people use the website, for instance whether it\u2019s\ntheir first time visiting or if they are a frequent visitor.\nRead more\nabout cookies (and other similar tracking technologies) and how we use\nthe data collected through these technologies, in our Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>What cookies do we use and why?</p>\n<p>Some cookies are necessary to allow you to browse our website, use its\nfeatures, and access secure areas.\nThe use of these cookies is essential\nfor the website to work.\nFor example, we use user-input cookies for the\nduration of a session to keep track of a user\u2019s input when filling in\nforms that span several pages.</p>\n<p>We also use functional cookies to remember choices you\u2019ve made or\ninformation you\u2019ve provided, such as your username, language, or the\nregion you are in.\nThis allows us to tailor your website experience\nspecifically to your preferences.\nFor example, authentication cookies\nare functional cookies that are used for the duration of a session (or\npersistent, if you agree to the \u201cremember me\u201d function) to allow users\nto authenticate themselves on subsequent visits or to gain access to\nauthorized content across pages.\nThe functional cookies we use include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>User-centric security cookies to detect authentication abuses for a limited\npersistent duration, like repeated failed login attempts.\nThese cookies are\nset for the specific task of increasing thesecurity of the service.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multimedia content player session cookies (flash cookies) are used\nfor the duration of a session to store technical data needed to play\nback video or audio content (e.g.\nimage quality, network link speed,\nand buffering parameters).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Load balancing session cookies are used for the duration of the\nsession to identify the same server in the pool in order for the\nload balancer to redirect user requests appropriately.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User interface customization persistent cookies are used to store a\nuser\u2019s preference regarding a service across web pages.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shopify is dedicated to user experience and we use many tools to help us\nimprove our website and our commerce platform.\nTo this end, we use\nreporting and analytics cookies to collect information about how you use\nour website or our merchants\u2019 storefronts, and how often.\nThese cookies\nonly gather information for statistical purposes and only use\npseudonymous cookie identifiers that do not directly identify you.\nThe\nperformance cookies we use include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>First party analytics cookies - We use these cookies to estimate the\nnumber of unique visitors, to improve our websites and our\nmerchants\u2019 websites, and to detect the most searched for words in\nsearch engines that lead to a webpage.\nThese cookies are not used to\ntarget you with online marketing.\nWe use these cookies to learn how\nour websites and our merchants\u2019 websites are performing and make\nrelevant improvements to improve your browsing experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Third party analytics cookies - We also use Google Analytics and\nother third-party analytics providers listed below to help measure\nhow users interact with our website content.\nThese cookies\n\u201cremember\u201d what our users have done on previous pages and how\nthey\u2019ve interacted with the website.\nFor more

you.\nWithout\nthese cookies, the advertisements that you see may be less relevant and\ninteresting to you.\nRead more about how companies use cookies to conduct\ntargeted or retargeted advertising here.\nWe do\nnot set advertising cookies through our merchants\u2019 storefronts\nourselves, though merchants may choose to do so independently.</p>\n<p>Finally, Social and Content cookies are placed

creativity.\nThis includes tangible and intangible works, such as books, text, code, images, videos, logos, and slogans.\nCopyright and trademark are two types of intellectual property.</p>\n<p>Store owners need to protect their intellectual property, and make sure that they don't infringe on someone else's intellectual property.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nAbout copyright\n<p>Copyright protects tangible original works, such as photos on an online store.\n</p>\n<p>Copyright laws vary by country or region, but generally copyright applies from the time the work is created.\nIn many countries or regions, copyrights can also be registered with the government\u2019s copyright office.\n</p>\n<p>A copyright owner has the exclusive rights to copy, display, distribute, sell, or perform their works, or to create derivative works.\nA copyright owner controls how their works are used, and others who want to use their works need to get their permission.\nIf someone uses copyrighted works without permission from the owner, then they might be infringing on the copyright.</p>\n<p>Learn more about copyright on the U.S.\nCopyright Office website or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office's Guide to copyright.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nAbout trademarks\n<p>Trademarks protect unique symbols or words that identify and distinguish a business or product from other businesses or products.\n</p>\n<p>Once registered, a trademark has certain protections under the law, and the trademark owner has the exclusive rights to use the claimed trademark for certain products or services.\nIf someone uses a trademark without permission in a way that causes confusion about the brand, product or services, then they might be infringing on a trademark.</p>\n<p>Learn more about trademark on the United States Patent and Trademark Office website.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nDropshipping and intellectual property\n<p>If you dropship products, then you can choose which products, services, and suppliers you work with.\nYou should also consider the risks because some suppliers might list copyrighted, branded or trademarked goods.\nLearn more about copyright disputes or trademark disputes.</p>\n<p>Some product categories that carry a higher risk of being copyrighted, branded or trademarked goods can include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clothing\n</li>\n<li>designer bags\n</li>\n<li>watches\n</li>\n<li>cosmetics\n</li>\n<li>electrical items\n</li>\n<li>toys\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also refer to <em>how to avoid counterfeit goods on AliExpress</em>.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nCopyright policy\n<p>It is Shopify\u2019s policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\u201cDMCA\u201d), the text of which can be found at the U.S.\nCopyright Office website, https://www.copyright.gov.</p>\n<p>It is expected that all users of any part of Shopify will comply with applicable copyright laws.\nIf, however, we receive proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to such notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating the user\u2019s account.</p>\n<p>In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, Shopify will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nReporting copyright infringement\n<p>You can sign in to use the online form to report content on Shopify that you believe violates or infringes your copyright.\n</p>\n<p>You can also report multiple stores that are infringing on the same copyrighted works in a single form submission.\nIf you falsely report that content infringes on your copyright, then you might be liable for damages.</p>\nCopyright notice requirements\n<p>The online form is the most efficient way of submitting a copyright infringement notice.\nIf you can't use the online form, then you can mail a notice that has all of the information that\u2019s required in the DMCA to Shopify's designated

offline.\n</p>\n<p>If you have a good faith belief that the content was taken offline as a result of a mistake or misidentification, then you can submit a counter notice.\nThe email includes a link to a counter notice form.</p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t use the counter notice form, you can send a counter notice to Shopify's designated agent.\nYour counter notice needs the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.\n</li>\n<li>Your name, address, and telephone number.\n</li>\n<li>The following statements: <ul>\n<li>I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district

questions that you might have.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nTrademark policy\n<p>It is Shopify\u2019s policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged trademark infringement.\nOur response to such

circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\nReporting trademark infringement\n<p>You can sign in to use the online form to report content

05, 2021.\nFor the current version, visit https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/privacy/cookies.\n<p>Countries and regions around the world have introduced regulations that dictate how businesses collect, handle, and share their customer\u2019s data.\nCollecting customer data, especially cookie data and other data related to browsing activity, is essential to merchants looking for insights on their customer\u2019s behaviour.\nThis data also helps merchants advertise to customers on third-party marketing platforms.</p>\n<p>To help merchants comply with these regulations and build trust with their customers, Shopify provides a variety of apps, features, and developers tools.</p>\n<p>You can install the Customer Privacy Banner app created by Shopify, or browse the Shopify App Store for third-party privacy banners.</p>\n<p>When making a decision about what your business needs to do to comply with various privacy regulations it\u2019s important to consult with your lawyer.</p> On this page <ul>\n<li>Data sharing with ad networks</li>\n<li>Tracking European customers and GDPR compliance</li>\n<li>Third-party sale of California customer data and CCPA compliance</li>\n<li>Opting out of targeted ads</li>\n</ul> Data sharing with ad networks\n<p>To improve your marketing campaigns, your customer data is used to optimize and personalize the ads targeting existing and prospective customers.\nAd networks require personal information about your customers to match those same customers in their network.</p>\n<p>This personal information might include email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, names, mailing addresses, and third-party tracking cookies.\nIf any of this personal information matches users in the ad network's database, then ads can be targeted towards those users, or that information can be used for marketing attribution to determine when a campaign should take credit for a sale.</p>\n<p>When you share your customer's personal information, make sure that you do so with a marketing partner that you trust.\nIt's important to tell your customers how you share data, and to decide what type of data, or how much data, you want to track and share.\nMake sure that your privacy policy is up to date to provide this information to your customers.</p>\n<p>Some partners or channels, such as Facebook, let you to customize the type and amount of data you track and share.</p>\nTracking European customers and GDPR compliance\n<p>Under the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), European customers visiting your online store must give consent before they can be tracked.\nThe most common way of tracking customers to your online store is using browser cookies.\nThese browser cookies are referred to as non-essential cookies and must be limited in use until consent is given by the customer.</p>\nLimit tracking for visitors from Europe\n<p>To limit the tracking of European customers visiting your online store, as determined by their IP address, you can enable <strong>Limit tracking for customers in Europe</strong> in your Shopify store settings.\nWhen enabled, this feature limits Shopify\u2019s tracking of online store customers and notifies any third-party apps that you have installed in your store to limit their own tracking.</p>\nSteps: <ol>\n<li>\n<p>In your Shopify admin, click <strong>Online Store</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Customer privacy</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Limit tracking for customers in Europe</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol> Caution <p>\nLimiting non-essential cookie tracking impacts the accuracy of your online store analytics, marketing attribution, and your ability to do retargeting.</p> How Shopify limits tracking\n<p>Shopify limits customer tracking by downgrading its own non-essential cookies, outlined in our Cookie Policy, to session cookies.\nSession cookies are generally deleted when the customer closes their browser.\nIf a customer consents to tracking, then the non-essential cookies are upgraded to persistent cookies, which are not deleted when the customer closes their browser.</p>\nHow Shopify limits third-party tracking\n<p>Because Shopify can\u2019t control if a third-party app or script tracks a customer, we provide third parties with a consent tracking API for them to integrate with.\nThe consent tracking API tells the third party if a customer has provided consent to be tracked.\nIf <strong>Limit tracking for customers in Europe</strong> is not enabled, then third parties using the consent tracking API are told that a European customer can be tracked unless consent is explicitly revoked.</p>\n<p>Review the terms of service and privacy policies of third-party apps and scripts that you\u2019re working with to determine how they are respecting customer consent.</p>\nGetting customer tracking consent\n<p>Gathering customer consent lets you track customers in countries and regions that require consent before tracking.\nThe most common way of gathering this consent is through privacy banners or cookie banners.\nThese banners often appear at the bottom of websites and prompt the user with the option to accept non-essential cookies for analytics and marketing.</p>\n<p>If you're looking to implement your own privacy banner, or use a third-party cookie banner, then verify that the banner uses Shopify\u2019s consent tracking API for reading and collecting the customer\u2019s consent.\nWithout the consent tracking API, Shopify non-essential cookies will continue to be limited, which affects your online store's analytics and marketing performance.</p>\nThird-party sale of California customer data and CCPA compliance\n<p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), customers in California should be able to opt-out of the sale of their data.\nIf you don't provide these customers with an option to opt-out, then they should be automatically exempt from the sale of their data.\nBefore deciding if this is something you should be doing, you should review the CCPA thresholds and talk to your lawyer to determine if your business is affected by this regulation.</p>\nLimit the third-party sale of your California customers\u2019 data\n<p>To limit the third-party sale of California customers\u2019 data, you can enable <strong>Limit the third-party sale of your California customers\u2019 data</strong> in your Shopify store settings.\nWhen enabled, this feature informs third parties that use the consent tracking API to not sell your California customers\u2019 data if they are doing so.</p>\nSteps: <ol>\n<li>\n<p>In your Shopify admin, click <strong>Online Store</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt.\n<strong>Customer privacy</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Click <strong>Limit the third-party sale of your California customers\u2019 data</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When deciding to share your customer\u2019s data with third parties note that Shopify can't control how the data is used by third parties, and can only inform them how data should be handled.\nYou should review the privacy policies of third-party apps and scripts that you\u2019re working with and consult your lawyer.</p>\n<p>Shopify never sells your data as the term is defined by the CCPA.\nFor more information, refer to <em>Shopify's position on sale of personal information</em>.</p> Caution <p>\nLimiting the third-party sale of customer data can impact your ability to retarget your customers using third-party marketing platforms.</p> Opting out of targeted ads\n<p>Anyone can opt-out of targeted ads served by specific third-party vendors by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Opt-Out page or the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Opt-Out page.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-04-05 08:56:55.437157", "updated_at":
