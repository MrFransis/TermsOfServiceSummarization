accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS.\nThe failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.\nMedium shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Medium\u2019s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.\nIf any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to

gathering and dissemination practices with respect to the Site and Services.</p>\n<p>We have also created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy.\nWe recognize that when you provide us with information about yourself that you trust us to act in a responsible manner with that information, and we\u2019re committed to making sure we earn that trust.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Consent</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By using the Service or submitting personal information through the Service, you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information according to this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>We process the personal information we obtain on our servers in the United States of America and in other countries.\nIn some cases, we process personal information on a server outside your own country.\nLaws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>\n<p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, \"Affiliates\"), we may in the future.\nWe may share some or all of your personal

that such transfers may occur.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What information do we collect from users and how is it used?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you, and how we use and maintain that information:</p>\n<p>Information collected online can generally be categorized as either non-personal information or personally identifiable information.\nNon-personal information is information that cannot by itself be traced back to a specific individual.\nFor example, we know how many calls or queries we receive each day but we do not know the names and email addresses of the persons submitting the queries.\nPersonally identifiable information is information you provide to us that is uniquely associated with you, such as your name or email address.</p>\n<p>We do not associate any non-personal information we collect from you, including your search queries and IP address, with the personally identifiable information that you may submit to us.\nFor this reason, we do not consider your IP address to be personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>Registration</p>\n<p>Before you can utilize certain Services that we offer on the Site or otherwise, we may ask that you register with Embedly and provide us with your email address, a password, your first and last name and other contact information and personal details.\nWe request this information for identification purposes, to communicate with you regarding your account, and to facilitate the functioning of certain Services.\nWe may keep this information indefinitely, unless you request for account deletion.</p>\n<p>Correspondence</p>\n<p>If you correspond with us via email, we may gather in a file specific to you the information that you submit.\nWe may keep this information indefinitely unless you request for account deletion.</p>\n<p>URL and IP address</p>\n<p>Like many other services, Medium collects information about users\u2019 utilization and navigation of our Site and use of Services.\nThis information helps us to design our Site and Services to better suit our users\u2019 needs.\nFor example, our Site or Services will track the URL that you visited before you came to our Site or used our Services, the URL to which you next go, your Internet Protocol (IP) address and any URLs to which you link using the Services.\nWe use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Site or Services.\nYour IP address also is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.</p>\n<p>Information Collected With Cookies</p>\n<p>Like most major websites and services, we may use cookies on certain pages of our Site or pages using our Services.\nCookies make using the Internet easier by, among other things, saving your preferences for you.\nFor example, a cookie lets a Site or Services remember that you\u2019ve registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our Site or Services, and which allows you to enter your registration information less frequently while visiting our Site or using our Services.\nWe may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests.\nOur cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Site or Services to personally identifying information that you previously submitted, such as calling you by name when you return to our Site or use our
