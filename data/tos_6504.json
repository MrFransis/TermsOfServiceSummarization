alternatives, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution.\nWe will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.\nOther than those matters listed in Section 7.2, you and MedicalAlertSystems agree to seek resolution of the dispute only through arbitration of that dispute in accordance with the terms of this Section 7, and not litigate any dispute in court.\nArbitration means that the dispute will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator

SPECIFICALLY AGREE TO DO SO IN WRITING FOLLOWING INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATION.\n<br>\n<br>\n7.5\t<u>Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Arbitrator.</u> If you or MedicalAlertSystems elect to resolve your dispute through arbitration, the party initiating the arbitration proceeding may initiate it with the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), www.adr.org, or JAMS www.jamsadr.com.\nThe terms of this Section 7 govern in the event they conflict with the rules of the arbitration organization selected by the parties.\n<br>\n<br> 7.6\t<u>Arbitration Procedures.</u> Because the Service concerns interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all disputes.\nHowever, applicable federal or state law may also apply to the substance of any disputes.\nFor claims of less than $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (\u201cSupplementary Procedures\u201d) shall apply including the schedule of arbitration fees set forth in Section C-8 of the Supplementary Procedures.\nfor claims over $75,000, the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules and relevant fee schedules for non-class action proceedings shall apply.\nThe AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.\nFurther, if your claims do not exceed $75,000 and you provided notice to and negotiated in good faith with MedicalAlertSystems as described above, if the arbitrator finds that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator, in addition to any rights to recover the same under controlling state or federal law afforded to MedicalAlertSystems or you.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nSuch award will be binding and final, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n<br>\n<br> 7.7\t<u>Location of Arbitration.</u> You or MedicalAlertSystems may initiate arbitration in either Orange County, California or the county in which you reside.\nIn the event that you select the county of your residence, MedicalAlertSystems may transfer the arbitration to Orange County, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the change in location as determined by the arbitrator\n<br>\n<br> 7.8\t<u>Severability.</u> If any clause within this Section 7 (other than the Class Action Waiver clause of Section 7.4) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Section 7, and the remainder of this Section 7 will be given full force and effect.\nIf the Class Action Waiver (Section 7.4) clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Section 7 will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court and you and MedicalAlertSystems each agree to waive in that instance, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.\n<br>\n<br>\n7.9\t<u>Continuation.</u> .\nThis Section 7 shall survive any termination of the Terms\n<br>\n<br> 8.\nGeneral Provisions\n<br>\n8.1\t<u>Updates to the Terms and Privacy Policy:</u>\n<br>\n<br>\n8.1.1\tMedicalAlertSystems reserves the right, at our

provision, \u201cwriting\u201d does not include an e-mail message and a signature does not include an electronic signature.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.1.3\tIf at any point you do not agree to any portion of the

immediately terminate, and you must immediately stop using the Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.1.4\tTo the extent the Terms or Privacy Policy conflict with any other MedicalAlertSystems terms, policy, rules or codes of conduct, the terms contained in these Terms and in the Privacy Policy shall govern.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.2\t<u>Severability.</u> You and MedicalAlertSystems agree that if any portion of these Terms or of the Privacy Policy is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall continue to be in full force and effect.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.3\t<u>Assignment.</u> MedicalAlertSystems may assign or delegate these Terms and/or the Privacy Policy, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time without your consent.\nYou may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms or the Privacy Policy without MedicalAlertSystems\u2019 prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is ineffective.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.4\t<u>Supplemental Policies.</u> MedicalAlertSystems may publish

established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and us with respect to the Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.6\t<u>No Waiver.\n</u>The failure of MedicalAlertSystems to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms or the Privacy Policy or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of MedicalAlertSystems\u2019 right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.\nThe express waiver by MedicalAlertSystems of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms or the Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.\nExcept as expressly and specifically set forth in these Terms, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by MedicalAlertSystems shall be deemed a modification of these Terms nor legally binding, unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of MedicalAlertSystems.\n<br>\n<br>\n8.7\t<u>Notices.</u> We may notify you via postings on www.\nmedicalalertsystems.us, and via

other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you.\nYou irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Service, exploitation of any advertising or other materials issued in connection therewith, or exploitation of the
