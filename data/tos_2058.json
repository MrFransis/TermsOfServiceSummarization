5, 2020\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>UPDATE:</strong>\nUpdates have been made to the International transfers section of\nthe Data Processing Addendum to more clearly describe where data uploaded by or on behalf of Customers to\nBackblaze are stored, and to also address the recent invalidation of Privacy Shield.\n<br>\nThis document is a \u201cData Processing Agreement\u201d (\u201cDPA\u201d) as required for certain customers under Article\n28 of the \u201cGeneral Data Protection Regulation\u201d (EU) 2016/679 (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\n<br>\n<br>\nThis DPA is an addendum to, and is referenced by the Backblaze Terms of\nService found on the Backblaze\nweb site.\nIn case of a conflict between the terms of the DPA and the Backblaze Terms of Service, the DPA\nwill take precedence.\n<br>\n<br>\nThis DPA is intended to be binding on Backblaze with regard to each of its customers whose processing of\nfiles stored with Backblaze is subject to the GDPR (\u201cCustomers\u201d).\nIt governs the processing by Backblaze\nof personal data, as defined by the GDPR, contained in files that a customer stores with Backblaze\n(\u201cFiles\u201d).\n<br>\n<br>\nAs the GDPR evolves and best practices are refined, Backblaze reserves the right to update this DPA at\nany time.\nIf there is something we view as a material change, we will notify our customers via email 30\ndays in advance of the change and will offer our customers the right to terminate the services before\nthe change takes effect.\n<br>\n<br>\nSubject-matter and nature of the processing\nBackblaze offers two services: a computer backup service, with which a customer can backup its files to\nour servers automatically, and a cloud storage service, with which the customer can upload files to our\nservers (together the \u201cServices\u201d).\nTo the extent that these files are uploaded by or on behalf of a\nCustomer and they contain personal data as defined in the GDPR, Backblaze processes this data as a\nprocessor, as defined in the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\nType of personal data and categories of data subjects\nThe types of personal data and categories of data subjects processed in the context of Backblaze\u2019s\nServices depend on the content of files uploaded to servers by or on behalf of its Customers.\n<br>\n<br>\nPurpose\nBackblaze will only process the Files for the performance of the Service to the Customer, on the\ndocumented instructions from the Customer, and to comply with laws to which Backblaze is subject.\nWhere\nBackblaze processes Files to comply with a legal requirement, it shall inform the Customer which\nuploaded the data thereof before processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important\ngrounds of public interest.\n<br>\n<br>\nDuration\nBackblaze processes any Files for the duration it provides the Services to the customer.\nWhen the\nCustomer cancels their Backblaze subscription and deletes their Backblaze account, Backblaze will delete\nthe files stored for the period set out in the Backblaze Terms of Service.\n<br>\n<br>\nInternational transfers\nFor Backblaze Customers who establish their Backblaze account in the EU (EU-Central region), the Files\nuploaded by or on behalf of Customers to Backblaze are stored in the EU and are not transferred outside\nof the EU unless directed by the Backblaze Customer.\nBy making such a request, the Customer is giving\nBackblaze permission to perform the transfer of the requested Files, including the transfer of the\nrequested Files to the United States as applicable.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor Backblaze Customers who establish their Backblaze account in the US (US-West region), the Backblaze\nservers where your uploaded Files will reside is located in the United States.\nThis means a Customer with\na US-based Backblaze account, who resides in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d) and uses Backblaze\u2019s\nServices, will have their Files transferred outside of the EEA and stored in the United States.\nBy accepting\nBackblaze\u2019s Terms of Service and/or by using Backblaze\u2019s services, a Customer is considered to have given instructions to do so when using Backblaze\u2019s Services.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn light of the recent ruling issued by the Court of Justice of the European Union on the invalidation of the\nEU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, and the recent opinion provided by the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner\n(FDPIC) of Switzerland on the inadequacy of the Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework, we are no longer relying on\nthese frameworks when transferring personal information from the EEA and Switzerland to the United States.\nWe continue to comply with applicable EU data transfer requirements, including adherence to no less than the\nprinciples of the EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Frameworks.\nWe are closely monitoring development of\ninternational data-transfer mechanisms under the GDPR and will update our policies accordingly.\nAdditional information\ncan be found in the International Data Transfer section of the Backblaze Privacy Notice.\n<br>\n<br>\nConfidentiality\nBackblaze ensures that persons authorized to process the Files have committed themselves to\nconfidentiality.\n<br>\n<br>\nSecurity\nBackblaze with regard to Files shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to\nensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, the costs\nof implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of\nvarying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.\n<br>\n<br>\nSubprocessors\nThe Customer, by accepting Backblaze\u2019s Terms of Service and/or by using Backblaze\u2019s Services, authorizes\nBackblaze to engage processors for processing the Files of Customers.\nIf Backblaze engages other\nprocessors, Backblaze shall inform the customer, thereby giving the Customer the opportunity to object\nto such changes.\nWhen Backblaze engages a processor, it shall impose data protection obligations which\nare no less onerous as those set out in this DPA on that other processor by way of a contract or other\nlegal act, in particular providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and\norganizational measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR.\nWhere that other processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, Backblaze remains fully\nliable to the Customer for the performance of that other processor's obligations, but only to the extent\nthat Backblaze can be held liable under its Terms of Service.\nA list of the subprocessors that Backblaze\nengages to process Files is available upon request to privacy@backblaze.com.\n<br>\n<br>\nAssistance with exercise of rights\nAt the request of a Customer, Backblaze shall assist it by appropriate technical and organizational\nmeasures, taking into account the nature of the processing and insofar as this is possible, for the\nfulfilment of the Customer\u2019s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the data subject's rights\nlaid down in Chapter III of the GDPR.\n<br>\n<br>\nAssistance with security, data breaches and DPA\nBackblaze shall assist the Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32\nto 36 of the GDPR, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to\nBackblaze.\nIn the unlikely event of a data breach, as defined in the GDPR, Backblaze will without undue\ndelay send its affected customers a notification email, and provide at its discretion, updates through\nother communications channels.\nThis notification will describe the nature of the data breach, including\nwhere possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned, the categories and\napproximate number of personal data records concerned, the contact point where more information can be\nobtained, the likely consequences of the personal data breach, and the measures taken or proposed to be\ntaken by Backblaze to address the data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its\npossible adverse effects.\nA \u201cdata breach\u201d does not include a Backblaze account being accessed via valid\ncredentials unless those credentials were exposed through some action or fault of Backblaze or one of\nits sub-processors.\n<br>\n<br>\nDeletion and return of Files\nBackblaze shall, at the choice of the Customer, delete or return all the Files to the Customer after the\nend of the provision of the Services subject to any fee applicable at that time, and delete existing\ncopies within the period set out under \u201cDuration,\u201d unless applicable law requires storage of such data.\nSubject to any fee applicable at the time, Customers may request copies (i.e., return) of their Files\nwithin their Backblaze account prior to cancelling their Services.\n<br>\n<br>\nInformation\nBackblaze shall at the request of a Customer make available to it all information reasonably necessary\nto demonstrate compliance with the obligations under this DPA, including a copy of the most recent\nreport on such compliance performed at the request of Backblaze by an external auditor, if available,\nand only if the Customer agrees to keep such information confidential under a non-disclosure agreement\nprovided by Backblaze.\nBackblaze shall immediately inform the Customer if, in its opinion, an\ninstruction infringes the GDPR data protection provisions applicable to the Customer and/or Backblaze.\n<br>\n<br>\nFor further information on our compliance with the GDPR, please visit our knowledge base at help.backblaze.com\nor
