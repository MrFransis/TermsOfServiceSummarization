Simply <p>We collect IP address and cookie information from users who interact with the site.\nThis includes listening to or downloading content.</p>\n<p>When creating an account, we also store the email address you provide to us.</p>\n<p>We do not provide this information to ANYONE outside of our organization without a legal request.</p>\n<p>You may update your account information at any time.</p>\n<p>You may contact us to disable your account.\nHowever, we may retain certain information used to help fight piracy.</p> Our Commitment to Privacy <p>Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners.\nThe Policy is designed to assist you in

statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p> What Information Do We Collect? <p>When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nPersonal Information You Choose to Provide</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Credit Card Information</p>\n<p>If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services.\nFor example, you may need to provide the following information:</p>\n<p>Name<br> Mailing address<br> E-mail address<br> Credit card number<br> Home and business phone number<br> E-mail Information</p>\n<p>In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose to correspond further with us through e-mail, we may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our responses.\nWe provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</p>\n<p>If you choose to register with us, we also store the information that you provide to us to aid in accessing and servicing your account.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when interacting with our website, we may store information to assist in statistical reporting.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.\nWeb Site Use Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Similar to other Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called \"cookies\" (see explanation below, \"What Are Cookies?\") and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used.\nInformation gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site.\nThis information is collected on an aggregate basis.\nNone of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.\nLocation Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you access DatPiff through a mobile application, we may collect Geolocation information from you, including proximity to merchants.</p> How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us? <p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services to our customers and prospective customers.\nOccasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.\nThe lists used to send you product and service offers are developed and managed under our traditional standards designed to safeguard the security and privacy of our customers' personal information.\nAs a customer, you will be given the opportunity, at least once annually, to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers.</p> What Are Cookies? <p>Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site.\nThey are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive.\nCookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user's transactions on related Web pages.\nThis makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet.\nCookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized.</p> How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? <p>We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users' browsing activities in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers.\nThis information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.</p>\n<p>Cookies help us collect important business and technical statistics.\nThe information in the cookies lets us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they move from one page to another.\nWeb server logs allow us to count how many people visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity.\nWe do not use these technologies to capture your individual e-mail address or any personally identifying information about you although they do permit us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses to you.</p>\n<p>We also allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site.\nThese companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.\nThese companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.\nTo learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.</p> Sharing Information with Affiliates <p>From time to time you may notice offers from outside companies advertised on our Web site.\nWe take measures to select product or service providers that are responsible and afford privacy protections to their customers.\nHowever, we cannot make any representations about the practices and policies of these companies.</p>\n<p>We may share your geolocation data with affiliates when using our mobile applications.</p> Sharing Information with Strategic Partners <p>We may enter into strategic marketing alliances or partnerships with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and e-mail for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you.\nIn connection with strategic marketing alliances or partnerships, we will retain all ownership rights to the information, and we will not share information regarding your social security number or other personal financial data that we may have.</p>\n<p>We will make every effort to notify users when an alliance or partnership would result in the sharing of their information.</p> Notice of New Services and Changes <p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.\nAs our client, you will be given the opportunity to notify us of your desire not to receive these offers by clicking on a response box when you receive such an offer, updating your mailing preferences in your account, or by sending us an e-mail request from our contact page.\n</p> How Do We Secure Information Transmissions? <p>When you send confidential personal credit card information to our processors like PayPal and Google, from our Web site, a secure server software which they have licensed encrypts all information you input before it is sent to them.\nThe information is scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches their Web site.</p>\n<p>Other e-mail that you may send to us may not be secure unless we advise you that security measures will be in place prior to your transmitting the information.\nFor that reason, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as email or account passwords to us through an unsecured e-mail.</p> How Do We Protect Your Information? <p>\n<strong>Information Security.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We utilize encryption/security software to safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we collect from unauthorized access or disclosure and accidental loss, alteration or destruction.\nAll password information stored with us is encoded and not stored in plaintext.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Employee Access, Training and Expectations.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information.\nIn general, our business practices limit employee access to confidential information, and limit the use and disclosure of such information to authorized persons,

information to our affiliates or reputable third parties, but this information will not include personally identifying data, except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p> What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information? <p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p> What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site? <p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein.\nOften links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</p>\n<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.\nYour browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link to our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies.\nPlease read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p> Your Consent <p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and
