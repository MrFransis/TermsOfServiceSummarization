on:&nbsp;May 18, 2018 <p>\n<b>Corel Corporation <br> Cookie and Tracking Tool Notice</b>\n</p>\n<br>\n<p> This information supplements the Corel Privacy Statement.\n</p>\n<br> Information Gathering Tools <p>Corel Corporation (\"Corel\", \"us\", and \"we\") implements a number of industry standard information-gathering tools, such as cookies, LocalStorage, and web beacons, to collect information about your use and interaction with our websites (\"Interaction Information\").\nAs described more fully below, we and our partners use these tools to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users\u2019 movements around our websites, serve targeted advertisements, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nThis notice describes the types of Interaction Information collected our websites and how we may use it.\n</p> Cookies <p>Corel uses cookies on our websites for a variety of useful purposes.\nCookies automatically collect Interaction Information from a visitor to a website and transfer this information to the visitor\u2019s computer or device.\nWe use cookies to analyze web traffic, adapt services, content, and advertisements, to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and to promote the confidence in and security of our websites.\nWe also use cookies to distinguish one user from another and, in conjunction with the log files from our web server, and to calculate the total number of visitors to our websites.\nThis Interaction Information data helps us to obtain the feedback required for constantly improving our websites and to better serve all users.\n</p>\n<p> Because cookies only recognize information related to your computer or device, like your web browser type and version and IP address, we cannot personally identify you from the cookies we collect unless you also choose to identify yourself to us, such as by responding to an ad or promotional offer, purchasing our software, or filling out a web form (such as a \"Sign Up\" form to join our mailing list) or have otherwise previously identified yourself to Corel, you remain anonymous to us.\n</p>\n<p> Corel uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.\nSession cookies exist only for the duration of a single visit to a website.\nThey disappear from your computer or device when you close your browser or turn off your computer.\nPersistent cookies stay on your computer or device after you close your browser or turn off your computer or device.\nLocalStorage functions essentially like a persistent cookie, with slightly greater storage capacity.\nBecause cookies are stored on your own computer or device, you are always free to set your browser to decline them and you can delete them from your device.\nHowever, if you do so, you may find that some web pages do not work smoothly or that your ability to use certain features or functions of our websites may be limited.\n</p>\n<p> The table below describes the different types of cookies used by Corel on its websites and your options for managing your devices\u2019 cookie settings: </p> Type of Cookie Description Managing Settings Required cookie Required cookies enable you to navigate Corel\u2019s websites and use its features, such as enabling single sign-on and Corel\u2019s YourAccount functionality.\n<br> If you have chosen to identify yourself to Corel, we may place on your browser cookies containing an encrypted, unique identifier, which allows us to identify you when you are logged into our website and to process your online transactions and requests.\nBecause required cookies are essential to operate Corel\u2019s websites, you cannot opt out of these cookies.\nFunctionality cookie Functionality cookies enable our websites to remember information you have entered or selections you have made (such as your email or your country) and provide enhanced, more personal features.\n<br> Functionality cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and perform, to enhance and customize your interactions with the Company, and to help us provide you with more relevant messages, including marketing communications.\nThese cookies collect information about how visitors use our websites, including which pages visitors go to most often and if they receive error messages from certain pages.\n<br> Corel may use its own technology or third parties to analyze trends, administer our websites, track users\u2019 movements around our websites, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nWe also use these providers for re-targeting: we and our service providers gather the information about your activities on website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.\n<br> Corel and our third-party partners may also utilize HTML5 local storage or flash cookies for these purposes.\nFlash cookies and HTML5 local storage are different from browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and means of storage of data.\nWe also use flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our website to personalize your visit.\nTo learn more about how to control cookies using your browser settings click here.\n<br>\n<br> To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for flash cookies click

track the performance of these ads.&nbsp.\nThese cookies remember information such as which browsers have visited our websites.\nThe information provided to third parties does not include personal information, but this information may be re-associated with personal information after Corel receives it.\n<br> Corel also uses third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons (see below) on our websites, from emails, and on third-party websites.&nbsp;Ad networks follow your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services by collecting Interaction Information through automated means, including through the use of cookies.\nThese technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a computer, smartphone, or tablet.\nThird parties use this information to provide advertisements about products and services tailored to your interests.\nYou may see these advertisements on other websites or mobile apps on any of your devices.&nbsp;This process also helps us manage and track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nThe third parties Corel partners with to provide certain features on our websites or to display advertising based upon your browsing activity use flash cookies to collect and store information.&nbsp.\nFlash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of data, type of data, and method of storing data.\nWe use Google AdWords &amp.\nGoogle Remarketing-related cookies to allow users who have already visited our Sites and are interested in our Products to be addressed again through targeted advertising on the pages of the Google partner network.\nYou can disable Google's use of cookies for these purposes by visiting https://www.google.com/settings/ads.\nBoth services are subject to the Google privacy policy available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy.\n<br> We use Bing Ads cookies, which enable

HTML5 local storage.\nGoogle Analytics and Google Tag Manager <p>On our websites, we use Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, which uses cookies about your use of our websites that is generally sent to and stored on a Google server in the USA.\nWithin the EU, your IP address will be shortened by Google on our websites, before being sent to Google\u2019s servers.\nFor this purpose, we have implemented the code \"gat._anonymizeIp();\" in order to guarantee an anonymized collection of IP addresses.\nYou can prevent the collection of the data generated by the cookie related to your use of our websites by Google, as well as the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.\nFor more information on Google\u2019s terms of use and data protection, visit https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html and https://privacy.google.com/#.\n</p> Web Beacons <p>Corel uses web beacons alone or with cookies to gather information about how our customers and visitors use our websites and interact with emails from us.\nWeb beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular website tied to the web beacon, and a description of a website tied to the web beacon.\nFor example, Corel may place web beacons in marketing emails so that we are notified when you click on a link in the email that directs you to one of our websites.\nWeb beacons help Corel to operate and improve the content of our websites and email communications.\n</p> Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data <p>Like most websites, we gather Interaction Information automatically to analyze cumulative trends and to administer our websites.\nThis information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage.\nDue to internet communications standards, when you visit or use our websites, we automatically receive the URL of the website you came from and the website you go to when you leave our website.\nThis information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve our websites, and to track and aggregate non-personal information.\nFor example, Salesforce uses IP addresses to monitor the regions our customers and visitors are located in when they visit our websites.\n</p>\n<br> ", "created_at": "2021-05-25 16:49:16.892648", "updated_at": "2021-05-25 16:49:31.714178"}, {"id": 6340, "name": " Privacy Statement ", "url":
