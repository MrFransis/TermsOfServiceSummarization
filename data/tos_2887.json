Trafficking\n&nbsp.\n<p>\n<b>California Transparency in Supply Chain Disclosure Statement</b>\n</p>\n<p>We actively pursue growth through leadership in environmental, socially responsible and ethical business practices.\nCorporate social responsibility is core to our operating philosophy, and that commitment drives our dedication to People, Products, Community and the Planet.\nThat commitment extends to our supply chain, and our suppliers play a critical role in ensuring that we manage our business in a responsible manner.</p>\n<p>In 2010, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (also referred to as SB 657) was signed into law, and statutes enacted under the Act went into effect on January 1, 2012.\nThe Act requires disclosure of particular efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking.</p>\n<p>We are committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner and expect our suppliers to conduct themselves in the same manner.\nWe have implemented various policies and procedures in our efforts to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains.\nThis disclosure will describe some of those efforts.</p>\n<p>With the assistance of a third-party consultant, we survey our merchandise supply chains in order to evaluate and to address risks of slavery and human trafficking inherent in those activities.\nThis survey forms the basis for additional anti-slavery, anti-human trafficking efforts, including targeted supplier requirements and third-party audits.</p>\n<p>We have long used contractual provisions prohibiting the use of involuntary labor and child labor, and requiring compliance with applicable labor and employment laws, in the production of merchandise that we sell.\nWe have a stringent Supplier Code of Conduct (\u201cCode\u201d) that sets out specific standards and requirements for any supplier we do business with which includes provisions to protect workers.\nAmong other things, the Code requires our suppliers to allow factory inspections for contractual compliance, as well as for compliance with laws and regulations dealing with child or forced labor and unsafe working conditions.</p>\n<p>In our efforts to confirm compliance with such contractual provisions and to document compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, each of our merchandise suppliers has been asked to certify that the materials incorporated into the merchandise they supply complies with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.\nSuppliers are also required to ensure that any subcontractor used in the manufacturing or distribution of any merchandise to us complies with the same standards.</p>\n<p>Any supplier that is not able to provide the foregoing certification will be required, as a condition to continuing to supply merchandise to us, to submit an action plan to achieve such certification within a reasonable period of time.\nThose suppliers that fail to comply will be subject to increasing levels of discipline, up to and including termination of their relationships.</p>\n<p>In an effort to verify supplier responses and to help us identify areas of increased risk of slavery and human trafficking, we are requiring that our suppliers complete a survey identifying measures they have taken, or intend to take, to prevent these abuses.</p>\n<p>We have reviewed the risks of slavery and human trafficking presented by various parts of our supply chain and has inspected the factory premises of the suppliers of our own-branded merchandise for evidence of non-compliance with slavery and human trafficking laws.\nIn addition, we have, on a risk-based basis, engaged third-party auditors to review compliance of certain suppliers with international social accountability standards.</p>\n<p>Responsible employees have been advised of our prohibitions against the use of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains.\nAdditionally, we have implemented training requirements for employees with sourcing responsibilities.</p>\n<p>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-03-28 17:10:39.550315", "updated_at": "2021-03-28 17:10:47.618252"}, {"id": 4453, "name": "Digital

have Collected directly from you and are maintaining.&nbsp.\nOur retention rights include, without limitation, to complete transactions and provide services you have requested or that are reasonably anticipated, for security purposes, for legitimate internal business purposes, including maintaining business records, to comply with law, to exercise or defend legal claims, and to cooperate with law enforcement.\nNote also that we are not required to delete your PI that we did not Collect directly from you.\nTo make a request, click here, or call us at (877) 251-6559 (toll free).\nYou will be

delete, we will explain the basis for the retention and will only retain it for such purpose and for so long as the retention purpose continues to exist.</p>\n<p>Rather than exercising a deletion request, you may alternatively exercise more limited control of your PI by instead opting out of e-mail marketing communications by following the unsubscribe instructions on the footer of those emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(c) \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d</p>\n<p>While California law also allows for California residents to opt out of the sale of their PI, we do not believe

to opt-out of future Sales here or call us at (877) 251-6559 (toll free).&nbsp.\nAlthough we believe that Third Party cookies we permit to be associated with our online Services restrict their data processing to what is permitted by Service Providers under the CCPA as to California Consumers, and thus do not result in a Sale of PI by us, to learn more about cookie choices here<b>.</b>\n</p>\n<p>(d) Verification Process</p>\n<p>After you (or a qualified agent which you duly authorize) submits a request to know or delete your PI, we are required to Verify your request to ensure that the request is not fraudulent (\u201cVerifiable Consumer Request\u201d)\u201d.\nThus, upon receiving your request we will take measures to verify that the request is legitimate.\nThese verification efforts may require additional information from you which may include information you have provided us in the past.\nFor instance, if you have previously provided your name to us, we may ask you for other information (e.g., last four digits of your credit card, email address, phone number, or transaction history) so that we can match the new information you provide with the information we have.\nWe may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.\nIf through reasonable efforts we are unable to verify your request to the appropriate degree of certainty, we will notify you.</p>\n<p>We will use PI provided in a Verifiable Consumer Request only to verify your identity or your authority to make the request and to track and document request responses, unless you also gave it to us for another purpose.</p>\n<p>(e) Agent Requests</p>\n<p>Note you can authorize an agent to exercise any of these California privacy rights on your behalf, subject to the agent request requirements of the CCPA.\nNote that we will take additional measures to verify the legal authority of your agent.\nAgents should contact us here.</p>\n<p>(f) Exceptions</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, we may Collect, use and disclose your PI as required or permitted by applicable law and this may override your CCPA rights.\nIn addition, we need not honor any of your requests to the extent that doing so would infringe upon our or any other person or party\u2019s rights or conflict with applicable law.\nFurther, to protect your privacy and security we will not provide you with access to or copies of sensitive PI such as government identification or financial account numbers, passwords or answers to security questions or biometric identifiers.\nprovided, however, that we will inform you if we maintain any such applicable types of PI.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some PI we maintain about Consumers is not sufficiently associated with enough PI about the Consumer for us to be able to verify that it is a particular Consumer\u2019s PI when a Consumer request that requires verification pursuant to the CCPA\u2019s verification standards is made (e.g., clickstream data tied only to a pseudonymous browser ID).&nbsp.\nAs required by the CCPA, we do not include that PI in response to those requests.\nIf we cannot comply fully with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response, unless we are prohibited from doing so by applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to identify Consumer PI that we Collect, process, store, disclose and otherwise use and to respond to your California Consumer rights requests.\nIn some cases, particularly with voluminous and/or typically irrelevant data, we may suggest that you receive the most recent or a summary of your PI and give you the opportunity to elect whether you want the rest or not.\nWe reserve the right to direct you to where you may access and copy responsive PI yourself.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests.\nprovided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if your request is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.\nYou will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.\nAs permitted by the CCPA, we are also not required to search for PI not maintained in a searchable or reasonably accessible format that is used for certain internal purposes only, but we apply this exception we will respond to your request with a description of the categories of PI to which this exception applies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, as explained above, we will reject requests to the extent we are not able to sufficiently verify your identity, or your agent\u2019s authority.\nIf we conclude we have a basis for not fully responding to your request, our response to you will explain the basis for the limitation, unless we are prohibited from doing so by applicable law.</p>\n<p>(g) Financial Incentives and Non-discrimination</p>\n<p>California residents also have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for the exercise of any of the privacy rights conferred by the California Consumer Privacy Act.\nAs of the Effective Date of this CA Statement we did not offer any programs requiring you to limit any of your CCPA rights, or otherwise require you to limit your CCPA rights in connection with charging a different price or rate, or offering a different level or quality of good or service.\nIf we do so, the CCPA requires certain program terms and notices for California Consumer and the material aspects of any such program, and the rights of California participants, will be explained and described in its program terms.\nParticipating in any such programs will be entirely optional.\nWe may add or change programs and/or their terms by posting notice on the program descriptions so check them regularly.</p>\n<p>Although you may participate in all of our loyalty programs on an anonymous basis (e.g., obtaining but not registering a club card) our loyalty programs allow you to provide us PI (e.g., to use your phone number as your account identifier or providing an email address to receive email communications).\nOur loyalty programs provide members with various membership benefits from time-to-time explained at \u201cjust for U,\u201d \u201cMonopoly,\u201d and Gas Rewards/ Grocery Rewards / Club Card.&nbsp.\nWhile membership is optional (you must opt-in and you can terminate at any time, as explained in the program descriptions and terms available by using the links in the prior sentence or by simply calling customer service at 877-723-3929, and you can remain in the program and still opt-out of our promotional emails and exercise your CCPA rights while electing to remain in the program and receive all of its benefits, the collection of PI for account credentials and communications, and to monitor program-related activity and otherwise operate the programs, could be characterized as a \u201cfinancial incentive\u201d under the CCPA given that we provide member-only benefits and collect PI from some, but not all members, to help facilitate that.&nbsp.\nAccordingly, we provide members notice that we value the PI collected through our loyalty programs as the equivalent of our total program operating expenses (excluding the value of member benefits such as discounts), the details of which we maintain as a trade secret, and we pay these expenses and provide the program benefits to foster a positive relationship with members that is invaluable.&nbsp.\nIn addition, we value the PI collected through our loyalty program, as well as the value of the loyalty program, as the equivalent of the value of member benefits, such as discounts and other savings, received by members, which is also a trade secret.\nHowever, we have determined, to the extent we can track relevant consumer activities, that our customers that use our loyalty programs redeem more manufacture coupons and Albertsons offers than do consumers not participating in our loyalty programs, which we conclude benefits them and us mutually.&nbsp.\nConsumers should review the benefits description and program terms linked to in this paragraph above, as well as our full Privacy Policy, which applies to the Identifiers, Personal records, Commercial information, Online usage information, Inferences from program data and other PI we may collect in connection with our loyalty programs so that they can make an informed decision on whether to participate.&nbsp.\nAlso, please note that if you make a CCPA deletion request your program PI will be maintained for loyalty program operations, unless you also terminate your applicable loyalty accounts, which you may do at any time by following the instructions in the applicable program terms or calling customer service at 877-723-3929.</p>\n<p>\n</p> ", "created_at": "2021-03-28 19:16:41.421645", "updated_at": "2021-03-28 19:16:51.38529"}, {"id": 4471, "name": "Lucky Market Street Terms Of Use", "url":

California 95352</p>\n<strong>Copyright Counter-Notice:</strong>\n<p>If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) pursuant to a Digital Millennium Copyright Act

dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Sites will be resolved by binding arbitration in the federal judicial district in which you reside in California or Nevada, except to the extent that you have, in any way, violated or threatened to violate any Save Mart intellectual property right.</p>\n<p>Any Site visitor who intends to seek arbitration must first send to Save Mart by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice must be mailed to Save Mart Supermarkets, PO Box 4278 Modesto, California 95352&nbsp.\nAttn: General Counsel/Arbitration Demand.\nThe Notice shall describe the nature and basis of the claim or disputes and the specific relief sought.\nIf we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence arbitration.</p>\n<p>All arbitrations required by these Terms will be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s award is binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law no arbitration brought under, or with respect to, the Sites (including, without limitation, any Save Mart advertisement or disclosure, any email or text message or other communication &nbsp;that Save Mart sends to or has with you, or the

otherwise preside over any form of a representative, private attorney general or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>For arbitration claims you assert against Save Mart in accordance with this section (but not for any arbitration claim against you), Save Mart will pay all of your administrative, hearing, and arbitrator\u2019s fees and costs for the arbitration (but not the fees, expenses, and costs of your lawyers, experts, or witnesses) in excess of any filing fee you would have been required to pay to file the claim as a lawsuit in a state or federal court (whichever is greater) in the judicial district in which you reside in California or Nevada.\n&nbsp;Unless unlawful, Save Mart will pay its, and you will pay your, lawyers\u2019, experts\u2019, and witness fees, expenses, and costs with respect to all claims.\nThe arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.\nSimilarly, an arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case.\nit cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the award itself.\nTo reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by all parties.</p>\n<p>To the extent permitted by law, you will not agree to act as a representative or a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or participate as a member of a class of claimants in any lawsuit against Save Mart in any court, or in arbitration, with respect to any claims relating in any way to the Site (including without limitation Save Mart advertisements and disclosures, email and text messages Save Mart sends to you, or relating to the collection or use of any information about you in connection with the Site), these Terms, or your status as a Site visitor.\nThis section

County, California, USA, (or the nearest such California county if such court is not located Stanislaus County, California) and Company and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts as described herein for injunctive relief purposes.</p>\n<p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nWe also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>\n<strong>Disclaimer:</strong>\n<p>THIS SITE IS PROVIDED BY
