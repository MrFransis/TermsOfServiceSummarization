ASKfm\u201d tab on the&nbsp;Contact Us&nbsp;page.\nOnce received, we will process your request to leave as soon as practicable.\nOnce processed, your profile data will be removed from the Services and your questions to friends will be converted to anonymous questions (in other words, questions you have asked will remain visible but will appear to be from an anonymous user).\nYou will be able to reactivate your account by logging back in for a period of 30 days after your request to leave the Services is processed.\nAt the end of that period, your account will be deleted and all \u201clikes\u201d which you have added to questions will be removed.\nWe will delete your data as soon as reasonably practicable, but in certain cases, limited types of data, including log files and backups, may take up to 90 days to be fully deleted.</p>\n<p>Warning: After you have deactivated your account or left the Services, questions may still appear on the Services, but will be anonymized and no longer associated with you directly (in other words, a question you asked on your friend\u2019s profile will still be visible, but will not include your username).\nPlease note also that even after you remove information from your profile or deactivate your account, copies of such content may still be visible and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or to the extent such information has been shared with, indexed by or cached by search engines.\nSimilarly, if you have given third-party applications or websites (e.g., social networks) access to your personal information, they may keep that information.\nWe cannot control this, nor do we accept any responsibility or liability for this.</p>\n(c) Can you suspend or terminate my account if you want to?\n<p>Yes, we can.\nWe may suspend or terminate a user\u2019s access to the Services or a member\u2019s account for any reason, including if we believe a user has violated these TOU.\nWe also reserve the right to at any time block users from accessing and using the Services by using IP blockers or other technological solutions we deem appropriate.\nIf we have grounds to terminate your access to the Services due to a violation of these TOU (including your breach of the Rules of Conduct), we reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services without notice.\nOtherwise, we will provide you with reasonable notice, if your access to the Services and/or your profile is going to be suspended or terminated.</p>\n(d) What are the effects of termination?\n<p>Upon termination or expiration of your rights to use the Services or any portion thereof, you authorize us to delete any files, programs, data and messages associated with your account for the Services, or applicable portion thereof, without notice to you.</p> 9.\nWhat\u2019s the important legal stuff I need to know?\n9A.\nWe give you a limited licence to use the

infringement depending on the circumstances.</p>\n9B.\nWe make changes to the Services or update it if we choose to\n<p>We reserve the right to change or discontinue any aspect of the Services or all the Services at any time without notice to you.\nUpgrades or updates of the Services may be made available from time to time.\nWe do this to improve the quality of the Services that we provide to you and other users.\nThe software or the software application store that makes the software available for download may include functionality to automatically check for updates or upgrades to the software.\nUnless your device, its settings or computer software does not permit transmission or use of upgrades or updates, you agree that we or the applicable software application store may provide notice to you of the availability of such upgrades or updates and automatically push such upgrade or update to your device or computer from time to time.\nYou may be required to install certain upgrades or updates to the software in order to continue to access or use the Services or portions thereof (including upgrades or updates designed to correct issues with the Services).\nAny updates or upgrades provided to you by us under the TOU shall be considered part of the Services.</p>\n9C.\nWhat if I participate in Surveys or Features/Product Testing\n<p>From time to time, ASKfm may offer you the opportunity to participate in a user survey or feature/product test (\u201cEvaluation\u201d).\nIf you agree to participate in an Evaluation, you agree that ASKfm may collect your ideas, feedback, answers, suggestions, comments, designs and other materials in any medium (collectively \u201cMaterials\u201d).\nYou further agree that ASKfm owns the Materials in perpetuity and exclusively

the Services shall, as between you and ASKfm, at all times be and remain the sole and exclusive property of ASKfm.</p>\n<p>(b) The trademarks, logos, taglines and service marks (collectively, the

is strictly prohibited.\nYou are also advised that ASKfm will enforce its intellectual property rights to the fullest extent of the law.</p>\n9E.\nHow do you handle Copyright Claims?&nbsp.\n<p>It is our policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright or other IP rights infringement, and in appropriate circumstances and at our discretion, to disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of ASKfm and/or others.</p>\n(a) Notice for Claims of Intellectual Property Violations and Agent for Notice.\n<p>This process is for copyright and intellectual property matters only and is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to ASKfm as straightforward as possible, while also providing ASKfm with the necessary information for notice verification.\nIf you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide ASKfm\u2019s Copyright Agent with a written communication containing the following information in English (your \u201cNotice\u201d):</p>\n<p>Note: If you are asserting infringement of an intellectual property right other than copyright, you should specify the intellectual property right at issue.</p>\n<p>1.\nA physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</p>\n<p>2.\nA detailed description sufficient to identify the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple works have been infringed, a representative list of such works on the ASKfm site;</p>\n<p>3.\nA description of the material that you claim is infringing and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate this material on the ASKfm site (as part of this information, you must provide us with the specific URL where the material is located);</p>\n<p>4.\nInformation sufficient for ASKfm to contact you, including your username (if applicable), address, telephone number, and/or email address;</p>\n<p>5.\nA statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agents, or the law;</p>\n<p>6.\nA statement by you, made under penalty of perjury (if you are located in the US) or made truthfully (if you are located elsewhere) that the information in this notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner for the material or that you are authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner\u2019s behalf.</p>\n(b) What happens to my copyright claim notice?\n<p>In some circumstances, in order to notify the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content to which ASKfm has disabled access (or intends to disable access), ASKfm may forward a copy of your notification including your name and contact information to the subscriber or account holder.\nThe individual may choose to file a counter-notification explaining why the content does not infringe an IP right following receipt of our notice.\nWe may also, in our sole discretion, post a notice or a copy of your complaint on our site.\nBy providing us with a complaint, you are consenting to your complaint being forwarded to the subscriber, account holder or host who provided the allegedly infringing content, and/or to our posting a notice or copy of your complaint on our site.</p>\n(c) What if I change my mind or make a false copyright claim?\n<p>After submitting a copyright or other IP right, infringement notification, you may realize that you misidentified content or you might otherwise change your mind.\nASKfm will honour retractions of copyright or other IP claims from the party who originally submitted them.\nIt is important that you do not make false claims.\nSubmitting a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement is a serious matter with legal consequences.\nBefore you report a claim of copyright or other IP right infringement to us, you may wish to reach out to the individual posting the content.\nYou may be able to resolve the issue simply by bringing it to their attention without contacting us at all.\nIf you are unsure whether the content you are reporting is infringing your legal rights, you may wish to seek legal guidance.\nKeep in mind that submitting intentionally misleading reports of infringement may be punishable under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or similar laws in other countries.</p>\n(d) Who is the ASKfm copyright agent for DMCA purposes?\n<p>For the purpose of the DMCA, ASKfm\u2019s Agent for notice of claims of copyright or

browser\u2019s help page.\nIf you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some features of the Services.\nFor more information about our use of cookies, please see our&nbsp;Cookie Policy.\nBy using our Services with your browser set to accept cookies you are consenting to our use of cookies in the manner described above and in our Cookie Policy.</p> 8.\nDo you collect data about me from anyone else, like social networks?\n<p>We may collect, process and store:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your user ID associated with any social media account (such as your Twitter or Facebook account) that you use to sign in to the Services or connect with or use with the Services.\nWhen you sign in to your account or mobile application with your social media account information, or otherwise connect to your social media account with the Services, you consent to our collection, storage, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, of the information that you choose to make available to us through the social media interface.\nThis could include, without limitation, any information that you have made public in connection with your social media account, information that the social media service shares with us, or information that is disclosed as being shared during the sign-in process.\nPlease see your social media provider\u2019s privacy policy for more information about how they share information when you choose to connect your account.\nYou expressly consent to the sharing of your content on your social media networks if you connect your Facebook and/or Twitter accounts to your ASKfm account, for example, the automatic sharing of answers posted.\nYou can change this at any time by opt-out in answer composer.</li>\n<li>We may also obtain information about you if it is contained in user-generated content that other users post to or on our Services.\nFor example, one of your friends could post something about you in a question they ask you, or in an answer they post.</li>\n<li>We may obtain additional information about you from affiliates and may combine that information with information which we collect from or about you and information derived from any other product or service we or our affiliates provide.</li>\n</ul> 9.\nDo you anonymize my data so no-one knows its mine?\n<p>Sometimes we may anonymize and/or de-identify information collected through the Services or via other means, including via the use of third-party web analytic tools so that the information no longer relates to you.\nWhere we have appropriately anonymized and/or de-identified information it no longer constitutes your personal information (also known as personal data).\nAs a result, our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not subject to this Privacy Policy and may be disclosed to others on such basis.</p> 10.\nIf I ask a question anonymously, do you still know who I am?\n<p>The fact that you can send messages without other people knowing who you are is part of what makes ASKfm unique and so much fun.\nIt means that you can ask things that you might be too embarrassed or shy to say if anyone knew it was you.\nPeople may often be more honest when they are anonymous, whether they\u2019re asking a question anonymously, or answering a question where they don\u2019t know who has asked it.\nYou have the ability to decide whether to ask a question anonymously or on a named basis each time you submit a question to another user.\nHowever, this also means that when you receive questions or comments, you may not know who they come from either! Remember, as a Registered User, that even if you ask a question anonymously, our Service will still have a record of the fact that you asked the question (even if we keep this private).\nIf you are a Guest User, we may not know who you are.</p> 11.\nIf I don\u2019t register, do you still collect data on me?\n<p>In certain countries we allow unregistered users to ask questions.\nIf you are not a registered user and ask a question, you must accept our terms of use and privacy policy prior to asking your question.\nWe collect information such as your IP address.\nIn certain countries you may be permitted to receive questions from unregistered users.\nIf you have chosen to allow anonymous questions, you will be able to also receive questions from unregistered users by default, although you always have the option to change this in your settings.\nIf you have chosen to not allow anonymous questions, you will have to edit your settings in order to receive questions from unregistered users, if this feature is available in your country.\nThe ability to ask and receive unregistered questions is not available in all countries.\nAny abuse of the unregistered user feature will result in a ban on such users, entirely at our discretion.\nAs a user, you can also choose to temporarily ban unregistered users, or report to us for a longer term ban to be imposed.\nYou should exercise caution when allowing yourself to receive unregistered questions and immediately report any concerns to us.\nWe may assist the police or other law enforcement agencies with their requests, or produce information in response to legal process where we, in good faith, believe that such disclosure is required by law, or to protect our rights and property, or the safety of individual users or the public, or where otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p> 12.\nHow do I stop receiving anonymous questions or unregistered questions?\n<p>Some people don\u2019t like receiving things from people if they don\u2019t know who they are.\nSo we provide all users with the ability to choose not to receive questions from anonymous users on the \u201cSettings\u201d page on the website and mobile application.</p>\n<p>If you do choose to allow anonymous questions, please know that our intention is that they will foster candid, open conversations.\nHowever, if someone does abuse the option of being anonymous through inappropriate communications that violate our Terms of Use because they know you don\u2019t know who they are, you have the ability to report that user to us so that we may take appropriate action.\nWe have also built-in site moderation techniques to protect you and to prevent users from transmitting harmful content.\nFor more information, see our&nbsp;Terms of Use&nbsp;and our&nbsp;Safety and Security Essentials.</p> 13.\nCan law enforcement get my data from you?\n<p>We may assist the police or other law enforcement agencies with their requests, or produce information in response to legal process where we, in good faith, believe that such disclosure is required by law, or to protect our rights and property, or the safety of individual users or the public, or where otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p> 14.\nWhat do you use my information for?\n<p>We use the information we receive from and about you for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide the Services including any special features;</li>\n<li>To process and respond to your inquiries;</li>\n<li>To send you information about your relationship or transactions with us;</li>\n<li>To contact you if you have filed a complaint or report, or if someone has made any claim or report against you;</li>\n<li>To make suggestions to you and other

or to send you questions of the day;</li>\n<li>To moderate content and to keep the Services safe and secure and address any security issues;</li>\n<li>To generate advertising and promotional materials for our Services;</li>\n<li>To understand and assess the effectiveness of advertisements on the Services;</li>\n<li>To process payment for virtual goods that may be available from time to time;</li>\n<li>To administer sweepstakes and contests;</li>\n<li>To generate and review reports and data about our user base and Service usage patterns;</li>\n<li>To analyze the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Services;</li>\n<li>To improve the content and features of the Services;</li>\n<li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you see on the Services;</li>\n<li>To safeguard ASKfm\u2019s and others\u2019 rights or property;</li>\n<li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, involving potential threats to the physical safety of a person, prevention of fraud, and violations of our Terms of Use.\nand</li>\n<li>To administer and troubleshoot the Services.</li>\n</ul> 15.\nDoes ASKfm share my information with other users?\n15A.\nSharing your profile information\n<p>If you are a Registered User, anyone who uses the Services is able to see your username and any information posted on your profile, including photos.&nbsp;Any questions that you receive in your inbox cannot be seen by anyone else until you reply to them.\nIf you do reply, then the question and your answer will be posted on your profile, where they can be seen by anyone who uses the Services and views your profile.&nbsp;While you have the ability to delete posted questions and answers on your profile at any time by clicking the \u201cx\u201d next to the question/answer, you should be careful to only include information in your profile, including any questions and answers, that you would not mind making public.\nIf a Registered User \u201clikes\u201d a question or answer on your profile, the fact that the Registered User \u201cliked\u201d the content will be automatically visible.</p>\n15B.\nDoes my profile show up in search engine results?\n<p>Your profile information will also be searchable via public search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo).</p>\n15C.\nCan other people see my location?\n<p>Your location data is used for some user features like Shoutouts, to target your questions to people within a geographic range but we do not disclose your exact location to any other user.</p>\n15D.\nHow can I protect myself?\n<p>In general, please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.\nShould you choose to voluntarily disclose information through the Services, such as by submitting a question to another user or by answering a question to be posted on your profile, that information can be viewed publicly and people can copy content that is posted on the Internet.\nIt could also be collected and used by third parties without our or your knowledge, which may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.\nYou should not share personal information that might allow others to contact or locate you or other users, and you should think before you post.</p> 16.\nDoes ASKfm share my information with third parties?\n16A.\nWhen and why we share your information with third parties\n<p>We don\u2019t sell or share any personal information about you with third parties, except as provided in this Privacy Policy.\nWe may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To assist in providing the Services;</li>\n<li>To provide you with services or products that you have requested;</li>\n<li>With companies that perform services on our behalf (including both third parties and our affiliates), such as advertising providers, advertising networks/advertising exchanges, payment processors, providers of technical infrastructure (such as servers) or engineering or other support, order fulfillment companies, moderation companies, technical services and features developers, research and analytical companies, and e-mail service providers;</li>\n<li>With our affiliates for the collective benefit of our affiliates\u2019 businesses and for operational purposes;</li>\n<li>When we believe in good faith that such sharing is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use;</li>\n<li>In order to respond to the claims of violation of the rights of third parties and/or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ASKfm, our employees, Registered and Guest Users, or the public.\nThis may involve the sharing of your information with law enforcement, government agencies, courts, and/or other organizations;</li>\n<li>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets.\nIn such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets;</li>\n<li>We may share your information in any other circumstances where we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to share it by law.</li>\n</ul>\n16B.\nDo you use any other companies to help ASKfm provide the services to me?\n<p>For some elements of the Service we get technical assistance from other companies, and we may need to share your information with them so that we can provide those Services to you.</p>\n<p>We might use third parties to provide technical functionality for some of the Features of the Services (like stickers and multimedia posts).\nWe call those Feature Tools.\nIf you choose to use the Feature Tools, we may collect and store non-personally identifiable anonymous statistical data if you use that feature tool, where such tool is operated by a third party.\nWe do not cooperate with Feature Tool providers that sell or otherwise transfer any of your data to third parties without your consent.\nYou should review the privacy policies of the Feature Tools, and in order that you can do that we provide a list here of the Feature Tool Providers we currently work with.</p>\n<p>Feature Tool Providers List: Kanvas Labs Inc, which has its privacy policy available to view at https://www.getkanvas.com/privacy</p>\n16C.\nDo you use my questions and answers for research?\n<p>We or third parties we use may analyze your questions and answers for research purposes.\nWhen we use a third party to do this, we do not share any personal information with that party, we only provide anonymized questions and answer content and other non-personalised statistical data for analysis purposes.</p>\n16D.\nTell me more about sharing my data for advertising purposes\n<p>\n<strong>(a) Anonymous Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In order to understand our audience better and improve our service, such anonymous information is provided to third parties for their business purposes, including the creation of reports, market research, and trend analysis.\nThis information does not contain information from which users can be identified and we will not provide additional information to such third parties that enable such third parties to identify you.\nNotwithstanding any other provision, we may also engage a third-party partner for the purpose of identifying users and delivering to them interest-based content and advertisements.\nWe may share information about you with our partners such as your name, postal address, e-mail, or other identifier and may do so in non-human readable format to ensure the security of your information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>(b) Sometimes it\u2019s personal data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our partners also may collect information directly from your device, such as your IP address, device ID (which in some countries is considered as personal data) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.\nmay combine our personal and non-personal information about you with information from other sources.\nand may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.\nIf we are sharing ANY data that is considered to be personal data by the appropriate laws of the country in which you live, we will always ask your consent before we use your data in this way (and you can ask us to stop at any time).</p>\n<p>(c) To opt out of third-party cookies, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices and/or https://liveramp.com/opt_out/ and/or https://liveramp.uk/privacy/ if you are in Great Britain.\nTo opt out of the use of your mobile

live in Europe, what does \u201cprofiling\u201d mean and why do you need me to consent to it?\n<p>Profiling means we analyse your information and content (like your interests) so that we can tailor our advertising to you and what you\u2019d like to see.\nSince the law changed in Europe in May 2018, we now need to ask your consent before we profile your information.\nThat\u2019s why, before we use your information in this way, you are asked to tick a box to allow us to profile your information and use it for tailored advertising.</p>\n16F.\nWhat is tailored advertising?\n<p>Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may also use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your use of the Services.\nThis is done in order to help them (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our website and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our website.\nWe also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks/ad exchanges and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, and to access their own cookies or similar technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks, ad exchanges, or any other non-affiliated third parties.\nThose parties that use these technologies may permit you to opt out of ad targeting as described below.\nYou may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser.\nIf you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out Link, European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance, \u201cYour Online Choices\u201d page and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out Link to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.\nTo opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit the Google Ads Settings page.\nPlease note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising.\nIn that case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests.\nAlso, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.\n</p>\n<p>When accessing the Services from a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.\nEach operating system: iOS, Android and Windows Phone provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.\nYou may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt out of tailored in-application advertisements.\nFor any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.</p> 17.\nWhat are online analytics?\n<p>To help us better understand your use of the Services, we may use third-party web analytics on our Services, such as Google Analytics or Flurry.\nThese service providers use the sort of technology that we\u2019ve explained above for data that is automatically collected about your device, for example.\nThe information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate ASKfm users\u2019 use of the Services.\nWe also use Google Analytics as described more below.\nTo prevent Google Analytics from collecting or using your information, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.\nto opt out of Flurry collecting or using your information, go to Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.</p> 18.\nHow long do you keep my information for?\n<p>We keep your information and store it safely as long as you are using the Services.\nAfter you close your account we still keep some or all of your information for up to 9 months.\nIt is important that we retain your data for this short period after cancellation to ensure that we can answer any payment or other account related queries, or provide information to third parties in line with our disclosure provisions outlined in this policy, e.g., assisting police investigations.\nEven after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines.\nWe cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this.\nIf you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.\nWe also keep a record of some of your information like you IP address or e-mail address if you\u2019ve broken the rules and we\u2019ve added you to our block list: this helps to keep everyone safe on the Services.</p> 19.\nImportant notice about our Do Not Track Disclosure\n<p>We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the above links to the NAI \u201cConsumer Opt-out\u201d, DAA opt-out, and Google opt-out.\nHowever, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.</p> 20.\nHow can I update my privacy choices?\n<p>You have a variety of choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your personal information through the Services, including the ability to prevent other users from submitting questions to you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab of the&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;page allows you to: (1) switch off receiving anonymous questions.\nand (2) hide your answers from appearing in the \u201cStream\u201d.</li>\n<li>You can opt out of receiving certain e-mail notifications from us, including e-mails advertising ASKfm products and services, by clicking the \u201cNotifications\u201d tab of the Settings page on the mobile app and through the \u201cPrivacy\u201d tab of the&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;page on the site.</li>\n</ul> 21.\nHow can I block other users?\n<p>You have the ability to add any user to your \u201cblocklist\u201d at any time by clicking on the \u201cblock\u201d button on that user\u2019s profile.\nThis will prevent the user from asking you a question.</p> 22.\nHow does ASKfm protect my information?\n<p>We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access to your information and to maintain data security.\nThese safeguards take into account the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process and store and the current state of technology.\nAlthough we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, the internet and the Services are not 100% secure so we cannot assure you that personal information we collect or store will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.\nWe strongly urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your password) and to log out of your account after use.\nYou should not tell anyone (other than your parents or guardian, if you are a minor) your password.\nIf you lose your password or give it out to someone, your personal information will be at risk.\nIf that happens, you should report it to us immediately by clicking&nbsp;here.\nYou must also change your password immediately via your \u201cSettings\u201d page.\nWe are not responsible for your failure to keep your password secure and failure to do so may breach our&nbsp;Terms of Use.\nWe also strongly recommend that you change your password from time to time.</p> 23.\nI want to deactivate my profile or leave ASKfm\n<p>You also have the right (in certain cases) to modify or delete the personal information we hold about you.\nYou can generally exercise these rights by following the process described in the \u201cDeactivating Your Profile\u201d and \u201cLeaving ASKfm\u201d sections of this Privacy Policy.\nHowever, you can also contact us using the details in Section 28 below, if you wish to modify information that cannot be amended or deleted through the Service.</p>\n23A.\nDeactivating Your Profile\n<p>You can deactivate your profile by signing in to the Services with your password and opting to deactivate your profile.\nThis option is available from your Settings page.\nBy deactivating your account, it will no longer be visible to other users of the Services.\nYour profile information will be retained in case you later decide to restore your account.\nMany members deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to ASKfm.\nYou should ordinarily be able to restore your account and the whole of your profile within 12 months of deactivating it, but we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.</p>\n23B.\nLeaving ASKfm\n<p>Should you choose to leave ASKfm, you may do so by selecting the \u201cI want to leave ASKfm\u201d tab on the&nbsp;Contact Us&nbsp;page.\nOnce received, we will process your request to leave as soon as practicable.\nOnce processed, your profile data will be removed from the Services and your questions to friends will be converted to anonymous questions (in other words, questions you have asked will remain visible but will appear to be from an anonymous user).\nYou will be able to reactivate your account by logging back in for a period of 30 days after your request to leave ASKfm is processed.\nAt the end of that period, your account will be deleted and all \u201clikes\u201d which you have added to questions will be removed.\nWe will delete your data as soon as reasonably practicable, but in certain cases limited types of data, including log files and backups, may take up to 90 days to be fully deleted.\nIn order to enforce our Terms of Use and to prevent abuse of the Services, we may retain basic account information reasonably necessary to ensure a former user whose account has been terminated for breach of the Terms of Use does not open a new account and profile in further breach of our Terms of Use.\nWe may also retain additional information where we reasonably believe that we are legally obligated to do so (such as where such information may be relevant to a law enforcement investigation).\nWarning:&nbsp;After you have deactivated your account or left ASKfm, questions you have previously transmitted through the Services may still appear on the Services, but will be anonymized and no longer associated with you directly (in other words, a question you asked on your friend\u2019s profile will still be visible, but will not include your username).\nPlease also note that even after you remove information from your profile or deactivate your account, copies of such content may still be visible and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or to the extent such information has been shared with, indexed by or cached by search engines.\nSimilarly, if you have given third-party applications or websites (e.g.\nother social networks) access to your personal information, they may keep that information.\nWe cannot control this, nor do we accept any responsibility or liability for this.</p> 24.\nAre my privacy rights different depending on where I live?\n24A.\nYour rights if you live in Europe\n<p>Because you control your profile, you can see the personal information you\u2019ve provided to us by accessing your \u201cProfile\u201d page, which gives you the option to correct or update your information at any time by just logging into the Services.\nOnce you register, you will be able to change most of your personal information, including: your name.\nyour country.\nyour contact e-mail address.\nyour profile picture.\nand your password.\nYou will not be able to change your birth date.\nYou will also have the option to delete questions and answers posted to your profile at any time.\nYou have a right to request a copy of the information we hold about you.\nSuch a request must be in writing.\nYou can do this via our contact form: Feedback.\nWe will contact you to let you know what else we need from you before we send you a copy of your personal information.\nBy law, in Europe we must respond to you within 30 days.\nYou also have the right to be \u201cforgotten\u201d \u2014 that means, if you close your account and ask us to delete all your information, we need to do that.\nAlthough we are allowed to keep some of the information for security purposes in case we ever need to help the police with any criminal investigations.</p>\n24B.\nYour rights if you live in California, USA\n<p>This section only applies to individuals who are residents of California under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d).\nWe act in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nThis Privacy

store and share bits of information about your activities across websites, including on ASKfm.\nThey also allow us to remember things about your visit to ASKfm, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the site easier for you to use.</p>\n<p>ASKfm uses both session cookies and persistent cookies.\nA session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to our site.\nThese cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser after using our services.\nWe use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into ASKfm.\nA persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie.\nWe use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time.\nFor example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.</p> 2.\nWhy does ASKfm use cookies and similar technologies?\n<p>ASKfm uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags, to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways.</p>\n<p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p> (a) Authentication and security:\n<ul>\n<li>To log you into ASKfm;</li>\n<li>To protect your security.\nand</li>\n<li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate ASKfm\u2019s&nbsp;Terms of

through our services.</p> (b) Preferences:\n<ul>\n<li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences.\nand</li>\n<li>To remember your settings and other choices you have made.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you are in.\nWe can then provide you with ASKfm content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit ASKfm.</p> (c) Analytics and research:\n<ul>\n<li>To help us improve and understand how people use our services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of our services to see, which particular features or content users prefer.\nWe may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics.\nWe might also optimize and improve your experience on ASKfm by using cookies to see how you interact with our services, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.</p>\n<p>To help us better understand how people use our services, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics, Quantcast and Scorecard.\nTo find

still receive advertisements even if you opt out of tailored advertising.\nIn that case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>When accessing ASKfm from a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements.\nEach operating system: iOS, Android and Windows Phone provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements.\nYou may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements.\nFor any other

about the information collected on our services for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide the above opt-out links.\nHowever, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the internet industry is still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations, and solutions.</p> 7.\nCan ASKfm make changes to this cookie policy?\n<p>We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on the Services with a new effective date.\nIf we make a material change to our Cookie Policy, we will take reasonable steps to notify you in advance of the

" Community Guidelines <p>At ASKfm we believe that questions and answers are the key to staying close to friends, exploring the world around us and learning something new about ourselves.\nUsing anonymity makes it easier to ask questions and get to know others.</p>\n<p>With millions of users globally, our goal is to support and empower our users to create an environment on ASKfm that feels safe and inclusive.\nThat is why we have put together the following general guidelines to help you better understand what we expect from our users on ASKfm.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Respect</strong>\n<br>\nRespect is the foundation of our community.\nWe want to make sure that everyone can have a great experience on ASKfm.&nbsp;It\u2019s not OK to make a poll with photos of other users without their consent.\nWe will remove such poll, if it\u2019s reported.</p>\n<p>Remember: posting threatening, bullying or harassing questions and answers is ALWAYS unacceptable on ASKfm.</p>\n<p>It can be really easy to miscommunicate online and accidentally offend people \u2014 watch out for sarcasm with people you do not know because it can sometime cause conflict.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Real YOU</strong>\n<br>\nThere is no need to pretend to be someone else on ASKfm.\nIn fact, it\u2019s NEVER allowed.\nYou can ask anonymous questions if you want, but creating a fake profile is not OK.</p>\n<p>Remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using ASKfm if you\u2019re under 13 is a no-go.\nThe age requirement is there for your own protection.</li>\n<li>Posting spam or \u2018collecting likes\u2019 is considered rude.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>YOUR well-being</strong>\n<br>\nWhile we have put various safety tools in place, you too can do a lot to be in charge of your ASKfm experience: use settings, report or block anyone that bothers you.</p>\n<p>Remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoting and encouraging suicide, self injury and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia is unacceptable.\nThere is more info available if you need&nbsp;help.</li>\n<li>Asking yourself questions is OK, but sending yourself cruel messages is not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Respecting others</strong>\n<br>\nASKfm is proud to have people of different cultures, races, religions, and sexual orientation on the platform.\nWe are all equal and have equal rights.\nIt is unacceptable to post content which is racist, sexist, ageist or discriminatory in any other way.</p>\n<p>Terrorist organisations and violent extremist groups that intend to encourage or commit terrorist or violent criminal activity are prohibited from maintaining a presence on ASKfm to promote any of their campaigns or plans, celebrate their violent acts, fundraise, or recruit young people.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What\u2019s not OK to share?<br>\n</strong>Sometimes it can be really tricky to figure out what is and is not appropriate to post.\nFor example, remember that the following content is NEVER allowed on ASKfm:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pornographic or sexually explicit images.</li>\n<li>Nude images of yourself or others.\nThis includes naked butts and topless pics.</li>\n<li>Images that promote violence such as weapons, guns and knives or violent acts.</li>\n<li>Gory and graphic images.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sexual and abusive content related to children is illegal and it will be reported to police.</p>\n<p>For more information on how to use ASKfm read our Terms of Use or visit ASKfm Safety Centre.</p> &nbsp.\n", "created_at": "2019-01-03
