The Signal Protocol, designed by Open Whisper Systems, is the basis for WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption. This end-to-end encryption protocol is designed to prevent third parties and WhatsApp from having plaintext access to messages or calls. What\u2019s more, even if encryption keys from a user\u2019s device are ever physically compromised, they cannot be used to go back in time to decrypt previously transmitted messages.\"", "created_at": "2018-01-23 18:31:09.700379", "updated_at": "2021-02-06 03:50:21.219121", "quoteText": null, "case_id": 235, "document_id": null, "quoteStart": 1252, "quoteEnd": 1338}, {"id": 1018, "title": "[Bad] WhatsApp may sell your personal information such as phone number unless you opt-out", "source": "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/tosdr/66bjTaWs7NY", "status": "[Bad] WhatsApp may sell your personal information such as phone number unless you opt-out", "created_at": "2018-01-16 15:28:19.434667", "updated_at": "2021-02-06 03:50:47.749473", "quoteText": null, "case_id": 235, "document_id": null, "quoteStart": null, "quoteEnd": null}], "urls": ["whatsapp.com", "wa.me"]}}
