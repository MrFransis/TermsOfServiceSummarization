recognise and remember you.\nIt is sent to your browser and stored on your computer\u2019s hard drive or tablet or mobile device.\nWhen you visit our sites, we may collect information from you automatically through cookies or similar technology, such as a tag, pixel, or other web beacon.</p>\n<strong>How do we use cookies?</strong>\n<p>We use cookies in a range of ways to improve your experience on our site, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Keeping you signed in</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Understanding how you use our site</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Showing you journalism that is relevant to you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Showing you Guardian products and services that are relevant to you</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Working with partners to deliver to you relevant advertising</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, this allows us to publish the journalism that you read on our sites and apps.</p>\n<p>In the next section, we explain in more detail how we use cookies and similar technology on our sites and apps for a number of purposes.</p>\n<p>Other organisations also collect user information on our sites through cookies, tags and pixels.\nTags and pixels, also known as web beacons, are similar to cookies but are collected through embedded images.</p>\n<p>Using cookies and other technology allows other organisations to help us to analyse how our site is being used, measure the number of visitors to the site, and display advertising.\nTo accomplish these goals, Guardian utilises cookies, tags, pixels, and other web beacons to communicate information about you to others.\nIf you are a California or US resident, you may elect to opt out of all sales of personal information through these cookies, tags, pixels, and web beacons by clicking the \u201cCalifornia resident - Do not sell\u201d link located in the footer of every page or by clicking the \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d button inside our privacy banner.\nIf you are not a California or US resident, you can exercise control over this technology by visiting the \u201cPrivacy settings\u201d link in the footer of every page.\nThis page discloses all of our information sharing and gives you - the Guardian user - the opportunity to toggle on or off that sharing.\nIn this manner, you may craft a personal data sharing plan consistent with your personal privacy values.\nFor more information, please read \u201cHow to Manage Advertising Cookies\u201d below.</p>\n<p>Cookies that are used by the Guardian are referred to as \u201cfirst-party cookies\u201d and those that are used by our partners are \u201cthird-party cookies\u201d.\nBecause of how cookies work, our website cannot access third-party cookies.\nnor can other organisations access the data in the cookies we use on our website.\nThere are more details about both types of cookies in the following sections.</p>\n<strong>What types of cookies do we use?</strong>\n<p>We use four types of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Essential</strong> \u2013 cookies that are essential to provide you with services you have requested.\nFor example, these include the cookies that make it possible for you to stay logged into your Guardian account and make comments.\nIf you set your browser to block these cookies, then these functions and services will not work for you.\nIn particular, we won\u2019t be able to save your preferences about cookies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Performance</strong> - cookies which measure how often you visit our sites and how you use them.\nWe use this information to get a better sense of how our users engage with our journalism and to improve our sites and apps, so that users have a better experience.\nFor example, we collect information about which of our pages are most frequently visited, and by which types of users.\nWe also use third-party cookies to help with performance.\nFor example, the Google Analytics cookie gives us information such as your journey between pages and whether you have downloaded anything (details of how to opt out of it are below).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Functionality</strong> \u2013 cookies that are used to recognise you and remember your preferences or settings when you return to our site, so that we can provide you with a more personalised experience.\nFor example, if you are based in the United Kingdom, we will remember this and make sure that you receive the UK homepage when you visit our site, rather than the US or Australia homepage.\nA mix of first-party and third-party cookies are used.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Advertising</strong> \u2013 cookies that are used to collect information about your visit to our site, including the content you have viewed, the links you have followed and information about your browser, device and your IP address.\nWe have set out more details on this below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>How do we use cookies for advertising?</strong>\n<p>Cookies are a key part of how we deliver advertising on our sites.\nAmong other uses, they allow us to show more relevant advertising to people who visit theguardian.com by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our sites and apps.\nWe can then show you adverts which we believe may interest you.</p>\n<p>From the very first edition of the Manchester Guardian, published in 1821, our journalism has been funded in part by advertising.\nOur editorial content is not influenced by the advertising we display and our journalists are free to, and often do, challenge the activities of companies and organisations that advertise and sponsor content that appears in Guardian sites and publications.</p>\n<p>As you browse our site, some of the cookies and similar technology we place on your device are for advertising, so we can understand what sorts of pages you read and are interested in.\nWe can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests.\nFor instance, if you have been reading a lot of food and drink articles, you may be shown more adverts for food and drink from others.</p>\n<p>We are a partner in the Ozone Project that may use cookies, pixels and similar technology (see \u2018Ozone Project\u2019 and its service provider \u2018Lotame\u2019 in the table below) to collect information about what you have viewed and how you have used our sites and our app.\nThey will make assumptions about your interests and preferences and add you to groups based on those assumptions, in order to show you advertising.\nFor example, if you look at a page in our travel section you might be added to a group for people interested in holidaying abroad, and then we might show you adverts for holidays abroad.</p>\n<p>The advertising techniques we use do not collect personal data such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number.\nWe sometimes use information such as your IP address and browser type and also sometimes share some limited aspects of this with others for advertising purposes.\nUnder California law, this collected data can be considered \u201cpersonal information.\u201d Please consult the Guardian Privacy Policy for more information about your California Privacy Rights.</p>\n<p>There are times when we want to reach Guardian readers who use social media to market our own products and services such as our live events and Guardian Jobs.\nWe use cookies to help with this.\nFor example, we place a pixel on our web pages that allows Facebook to place cookies on Guardian online readers\u2019 web browsers.\nWhen a Guardian reader who uses Facebook returns to Facebook from our sites, Facebook can identify them as part of a group of Guardian readers and, on behalf of the Guardian, deliver them marketing messages from us.\nBased upon our agreements with these other companies, the data that can be obtained from a visit to the Guardian is limited to the URL of the pages that have been visited and, in some cases, the status of any unfinished or completed commercial transactions undertaken with us, together with the limited information a browser might pass on, such as its IP address.\nIn addition to the cookie controls that we mentioned above, if you are a Facebook user you can opt out by following this link.</p>\n<p>We may also share and receive online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners.\nThis means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on our sites.\nWe may also show you advertising on our sites based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.</p>\n<p>Online retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with other sites.\nThe use of cookies may mean that when you are on another site, you may be shown advertising based on what you have looked at on our sites.\nFor example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you the products you were browsing.\nThis allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.</p>\n<p>Our apps integrate third-party software that provides us with information about how the app is used and what content you have viewed for the purposes of online advertising and analytics, in a similar way to our sites.\nIt uses cookies from some of the providers listed here, among others.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, our readers fund us directly \u2013 either by buying a newspaper, or taking out a print or digital subscription or through making one-off, regular or monthly contributions.\nBut to grow that number of supporters we are reliant on marketing, and we still rely in part on advertising to fund our journalism.\nTherefore, cookies provide vital services to the Guardian without sacrificing our independence or values.</p>\n<strong>How to manage advertising cookies at the Guardian</strong>\n<p>You can manage the use of cookies on our sites, including advertising cookies, and disable the sharing of data with partners for advertising purposes by using the steps set out here.\nUnder California law, this collected data can be considered \u201cpersonal information.\u201d Please consult the Guardian Privacy Policy for more information about your California Privacy Rights.\nIn some cases you can turn off advertising cookies on a cookie-by-cookie basis, and we give the most common examples below.</p>\n<p>You can find information about how to opt out of the cookies provided by our key partners below:</p>\n<p>You can further manage the use of advertising cookies and disable the sharing of data with partners for advertising purposes by clicking the privacy settings link in the footer of this page.\nHowever, if you are located in the US, please use the \u201cCalifornia resident - Do Not Sell button\u201d instead, you can find it in the footer of every page.</p>\n<p>This option will reduce the number of advertising partners with whom we share your data, although you will still see some advertising that has been tailored to you as well as advertising intended for Guardian readers in general.</p>\n<p>You can switch some cookies off through the Your Online Choices site.\nYou may need to do this again each time you use a different IP address, device, or virtual private network.\nYou can also adjust the global privacy setting or plug-in which should be communicated to use via your browser.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to stop your browser from accepting cookies altogether by changing your browser\u2019s cookie settings.\nYou can usually find these settings in the \u201coptions\u201d or \u201cpreferences\u201d menu of your browser.\nThe following links may be helpful, or you can use the \u201cHelp\u201d option in your browser.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Cookie settings in Internet Explorer</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cookie settings in Firefox</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cookie settings in Chrome</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cookie settings in Safari web and iOS</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Useful links</strong>\n<p>If you would like to find out

our services we may add to the personal data you give us by combining it with other personal data shared with us by other trusted organisations.\nThis includes, for example, the region that you are located in, so that we can show you the prices for subscriptions or other products in your local currency.\nWe may also add personal data to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we send out mail.\nWe may also obtain your personal data from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this personal data to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing.</p>\n<p>We also use personal data based on the content you have viewed on our sites and apps and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising more relevant.\nSometimes we use data about your interests or demographics that some of our global third parties have collected from you online to add you to these groups, such as Comscore and Neilsen.\nPlease refer to our cookie policy for more information on how we use cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Personal data shared by event

13.\nSome of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.\nWe also note that California law prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless the guardian has authorized the sale.\nWe comply with this requirement.</p>\n<strong>Security of your personal data</strong>\n<p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction.\nYou are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites or apps.\nYou should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site.\nYou should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us.\nUnfortunately, sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure.\nAlthough we will do our best to protect your personal data once with us, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.</p>\n<strong>When we share or sell your personal data</strong>\n<p>\n<em>Within the Guardian group of companies</em>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia.\nWe may share it in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing

administration purposes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are going to one of our events hosted by an event partner, we may share your personal data with that partner for event administration purposes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian.\nWe may decide to

products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>With external organisations</em>\n</p>\n<p>We share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly linked to us under the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>\n<em>Service providers</em> - We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf.\nWe may do this to perform a contract we have entered into with you, where it is in our legitimate interests or with your consent.\nExamples of when we may share your data with service providers include sharing

Salesforce that assist us with our customer relationship management</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>communications services providers, such as our podcast service provider called Acast</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>error tracking software providers, such as Sentry and Google Firebase, to help us diagnose and fix errors and optimise the performance of our website and apps</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>service providers that help us carry out analytics, facilitate audience creation and segmentation and to measure our audience engagement.\nFor example, Permutive provides us with data management platform services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>service providers that help provide us with insights and analytics that help us to improve our products and services.\nFor example, we use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with our sites or apps .\nIf you don\u2019t want Google Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the \u2018Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On\u2019, provided by Google</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>data management companies, such as Formstack, that help us collect data via online forms and surveys</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>Advertising partners</em> - We may also share your data collected through our websites and apps with our advertising partners, as set out in our cookie policy.\nThese partners help us deliver relevant advertising across our websites and apps.\nFor example, we use Google Ad Manager to assist us with the delivery of relevant ads.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Agencies and authorities if required by law - </em>We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant).\nWe will attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless (i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of GNM services.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Event sponsors and partners</em> - we may share your personal data with sponsors of Guardian events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes when you have given your permission for us to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Social media organisations </em>- We may share your personal data with other organisations when our web pages use social plug-ins from these organisations (such as the \u201cFacebook Recommend\u201d function, Twitter\u2019s retweet function, Google+ function).\nThese other organisations may receive and use personal data about your visit to our sites or apps.\nIf you browse our site or view content on our apps, personal data they collect may be connected to your account on their site.\nFor more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Organisation/s that buy any of the Guardian group companies</em> - We may share your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business.\nIf this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Any organisations which access your data in the course of providing services on our behalf will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and keep to all data privacy laws that apply.\nWe may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.</p>\n<p>These transfers to third parties may constitute \u201csale\u201d of your personal information under California law.\nA California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the \u201cCalifornia resident - Do not sell\u201d link that is located in the footer of every page.\nThird-parties do not sell personal information that has been sold to them by the Guardian unless you have first received explicit notice and are provided an opportunity to exercise the right to opt out.\nYou can read further about your California rights here.\nAnyone using the Guardian, our sites, or our apps may manually inspect the sharing, transfer, and sale of their personal data in our cookie policy.</p>\n<strong>International data transfers</strong>\n<p>Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities.\nWhile other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA, including those based in the US and Australia.\nThese contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are located in the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA.</p>\n<strong>How long we keep your personal data</strong>\n<p>We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to.\nHow long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy.\nFor example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services.\nWe may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription.\nIf we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.\nIf we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data.\nHowever, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.</p>\n<strong>How we may contact you</strong>\n<p>\n<em>Service communications</em>\n</p>\n<p>From time to time

editorial newsletters</em>\n</p>\n<p>If we have your permission, we may send you materials we think may interest you, such as new Guardian offers and updates.\nDepending on your marketing preferences, this may be by email, phone, SMS or post.</p>\n<p>We offer a range of editorial newsletters.\nYou can manage your subscription to these emails through your profile page when you are signed in to your Guardian account.</p>\n<p>You can decide not to receive these emails at any time and will be able to \u201cunsubscribe\u201d directly by clicking a link in the email or through your email preferences
