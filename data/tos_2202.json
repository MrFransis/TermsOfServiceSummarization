security through the use of appropriate technical and organisational measures which are described below.\nTurnitin complies with the relevant security standards of the US, EU and Switzerland.\nThe Privacy Policy below is reviewed regularly in line with changes in global legislation.\nFor the purposes of this policy, \u2018personal data\u2019 shall have the meaning ascribed to it under the definition of \u2018personal data\u2019 under the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR).\n</p>\n<p>Turnitin complies with the security standards of the US, EU and

Legal FAQs</p> Privacy Pledge <br>\n<blockquote>\n<i>\n</i>Integrity is at the heart of all we do.\nit defines us.&nbsp;<i>\n</i>\n</blockquote>\n<em>- Chris Caren, CEO of Turnitin</em>\n<br>\n<p>The Privacy Policy below covers the kind of personal data we collect (and how), what we do with it, and how we protect any personal data you provide.\nProtecting your personal data is our top priority.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We are fully committed to transparency and using technology responsibly, no matter what changes emerge from our rapidly evolving digital world;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As we strive to create new possibilities in education, we hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards.\nWe strive to adhere to the strictest privacy practices so that your trust is well-deserved.\nand</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Because your peace of mind is important to us, we guard your personal data with the utmost care.\nWe use it only for lawful reasons.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Privacy Policy <p>\n<strong>Last Updated: 29th August 2018</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies to all businesses and group companies of Turnitin.\nThis policy describes how Turnitin collects, uses, shares, and secures the personal data you provide.\nIt also describes your choices regarding use, access, and changes to your personal data.\nData collected through our service will be limited solely to the purpose of providing the service for which you (the Client) have engaged Turnitin.\nIf and when a third-party company provides a related service to support our service, such as language translation, we make sure that when personal data is processed by them, we require that those third-party companies meet our security standards and those of the applicable legislation that applies from time to time.\n</p> Why we collect personal data <p>\n</p>\n<p>When you create an account with us, or when a student has their work processed by Turnitin, we process personal data (such as name, email address, job title, and school) so that we can correctly administer your account and provide you with the best customer service.\nAll personal data we process is directly linked to a specific purpose, such as requesting access to our academic content database, or requesting web content (i.e.\na newsletter, case study, video, etc.).</p>\n<p>At any time, you can access, update, rectify or erase any personal data by logging into your account and clicking \"User Info\" or contacting Customer Support.\nPlease see our Privacy Policy for more detailed information about how we protect your personally identifiable information.</p> Protecting your data <p>We endeavor to keep your personal data safe and secure at all times.\nDepending on the Turnitin solution used, personal data is normally processed both in Europe and in the United States with robust technical and organizational safeguards in place to protect such personal data.\nPasswords are required to access your personal data, so please remember to keep your password confidential.\nEven with the best security systems, it is impossible to guarantee 100% protection from hackers and unauthorized third parties who capture information provided over public networks.</p>\n<p>When a paper is submitted to Turnitin, it is compared against a vast, secure proprietary database of licensed source material, including millions of periodicals, academic journals, books, and web pages.\nTurnitin also maintains a separate repository of student papers.\nEach institution (at the discretion of his or her school administrator) can determine whether or not to include student papers in the repository.\nWe can remove student papers from the standard repository at the request of a school administrator.</p> Multi-jurisdictional compliance <p>As a global company, one area of ongoing debate and development concerns the mechanisms put in place to monitor cross-border data transfers.\nFor example, the Safe Harbor regime was dissolved as a global legal framework, and EU-US/EU-Swiss Privacy Shield took its place, and was later invalidated as well.\nTurnitin is fully committed to going through any reviews and certifications needed to meet new rules and requirements, no matter how complex.\nWe have recently undergone an external audit to ensure that we uphold best practices for data privacy and protection and meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs.</p> What\u2019s most important 1.\nCompliance <p>Turnitin serves a global community of educators and students, whose views on data privacy may differ significantly.\nNot only does Turnitin respect all opinions and carefully abide by the data privacy laws in each country we serve, we opt for the highest standards and aim to be leaders in the field.\nOur products and services, as well as our privacy policies, are regularly audited and inspected by both employees and external consultants to ensure that we meet, and exceed where possible, privacy expectations and requirements.\nTurnitin conducts periodic compliance reviews to verify that this Privacy Policy is accurate, comprehensive, prominently displayed, lawful, complete, implemented, and accessible.\nAny employee who violates this Privacy Policy will be subjected to disciplinary action.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>\n</p>\n<p>For data transfers outside the EEA we utilize the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU Directive 95/46/EC), which meet the adequate mechanism requirements of all EU members.\nIn each case, we put in place appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect personal data, and additional safeguards in relation to the potential impact of US laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Evolving Legislation</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Due to the ever-changing nature of legislation around data privacy, we reserve the right to make lawful changes as needed and recommend that you periodically check this Privacy Policy to see if there have been any new developments or changes.\nWe continually look for ways to move toward more robust protection.</p> 2.\nPersonal data <p>Because we provide education services, we are vocal advocates for safeguarding student data and privacy and want to make sure that parents, educators, and schools know this, which is why we took the Student Privacy Pledge, put forth by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software &amp.\nInformation Industry Association (SIIA).</p> &nbsp.\n<p>\n<strong>Data We Collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When an institution\u2019s administrator or instructor creates an account with us, we ask for their personal data such as name, email, phone, and job title, so that we can correctly administer their account and provide them with the best customer service.</p>\n<p>The type of information we request is connected to a specific purpose, namely to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verify your identity and connection with a specific institution or company, to determine your eligibility to use our services or mobile application \"Turnitin Feedback Studio\";</li>\n<li>Download content from our website, such as demos, whitepapers, or webcasts;</li>\n<li>Provide receipt and confirmation of successful text uploads;</li>\n<li>Send important messages about our service, such as any changes to functionality;</li>\n<li>Send system emails, including account setup and password retrieval information, as well as digital receipts when you submit papers to the Turnitin Database.\nand</li>\n<li>Provide additional product and service support as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use our services, the type of device you use and the version of your operating system is automatically collected.\nTurnitin collects information under the direction of its clients, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.\nTurnitin works with its clients to help them provide notice to their customers concerning the purpose for which personal data is collected.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Putting You in Control</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We always give you the choice to opt out of email communication, with the exception of system emails, such as digital receipts and password reset information.\nIn the context of processing student papers, Turnitin has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes.\nTurnitin acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information.\nAn individual who seeks access or would like to correct, amend, rectify or erase data, or should direct his/her query to the institution that is Turnitin\u2019s customer (the \u2018data controller\u2019).\nIf the customer requests that Turnitin erases the data, we will respond within 30 calendar days.\nIf you are an individual user who has questions or would like to make changes to your personal data, please contact the institution through which you use our service.</p>\n<p>Upon lawful request, Turnitin will provide information about any personal data we process.\nAt any time, customers may access, correct, change completely or anonymize the personal data that you have provided us by following these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to your account using your username and password;</li>\n<li>Click the \"User Info\" link on the navigation bar to open your user profile and view or make changes to your personal data.\nand</li>\n<li>If you have any trouble or would like for us to make changes for you, please email tiisupport@turnitin.com.\nTo honor a change request, we will need the exact information you want changed, as well as information sufficient for us to identify the type of communication you received from us.\nOur Customer Support can also provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal data.\nWe respond to requests within 30 calendar days.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Exceptional Circumstances</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may disclose your personal data in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, or similar legal process or government request when we are required by law to do so.\nIf Turnitin is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website, of any change in ownership, uses of your personal data, and choices you may have regarding your personal data.\nWe will only disclose your personal data to a third party with your prior consent.</p> 3.\nTracking technologies

anytime by logging in to your account, selecting \"User Info,\" and making changes as desired.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may also contact us at tiisupport@turnitin.com and ask that we make changes on your behalf, but to honor your request, we will need the exact information you want changed, as well as information sufficient for us to identify the type of communication you received from us.\nAnytime you provide personal data to us, you determine whether or not we may disclose such information in a personally identifiable form to a third party or use it for purposes different from the purposes for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.</p> 5.\nTransfer to third parties <p>Turnitin does not sell your personal data to third parties.\nExcept in connection with the purposes for which it was originally collected, no personal data will be provided to a third party.\nIf we transfer personal data to a third party, we will require that the third party agree to confidentiality requirements, and applicable legal requirements.\nWe will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.\nIf you do not want us to share your personal data with these companies, contact us by sending an email at tiisupport@turnitin.com.</p>\n<p>Turnitin may transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service.\nThese companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.\nTransfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our clients.</p>\n<p>Our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from ours.\nIf you submit personal data to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements.</p> 6.\nSecurity <p>We endeavor to keep your personal data safe and secure at all times.\nOur data is stored in the EU or USA with robust physical, digital, and procedural safeguards in place to protect your personal data, including the use of SSL encryption, redundant servers and data centers, and sophisticated perimeter security.\nWe continuously audit for security vulnerabilities and make software patching a priority.\nPasswords are required to access your personal data, so please remember to keep your password confidential.\nEven with the tightest security systems, no one can guarantee protection from hackers and unauthorized third parties who capture information provided over public networks.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cyber Essentials <br>(certified November 2019)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> Cyber Essentials accredits a company's IT infrastructure ensuring that its firewalls, secure configurations, user access control, malware protection, and patch management are of a high enough standard to protect any data within the company.\nTurnitin obtained the Cyber Essentials certification at the request of several international customers.\nTurnitin successfully completed a third-party audit of the effectiveness of our basic security controls.\n<p>\n<strong>SOC 2 Compliance</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p> SOC2 is an audit of a company's readiness to protect their user's privacy and the security of their data.\nThe company must show protections for both the data itself and the physical security of the locations it is stored.\nTurnitin obtained the SOC2 certification to demonstrate our commitment to security, privacy, and availability.\nTo obtain this certification, over 160 controls aligned to the SOC2 criteria were designed for Turnitin and audited for effectiveness.\nTurnitin successfully satisfied 100% of the controls audited.\n7.\nData Integrity <p>We take every possible step to make sure that the personal data in our systems is relevant for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.\nTurnitin will retain personal data we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide services to our client.\nWe retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.\nWe will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>The Turnitin database includes academic papers submitted by students and educators, as well as licensed source material sourced from the Internet.\nWhen a teacher wants to check a student paper for plagiarism, a coded engine compares it to other content in the database to check for matches.\nThe software leaves all judgment about intellectual property up to the instructor.\nIn the instance where a paper indicates a strong match to content submitted to another institution, instructors may find it necessary to request to view the matching paper.\nThis request can either be accepted or denied by an institution.\nAny paper information must be passed from instructor to instructor via email, and therefore, outside of the Turnitin product.</p>\n<p>You will at all times retain 100% ownership of your intellectual property rights.\nTurnitin does not ever assert or claim copyright ownership of any works submitted to or through our service.\nYour property is YOUR property.\nWe do not, and will not, use your intellectual property for any purpose other than to deliver, support, and develop our services, which are designed to protect and strengthen your copyright.</p> 8.\nChanges to this policy <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time.\nPlease check the Privacy Policy when you use the Site to ensure that you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices.\nOur Privacy Policy will indicate the date it was last updated.\nIf at any point we decide to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via e-mail at the last email address you have provided to us.\nYou will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.\nIf you elect not to allow us to use your information in this different manner, we will continue to use such information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.</p> 9.\nNotices <p>Please direct all inquiries regarding the Privacy Policy either to

and processing your personal data lawfully in order to earn your trust is our top priority.\nWe understand that data protection is essential for good customer service.\nAt Turnitin, our objective is to operate transparently, with accountability, and consistently with the EU and US regulatory environment so that our valued customers feel secure and in control.</p>\n<p>Turnitin is fully committed to the following practices to protect your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will never sell your data;</li>\n<li>We will never use your data for targeted advertising/profiling;</li>\n<li>We secure your data with strong encryption and security best practices in SOC2 certified data centers;</li>\n<li>We respect local privacy laws and work with legal experts to stay abreast of changes;</li>\n<li>When we collect data, we use it for a specific, stated purpose, to improve your experience and our service to you;</li>\n<li>If we need to send any of your data to a third-party, such as a language translation service provider, we require a contractual agreement that they handle and secure your data with the same high level of protection and care that we deliver.\nand</li>\n<li>We respect your right to retain ownership and control of your data, so that you can modify, update, or delete it as needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Compliance Today</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We currently meet the most stringent data protection laws across jurisdictions and are proactively reviewing every aspect of how we handle data and investing in operational measures to ensure that we continue to meet our customers\u2019 requirements.</p>\n<p>Today, Turnitin uses Standard Contractual Clauses with additional safeguards to meet varying, specific needs across the European Union (EU) for data privacy and protection.\nThese are standardized contracts to certify that any data that is transferred out of the EU is adequately protected.\nThis prevents our customers from having to request any additional authorization to use our service.</p>\n<p>We are in good standing with all standards used to ensure that data is fully protected and are able to meet very specific requirements as needed.\nThe steps we take to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We strongly recommend that institutions provide notice to students that the Turnitin service, depending on the Turnitin solution used, involves data transfer to the United States, and we recommend that consent is obtained from the student as soon as possible;</li>\n<li>Universities are free to inspect or audit our services any time;</li>\n<li>All student work and any associated personal data is encrypted and kept secure at all times.\nand</li>\n<li>Students can keep their identity secret by using a pseudonym and by submitting papers in formats that contain little if any identifying metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The GDPR had legal effect in all EU Member States from 25 May 2018.\nThe Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) was replaced by the GDPR.\nAlthough GDPR is a regulation and currently effective in all EU Member States, there are certain regulations within the GDPR that Member States will be able to legislate upon at a national level for specific reasons, therefore this policy may change accordingly from time to time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Turnitin primarily relies upon Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR for its legal basis to process such data.\nPursuant to this provision of GDPR, Turnitin relies upon the official authority of the Data Controller (the institution that is Turnitin\u2019s customer) to process student data in such a way that anti-plagiarism checks may be made to satisfy the institution that the student\u2019s work is their own.</p>\n<p>Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR also provides Turnitin with a lawful basis for processing.\nThis is that it is in the legitimate interests of the Data Controller to process such data at their discretion.</p>\n<p>Consent is not the primary basis for processing upon which Turnitin relies.\nHowever, the End-User Licence Agreement which Turnitin utilises with students will continue to be in place as a matter of best practice and transparency.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Key Aspects of the GDPR</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The following are some notable aspects of the GDPR:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The GDPR applies to all personal data processed;</li>\n<li>The GDPR makes it clear that when processing the personal data of EU nationals, data processors outside the EEA (including the US) must adhere to the GDPR and process only for lawful reasons;</li>\n<li>The GDPR requires much more accountability when processing personal data.\nPrivacy must be embedded into everything (services, software, systems, and processes) by design and by default;</li>\n<li>Individuals\u2019 rights have been strengthened.\nand</li>\n<li>To export data outside the EEA, EU Standard Contractual Clauses with additional safeguards will be used </li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on GDPR, visit

protection is essential for good customer service.\nAt Turnitin, LLC, our objective is to operate transparently and consistently with the EU regulatory environment so that you, our valued customers, feel secure and in control.</p>\n<p>Turnitin, LLC, which includes iThenticate, is fully committed to the following practices to protect your data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will never sell your data.</li>\n<li>We will never use your data for targeted advertising.</li>\n<li>We secure your data with strong encryption and security best practices.</li>\n<li>We respect local privacy laws and work with legal experts to stay abreast of changes.</li>\n<li>When we collect data, we use it for a specific, stated purpose, to improve your experience and our service to you.</li>\n<li>If we need to send any of your data to a third party, such as a language translation service provider, we require a contractual agreement that they handle and secure your data with the same high level of protection and care that we deliver.</li>\n<li>We respect your right to retain ownership and control of your data, so that you can modify, update, or delete it as needed.</li>\n</ul> Compliance today <p>We currently meet the most stringent data protection laws across jurisdictions and are proactively reviewing every aspect of how we handle data and investing in operational measures to ensure that we continue to meet our customers\u2019 requirements as data protection rules are reformed.</p>\n<p>Today, Turnitin uses Standard Contractual Clauses containing additional safeguards to meet varying, specific needs across the European Union (EU) for data privacy and protection.\nThese are standardized contracts to certify that any data that is transferred out of the EU is duly protected.\n</p>\n<p>We are in good standing with all standards used to ensure that data is fully protected and are able to meet very specific requirements as needed.\nThe steps we take to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We strongly recommend that institutions provide notice to students that the Turnitin service involves data transfer to the United States.</li>\n<li>Universities are free to audit our services any time.</li>\n<li>All student work and any associated personal information is encrypted and kept secure at all times.</li>\n<li>Students can keep their identity secret by using a pseudonym and by submitting papers in formats that contain little if any identifying metadata.</li>\n</ul> Legal changes <p>The 1995 laws that had been governing how personal data was protected in the EU were developed before smartphones and social media dominated our lives.\nFor the past few years, negotiations took place to unify and simplify the laws and guidelines used to determine what obligations companies have to protect data crossing borders in the EU.</p>\n<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in 2018.\nDirective 95/46/EC was replaced by the GDPR</p> EU data protection timeline <p>\n<b>1995</b>: The Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) creates the framework for personal data protection laws in each of the EU Member States.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2000</b>: Safe Harbor decision to accommodate data transfers outside EU.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2012</b>: The European Commission proposes a draft of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>\n<p>\n<b>2014</b>: The European Parliament votes on amended GDPR draft.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2015</b>: Safe Harbor is invalidated.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2016</b>: Final GDPR version published.\nPrivacy Shield becomes the new mechanism for transatlantic data transfers.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2018</b>: GDPR comes into effect and harmonizes EU data protection law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>2020</b>: Privacy Shield is invalidated.</p> Key differences in data protection rules <p>Turnitin fully and proactively supports the transition to simplified, more uniform application of the law as it applies to data protection in and outside of Europe.\nFollowing are some notable changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1995 Directive had different interpretations for each member state, whereas the intent of the GDPR is to provide a regulatory tool that works at the EU level.\nSo, the expectation is that there won\u2019t be as many variations needed, and that data protection applies to all.</li>\n<li>New regulations apply to ALL personal data collected, with the intent being to make it harder to profile people.</li>\n<li>The GDPR clarifies that data processors in the U.S.\nadhere to GDPR and use a valid, lawful basis to process personal information.</li>\n<li>The GDPR requires much more accountability when processing information.\nPrivacy must be embedded into everything (services, software, systems, and processes) by design and by default.\nThe expectation is that the ability to erase data will be mandatory as well.</li>\n<li>Under the GDPR, public authorities and companies that depend on processing personal information may be required to appoint a data protection officer (DPO), who will be responsible for making sure that legal data processes are upheld.</li>\n<li>Individuals\u2019 rights have been strengthened.\nFor example, cookie policies now should be much more clearly communicated and obvious.</li>\n<li>End users must be notified of data breaches within 72 hours.\nUnder the 1995 Directive, there are no uniform rules applied across the EU.</li>\n<li>To export data to the US, Standard Contractual Clauses with additional safeguards will be used.</li>\n</ul> Additional Resources

submissions\u2014a practice that helps protect and strengthen copyright ownership.</p>\n<p>A U.S.\nDistrict Court judge ruled that archiving student papers to assess the originality of newly-submitted

information.\nWe maintain extremely high levels of privacy and security through the use of SSL encryption, redundant servers, sophisticated firewalls, multiple data centers, and privacy and security audits.\nWith a security system that has never been breached and a student privacy pledge of the highest standards, instructors and students can use Turnitin with an unsurpassed level of confidence.</p> Who owns student papers once they are submitted to Turnitin? <p>Students retain the copyright of papers submitted to the Turnitin service.\nThe Turnitin user agreement entitles Turnitin to use the works as part of the plagiarism prevention system under the principles of fair use.\nTurnitin's use of student papers under fair use was settled in a United States District Court of Law in 2007 and affirmed upon appeal in 2009.</p>\n<p>Read the 2007 summary judgement </p>\n<p>Read the 2009 published decision </p> Does Turnitin archive student work? <p>Turnitin archives student papers by default only for the purposes of textual comparison.\nInstitutions may choose to not have their papers archived in the service.</p>\n<p>The fair use defense codified in Section 107 of the Copyright Act has been recognized as an \"equitable rule of reason.\" In considering whether a use is a fair use, courts often analyze whether the use is beneficial to society as a whole (as part of a determination of whether a use is transformative) and whether the user has \"clean hands.\" The District Court and Fourth Circuit both held that the archiving of student works in the educational context is a fair use.\nIn so holding, the courts did not find that Turnitin's use of student works was in any respect unethical.</p> How does Turnitin comply with privacy regulations of different countries? <p>As a US company with high standards for security and privacy, Turnitin is designed to comply with many of the data protection requirements of other countries, including informed consent, access rights of submitting students, and technical and organizational measures to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of personal data.</p> Am I bound to the Turnitin click-through agreement? What if I'm a minor? <p>Yes.\nThe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found that the online click-through agreement on the Turnitin site is an enforceable agreement, even against minors.\nParental consent or the consent of a guardian is required for a minor to set up an account with Turnitin and the agreement is therefore binding.</p> Can a teacher compel me to submit my paper to Turnitin if I attend private school? Public school? <p>Yes in both cases.\nIf you attend a private school you have agreed to abide by the school's policies.</p>\n<p>With respect to public school, as the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has recognized in rejecting four students' claim that they were improperly compelled to submit their papers to Turnitin or face a failing grade, \"Schools have a right to decide how to monitor and address plagiarism in their schools and may employ companies like Turnitin to help do so.\"</p> Does Turnitin share information with third-party services? <p>Turnitin integrates with third-party services such at the Educational Testing Service and Language Weaver where student information may be shared in order to deliver a part of these services.\nWhile Turnitin does transfer information where necessary to perform the service, no personally identifiable information such as name, email or school is sent by Turnitin to third-party services.</p> Does Turnitin comply with FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)? <p>Yes.\nThe Turnitin service is compliant with and helps institutions comply with FERPA, including:</p>\n<p>Turnitin expects and suggests that institutions comply with FERPA\u2019s notice requirements regarding the use and disclosure of directory and non-directory education records so that students and parents are aware that the school may engage services like Turnitin.</p>\n<p>Institutions are free to inspect or audit our services to assure themselves that all information is used only for the purposes of assisting instructors.</p>\n<p>Data is kept secure at all times and are only used for purposes of assisting the instructor in assessing the assignment.</p>\n<p>Users may submit their paper using a pseudonym and in formats that contain little, if any, identifying metadata.\nThis reduces our chance of collecting and processing personal data.</p> Does Turnitin comply with COPPA (Child Online Privacy Protection Act)? <p>Yes.\nThe FTC has specifically stated that COPPA\u2019s requirements do not apply to sites that contract with schools to offer online programs for the benefit of the schools and their students, and collect personal information only for these purposes.\n(FTC COPPA FAQ #55.) Thus, these services are not required to get prior verifiable parental consent before collecting or maintaining personal information.\nTurnitin\u2019s services, which include originality checks and online grading, are offered pursuant to Turnitin\u2019s contracts with school districts, and Turnitin does not collect personal information for other purposes.\nThe FTC has said that in such circumstances, operators like Turnitin may presume that the school has authorized the collection of personal information based upon the school having obtained the parents\u2019 consent.\nSchools often obtain parental consent via Acceptable Use Policies that they provide to students and parents.\nIn addition, COPPA also allows, but does not require, schools to act as agents on behalf of parents and to provide consent for the online collection of a student\u2019s personal information within the school context.\n(FTC COPPA FAQ #54.)</p> Who can I contact at Turnitin if I have privacy concerns?

that such processing is necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or in the exercise of the official authority vested in the Controller (Article 6(1)(e) GDPR).\nThe 'Controller' is the institution instructing You to submit Your work through the Turnitin service, and they have official authority to subject Your work to originality checks.\nAs such, Your consent to such processing is not required.\nTurnitin's Data Protection Officer can be contacted at DPO@turnitin.com.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where the Controller is not a public authority, processing of Your Personal Data is also lawful because it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Controller (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The provision of Your Personal Data is necessary in order for Your institution to perform its contract with Turnitin.\nYou are obliged to provide Your Personal Data so that Your institution can carry out the official authority vested in it to assess Your work.\nFailure to do so may have adverse consequences with regard to Your relationship with Your institution or may be contrary to any terms of use You have agreed with your institution.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Turnitin may transfer Your Personal Data from the European Economic Area to the USA.\nWhen it does so, adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that the Personal Data is handled securely in the USA.\nTurnitin is Privacy Shield certified, a mechanism recognized by the European Commission as being adequate.\nTurnitin's Privacy Shield certification can be viewed at www.privacyshield.gov/list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Turnitin adheres to the EU Model Contract Clauses on data transfer (according to EU Commission Decision 87/2010/EC).\nThe EU Model Contract Clauses are also recognized as an adequate mechanism by the European Commission.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Where a sub-processor is utilized in the performance of the Turnitin Services, they will be restricted to those sub-processors that are necessary in the technical performance of the Services, such as data centre and software providers.\nTurnitin ensures that such sub-processors are GDPR compliant by way of written contracts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Your Personal Data is encrypted in storage.\nUnless otherwise instructed by the Controller, it will be stored indefinitely in encrypted form and may be used to assess originality of other submissions in the future.\nTurnitin adds student papers to a private, proprietary database (which is not publically accessible) indefinitely unless its customer requests deletion of such Personal Data.\nSuch archiving is compatible with the purposes for which the Personal data was collected.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have the right to request from the Controller (Your institution) access to, rectification of, or erasure of Personal Data, or restriction of such processing as well as the right to Personal Data portability.\nYou have the right to complain to the Controller and/or your national Supervisory Authority in the event of non-compliance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>No automated decision making or profiling is undertaken by Turnitin in
