Service</u>\n<br>\n<br>\nCryptostorm has a long history of pushing past the assumed limits of the possible &amp.\nproviding previously-unavailable levels of privacy protection to our customers.<br>Our Terms of Service (ToS) are no exception.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>First</b>, as a precursor of sorts, we established the cryptostorm network to assist people throughout the world in a mature effort to protect individual freedom while on the Internet.\nYou may also label us a network transport provider: this means we pass encrypted packets back and forth, PERIOD.\nThe company does not host content, serve resources, or log anything you are doing - none of that is our business.\nIn fact, as part of our business model we have stood tall and reached out to dissidents in places such as Iran, Tibet, and Cuba (just to name a few), providing free accounts to those trying to get honest current information out to friends, family, and people on the 'net as a whole.\nWe believe these efforts - while not directly profitable to us economically - provide a more than worthwhile return both to the global community, and to the betterment of the Internet.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Second</b>, we ask that you don't do anything blatantly dumb while using our service.\nPlease do not send massive volumes of spam through our network.\nIt adds to our workload, and it just ends up getting our IP's blocked from big chunks of IP-space (which means your spam won't arrive anyway).\nOur network is also not a place to 'hack' from (related: nor are we a good transit path through which to route your DDoS attacks, not even c&amp;c).\nIf you don't know why that's true - and you don't already know how to cover your ass without using a commercial VPN service - then you'd best reconsider what you're doing, because you are in <i>way</i> over your head.\nOur $0.02.\nWe won't betray you if you do, but there's smarter ways to cover your tracks doing such things.\nPoint being: if you don't already know that, then you shouldn't be hacking or DDoSing anyway.\nCrawl, walk, run...\nthat sort of thing.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Third</b>, we request that you not push any sort of child porn or underage sexual content through our network.\nThe company has always been opposed to it.\nWe're honest and forthright, and we ask that you respect that.\nWe don't packet sniff, log anything at all, or have an 'Abuse Team' (as many of our self-styled \"competitors\" do, whether they admit it or not) - but we do have a crack staff that will do anything within their power (outside of compromising our company stance on customer privacy) to put a stop to CP pushing across our network.\nSame goes for terrorist-related activities.\nDon't, seriously.\nWe're not designed to protect either of those areas of activity - CP or terrorism - and we don't expect to be asked to.\nYes, there's plenty of grey areas in those definitions.\nwe get that.\nBut if you're well beyond the grey and you're doing really bad shit, don't use us.\nWe're not morality police and we're not here to enforce the world's laws (nor are we legally obligated to do so - we're not cops and have no desire to be such), but we're also not running this network so you can sell CP or plan to kill people (or other beings).\nProtip: use Tor.\nActually, just don't do either of those things, and the world will be a better place.\nAgain, our $0.02.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nIn conclusion, a valid network access token gains you access to cryptostorm.\nAs a result of our token-based authentication model, there's structurally no way we can \"shut off\" an individual customer (even if we wanted to, which we don't).\nAs a packet-routing service, we're in the business of (securely) routing authenticated packets - not in \"managing customers\".<br>Irrespective of that, we receive hundreds of DMCA letters a week - and respond to them individually with a (mostly) polite explanation of our operational model, cryptographic framerwork, and member-agnostic authentication topology.\nMost of these letters come from spambots run by shady copytrolls: these spam operations are illegal in numerous global jurisdictions, although of course LEO doesn't prosecute them since they often have strong political connections (rule of law, eh?).\nWe've been explaining the reality of things to spambot copytrolls for more than half a decade, but the \"demand letters\" for us to \"takedown\" content we neither host nor control keep on comin'...\nlol.\nNo matter.\nour network members have never had to deal with a single one of these DMCA harassment letters...\nand they never will.<br>\n<br>\n<br> ", "created_at": "2022-04-12 20:24:40.357835", "updated_at": "2022-04-12 18:25:32.164904"}, {"id": 11818, "name": "Privacy Policy",

policy was written in 2013, which might make it seem outdated, but the fact is we haven't ever updated it because our data policies have remained the same.<br>\ncryptostorm has no active business entities in any EU member state at the moment, but we do believe that every nation should be creating and enforcing data protection legislation like the GDPR.<br>\nFor that reason, we thought we'd rewrite the old privacy policy and see if we could provide more (probably too many) technical details on exactly how the whole ordering/connecting process works, what's being logged, and what to do if you don't want us to retain what little data we do have.<br>\n<br>\nThe first step any potential customer would take is visiting this site, https://cryptostorm.is.\nThis is an Apache webserver that has mostly default logging, which means the log will contain visitor IPs, user agents (browser), referrer (where you came from), the file you're requesting, and the time/date of the request.\nWe have no reason to maintain historical records of our web visitors, so those logs are rotated/deleted automatically after 2 weeks.\nThe reason these logs exist is because it's virtually impossible to maintain security on a web server without these access/error logs.<br>\nIf you don't want your real IP address to show up in those web logs, you can also reach this website at the .onion address stormwayszuh4juycoy4kwoww5gvcu2c4tdtpkup667pdwe4qenzwayd.onion.<br>\nIf visiting this website on the clearnet is necessary, or not a big deal in your threat model, you can also visit this website using Tor Browser, Cryptofree, any type of proxy, or a competitor's VPN service.<br>\nTo keep your browser/user agent hidden from us, you can use any one of the many user agent changing browser addons, such as User Agent Switcher for Firefox, or User-Agent Switcher for Chrome.<br>\nFor the referrer, browser addons such as Change Referer Button for Firefox or Referer Control for Chrome is what you're looking for.<br>\nIf for whatever reason you can't wait the 2 weeks for the web logs to purge themselves, you can always email support@cryptostorm.is and ask us to remove you from the web logs early.<br>\n<br>\nThe second step in the ordering process is selecting a payment method to use on the https://cryptostorm.is/#section5 page.<br>\nNo matter what payment method you choose, the data we retain is always the same: email, token delivered, and a transaction ID provided by the payment processor.<br>\nFor security reasons, after about 2 weeks, that data is manually encrypted and sent to an offsite backup server, leaving only the transaction ID for reasons explained below.<br>\nThe email address you provide is only used to deliver the token, and the token is retained for re-delivery in case you lose your token.<br>\nThe transaction ID is used to prevent duplicate orders from being processed twice, which is necessary because the entire ordering/delivery process is fully automated.<br>\nIn the case of Bitcoin payments through Bitpay, we also provide an option that allows you to opt-out of email delivery.\nWhen you choose that option, we send Bitpay a local '@cryptostorm.is' email address for the order, because Bitpay requires an email address, and since we host our email on the same server as this website, the email never leaves for the internet.<br>\nAt the moment, we can't offer the same option for PayPal orders due to limitations in the PayPal IPN, nor can we offer it for CoinPayments.net orders due to the amount of time it generally takes for most of those alternative cryptocurrencies to confirm the transaction.<br>\nThe tokens used by the automated delivery process come from a simple flat database that is manually loaded after minting the tokens on a separate server that holds the authentication database.<br>\nAgain, if for some reason you want your token/email removed from our delivery log or it's offsite/encrypted backup, just email support@cryptostorm.is and ask.<br>\n<br>\nThe third step, once a customer has their token, is connecting to cryptostorm.<br>\nWhenever a customer connects to any node, that node will authenticate the provided token by connecting to a separate/dedicated web server that hosts an API that accesses the actual authentication database running on the same server.<br>\nThat authentication database is a simple MySQL database that uses the following columns:\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| activated_at | varchar(20) | YES | | NULL | |\n| duration | int(11) | YES | | NULL | |\n| hash | varchar(129) | YES | | NULL | |\n| session_count | int(11) | YES | | NULL | |\n+---------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\nThe 'activated_at' field is NULL to begin with, then later filled with the current time/date in UNIX time format whenever the customer connects for the first time.\nThis field allows tokens to expire whenever they're supposed to.<br>\nThe 'duration' field contains the token's length, or duration, in days (i.e., 31, 7, 365, etc.).\nThis field is used by https://cryptostorm.nu to let customers know how many days their token has left until expiration, and it's also used to enforce simultanous connection limits.<br>\nThe 'hash' field is the sha512 hash of the plaintext token.\nWhenever tokens are minted, the hash goes into this database on the auth server, and the plaintext token goes into the delivery server's flat database.\nThat keeps the authentication database from knowing the plaintext token after minting, and it keeps the nodes from ever knowing the plaintext token.<br>\nAnd finally, 'session_count' is self-explanatory.\nOpenVPN on the server increases this field when a customer connects, using the script available at https://cryptostorm.is/conf/session_up.sh.txt, and it decreases this field using https://cryptostorm.is/conf/session_down.sh.txt when they disconnect.<br>\nThe OpenVPN server-side authentication is done by using the --auth-user-pass-verify script available at https://cryptostorm.is/conf/auth.sh.txt<br>\nAs you can see from the above three scripts, the only data ever sent from the nodes to the authentication server API is your token's sha512 hash, and it's always sent using HTTPS.<br>\n<br>\nWhile connected to cryptostorm, none of the log files will ever contain any data that could be used to identify a customer:\n[root@zuna ~]# ls -la /var/log/\ntotal 102508\ndrwxr-xr-x.\n4 root root 4096 May 26 08:07 .\ndrwxr-xr-x.\n21 root root 4096 Aug 11 2017 ..\ndrwxr-x---.\n2 root root 4096 May

activity that's only used by crontab and OpenSSH, neither of which are used for customer related activities.<br>\nThe 'cron' directory contains output/errors from crontab, which is useful for debugging any potential problems we might be having with our cronjobs.<br>\n'lastlog' and 'wtmp' contain login data of the administrators who've logged in to the server at the console or using OpenSSH.<br>\n'messages' contains kernel messages, such as grsec execv() data, which allows us to monitor the node for unauthorized command execution.<br>\nAnd finally, the 'snort' directory contains a single 'alert' file that contains minimal data about positive hits against our snort IPS that we use to prevent basic forms of abuse (automated vulnerability scanning, brute force attacks, etc.).\nThis 'alert' log never contains any real client IPs, only their internal VPN IP (10.x.x.x), and it's rotated/purged often.<br>\nHistorical bandwidth usage data is collected by vnstat, but this data is NOT per-session or per-instance, it's for the entire server.\nWe use this data to determine whether or not a node is getting so much traffic that it needs a secondary server to balance things out.<br>\nAgain, none of the above log files ever contain any data that could be used to identify a customer.<br>\n<br>\nI hope this information is useful to anyone curious about how our systems work, and if you have any more questions that aren't answered here, feel free to email support@cryptostorm.is.<br>\n<br> ", "created_at": "2022-04-12 20:24:40.35498", "updated_at": "2022-04-12
