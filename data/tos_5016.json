date: May 08, 2021</strong>\n</p> Human Interpretation <p>MXroute LLC is a Limited Liability Corporation in the state of Texas.\nAll services provided by MXroute may be used for lawful purposes only.\nTransmission, storage or presentation of any information, data or material in violation of any United States federal, state or city law is prohibited.\nThis includes, but is not limited to: copyrighted material, material we judge to be threatening or obscene, or material protected by trade secret and other statute.\nThe subscriber agrees to indemnify and hold harmless MXroute from any claims resulting from the use of service which damages the subscriber or any other party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We\u2019re an LLC out of Texas and bound by US law, so don\u2019t use us to violate the law that we\u2019re accountable to.</p> Functional Service\n<p>In these terms we will refer to service functionality.\nWe define functional service as being able to send email that does not trigger our spam filters or rate limits, and the ability to receive mail.\nFailure to properly configure DNS will not be considered as breaking the service\u2019s ability to function as sold.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We define our service as \u201cworking\u201d when you haven\u2019t sent spam or misconfigured your own settings.</p> Legitimate Usage\n<p>The domains that you add to our system should be legitimate, managed by you or your customers, and not related to any spam/scam activity in any way.\nWhile we cannot describe in perfect detail everything that qualifies as spam/scam activity, we reserve the right to make a decision about it based on information that we learn.\nThis includes, but may not be limited to, domains that are intended to confuse recipients into thinking you are representing a domain that you do not control by use of misspellings, etc.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: Frankly, clients adding domains that contained the strings \u201cgmail\u201d and \u201cyahoo\u201d are what led to this policy, and that may provide some context.\nWe don\u2019t want any part of any effort by you or your customers to spam, scam, or mislead anyone.\nEven if you\u2019re not using us to send email, we want no connection to any of these things.</p> Support Treatment / Expectations\n<p>As a budget provider we do rely on many of our automations to handle basic functions, and requests for manual intervention can take some time (more so when not impacting the functionality of the service).\nWe will not tolerate being rude or threatening to our staff.\nWe will not tolerate threats of chargeback/payment dispute as an attempt to escalate low priority issues that do not stop the service from functioning.\nBeing rude or threatening (including threat of chargeback / payment dispute) will result in immediate account termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: Basically, \u201cdon\u2019t be a dick.\u201d We expect to be treated with respect when you\u2019re dealing with us, because we don\u2019t have to do business with you.\nIf you intentionally berate us in our support channels, we\u2019ll gladly cut ties.</p> Server Abuse\n<p>Any attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server or customer of MXroute is strictly prohibited.\nAs our customer you are responsible for all your accounts.\nThis includes abuse of the server\u2019s CPU and RAM resources to a degree that effects the performance of other customers on your server.\nShould you violate the Terms of Services outlined within, your account will be cancelled without chance of refund.\nIf you abuse system resources, you will be contacted and offered options for accomodating or reducing usage prior to having your service terminated.\nAbusive processes, however, will be shut down prior to our attempts to contact you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: Abuse is when you find a way to drain all of our system resources and force the entire service to it\u2019s knees by unimagineably high usage.\nFor example, creating one billion email accounts and signing them all up for a thousand newsletters each.\nThat\u2019s not legitimate usage, that\u2019s a denial of service attack.&nbsp;</p> Valid DNS Records\n<p>You are required to have valid SPF and MX records on domains that send through our service.\nFailure to do so results in reduced sending reputation for your domain and our IP addresses, which can result in us parting ways to ensure high quality sending for our other customers.\nThe SPF and MX records are given to you in an email sent after you pay for service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We want to get your email into the inbox and not spam folders.\nEvery customer plays a role in our IP reputation.\nYou ask the best of us, we ask that you not drag everyone else down by sending email that is destined to fail by your design.</p> Refusal of Service\n<p>We reserve the right to refuse, cancel or suspend service, at our sole discretion.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We can\u2019t possibly outline every future scenario that will cause us to recognize that we\u2019ve entered into a toxic relationship.\nWe\u2019ll know it when we see it, we\u2019ll do our best to accomodate you and be kind about it, but we always have the right to deny service.</p> Forbidden Services\n<p>We are unable to provide services to the following customers due to consistently negative experiences with bounce rates and spam reports:</p>\n<p>\u2013 Leak forums.\nThese are forums where users share compromised accounts for internet services.<br>\u2013 Adult forums.\nThese are forums where users trade pornography.<br>\u2013 Hundreds of emails at a time to qq.com.\nIf you send almost exclusively to qq.com, and hundreds of emails at a time, we are unable to provide you with service.<br>\u2013 Deceptive use against third party services like signing up for hundreds or thousands of accounts for a website using a catchall and randomly generated email aliases.<br>\u2013 Forward-only service for massive numbers of domains on one account (maximum impact on our servers, minimal cost and spreading out of domains)<br>\u2013 Sending SMS via email.<br>\u2013 Bulk marketing email.<br>\u2013 \u201cWarmup\u201d services.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Commentary: Honestly we\u2019ll never be able to list every possible use case that we feel negatively impacts our service or facilitates current/future uses that negatively impact the service.\nThe bottom line is that our customers are our priority, and they have a lot of needs.\nWe cannot allow anyone to come in and perform actions that risk our ability to provide what our customers need.\nThey need clean IP reputation, consistent ability to send mail to major services, things like that.\nThese are just some common use cases that we felt worth calling out and clarifying in our policy.</p> Spoofing Senders\n<p>Under no circumstances are MXroute customers permitted to spoof \u201cFrom\u201d headers to display a third party service.\nYou are not authorized to directly send as (meaning the domain in the \u201cFrom\u201d header) any domain that you do not own or manage.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Commentary: You don\u2019t own gmail.com and we\u2019re not authorized by Google to send as gmail.com, so you are not to risk our IP reputation with Google and others who follow standards by faking your email headers to claim your email is from gmail.com.\nGmail is the example, there are an unlimited number of others you could do this with.</p> Sending Limits\n<p>Each email account will be limited to 300 outbound emails per hour unless a prior agreement has been reached.\nYou may not create additional email accounts for the sole purpose of extending that limit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Commentary: We\u2019re not a bulk email provider.\nIf your transactional email needs to exceed that, and it is of high desirability for recipients, double opt in, and of high quality then you may be eligible for an exception.\nThe exception would be for minor increases, we\u2019re not prepared to sustain extremely large senders.</p> Spam Reports\n<p>If your recipient actively clicks a \u201cReport Spam\u201d (or equivalent) button at their email provider, and we are made aware of it, we will block outbound mail to that address.\nThis is interpreted as claiming that you are sending them email that they do not want, and the potential damage is to the reputation of your domain and our IP addresses.\nIf this occurs unintentionally, you will need to negotiate with the user and ask us to unblock outbound email to them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Commentary: At best, clicking \u201cReport Spam\u201d on your legitimate email is an accident that can potentially harm both of us by training spam filters.\nAt worst, it\u2019s a malicious attack against both of us.\nEither way, it shouldn\u2019t be brushed off and treated as a minor event.</p> Damaging IP Reputation\n<p>If your email behavior consistently harms the reputation of our IP addresses and causes delayed or failed deliveries for other customers, we reserve the right to cancel your service.\nThis includes repeat failures to secure your accounts by using strong passwords, as password security is your responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: Though rare, it is entirely possible for you to send legitimate and desirable emails that repeatedly harm the reputation of our IPs (and by extension, the rest of our customers).\nWe cannot predict or outline in advance the situations that lead to this, but it isn\u2019t common.\nWe won\u2019t be unfriendly in closing the account, but we also won\u2019t trade every other customer for one.</p> Backups\n<p>Accounts are backed up frequently in case of hardware failure.\nBackups are not guaranteed and are provided as a courtesy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We do backups, but the primary reason for this is so that we can rebuild in the case of a failure.\nWe\u2019re not intending to use these backups to hunt for that email you accidentally deleted last week.</p> Billing\n<p>By the Account Activation Date of each month, MXroute shall either:</p>\n<p>(1) charge the client\u2019s chosen billing method through the associated PayPal subscription.\nor<br>(2) deliver, by e-mail or regular mail, an invoice in accordance with the applicable Service Fees for services rendered for the current month.\nWhen an invoice is delivered to the client, payment shall be remitted to MXroute by no later than the specified payment due date.\nMXroute shall be entitled to immediately terminate this agreement for client\u2019s failure to make timely payments.\nYou will be provided with an invoice on a monthly basis.\nAll PayPal subscriptions are automatically processed through PayPal and charged to the default or backup payment method that you selected upon signup.\nIt is the client\u2019s responsibility to ensure that they have sufficient credit to cover this transaction.\nIn the event that there is insufficient funding, we will send an e-mail notification, at which point the client must resolve the issue with PayPal within 24 hours.\nIf we do not receive a response within 24 hours, the account, and all accounts under that account plan, may be suspended.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We do charge money for our service, and these are the terms you agree to for that billing.</p> Money back guarantee &amp.\nrefund policy\n<p>We do not refund cancelled contracts.\nExceptions will be made where MXroute is found to have failed to uphold it\u2019s guarantees.\nIf you feel that a refund is warranted we encourage you to contact us on Chat.\nIn case of policy violations, any and all refunds are forfeit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We don\u2019t do refunds.\nWhy? Because people kept signing up and asking for refunds, and we\u2019re trying to get those people to just not sign up instead.\nHow horrible would it be if we had to increase our prices to accomodate the constant requests of people who aren\u2019t even paying us money? That\u2019s bad for our customers, so we\u2019re not doing it.</p> Chargebacks\n<p>We operate a support desk where we intend to resolve issues.\nOpening a payment dispute with our payment gateway or your funding source is a violation of MXroute policy and will result in service termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: If you have a problem you should come to us, not our payment processor.\nComplaints to our payment processors are complaints against our company.\nNotice PayPal disputes require you to select that something is wrong like we didn\u2019t provide the service we described, or we didn\u2019t provide the service at all.\nWe always provide exactly what we sell, and if for some strange reason we don\u2019t then we do actually refund, but otherwise making such a declaration against us is fraudulent and is taken with offense.</p> Accurate Information\n<p>Customers are required to provide accurate billing information on registration, and maintain accurate billing information in our billing portal.\nFailure to provide accurate information will lead to account suspension, up to account termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: If we know that your name and address are fake, we may be liable for your activities.\nIt is our responsibility to not find ourselves in this situation.</p> Cancellation Refunds\n<p>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> refund partial monthly fees to accounts.\nAccount cancellations may take up to 72 hours to process and we encourage you to plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: If you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re signing up for, don\u2019t sign up.\nDon\u2019t use refund requests as product trials, we don\u2019t offer trials, nor will we let you force us into offering trials by requesting refunds because you didn\u2019t know what you were ordering.</p> Limitation of Liability\n<p>MXroute shall not be responsible for any claimed damages, including incidental and consequential damages, which may arise from MXroute servers going off-line or being unavailable for any reason whatsoever.\nFurthermore, MXroute shall not be responsible for any claimed damages, including incidental or consequential damages, resulting from the corruption or deletion of any files from one of MXroute\u2019s servers.\nAll damages shall be limited to the immediate termination of service.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We\u2019re responsible for our service, you are responsible for yours.\nWe reject any notion that we are responsible for any losses that you perceive to be our responsibility.&nbsp;</p> Violations\n<p>Violations of these policies should be referred to abuse@mxroute.com.\nAll complaints will be investigated promptly.\nFailure to follow any term or condition will be grounds for immediate account termination.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: If you know that an MXroute customer is violating our policies, feel free to report them to us.</p> Disclaimer\n<p>MXroute cannot be held liable for system down time, crashes or data loss.\nWe cannot be held liable for any predicated estimate of profits which a client would have gained if their service was functioning.\nCertain services provided by MXroute are resold.\nThus, certain equipment, routing, software and programming used by MXroute are not directly owned or written by MXroute.\nMoreover, MXroute holds no responsibility for the use of our clients\u2019 accounts.\nFailure to comply with any terms or conditions will result in the automatic deactivation of the account in question.\nWe reserve the right to remove any account, without advance notice for any reason without restitution, as MXroute sees fit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We license WHMCS, DirectAdmin, cPanel, and we rent servers in data centers that we\u2019ve selected.\nWhile we consider it our responsibility to make the best choices and keep things online, we are not liable for failures at all levels and deny responsibility for any damages you perceive as being our responsibility.</p> Server Uptime Guarantee\n<p>MXroute guarantees 99% service (pop, imap, smtp) uptime on all hosting plans.\nShould we fail to deliver this for any given calendar month, your account will be refunded a pro-rated amount for the duration of excessive downtime upon request.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: This doesn\u2019t mean we aim for 99% uptime, it means we aim for AT LEAST 99% uptime.\nThings happen, the internet is not a flawless design to begin with, and neither are computers.&nbsp;</p> Spam\n<p>Outgoing spam from our servers will not be tolerated.\nSpam is defined as unsolicited e-mail.\nAll mailing lists must be double opt-in, meaning that clients must sign up and then verify their e-mail address to be added to your mailing list.\nViolations of this policy will result in service termination.\nSpam found to be intentional will result in us sharing your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, IP address, signup domain, and PayPal e-mail address with FraudRecord.com.\nAdditionally, intentional unsolicited marketing emails will be billed at a rate of $1 per email.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: We know intentional spam from unintentional spam.\nWe know a password compromise from you sending an unsolicited marketing email for your company.\nHow we do that is a trick of the trade, but there\u2019s no room for false positive.\nIf we terminate you for spamming, you did it and you know it.\nPlenty of customers accidentally send spam due to compromised systems on their side, and we only terminate for that if we\u2019ve been asking you to fix it forever and it just won\u2019t stop happening.</p> Account Activation\n<p>By activating your account with MXroute, you agree to the above policies and disclaimer.\nUpon requesting activation of an account, you are required to accept these policies, guidelines and disclaimer, and a copy of your acceptance is forwarded along with your activation request to be maintained with your account information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: If you don\u2019t agree with our policies, don\u2019t sign up!</p> Privacy\n<p>With exception of FraudRecord.com in the case of billing chargebacks and intentional spam, we do not share your information with any third party.\nWe do monitor email logs and login activity so that we might be proactive in response to any issues whether technical or security.\nWe do not read your email unless instructed by you to do so.\nWe do review logs that include sender, recipient, and subject when you make a support request.</p>\n<p>Commentary: If we\u2019re going to get you into inboxes instead of the spam folder, we have to know what\u2019s happening in our network to stop spammers from destroying IP reputation.\nWe\u2019re not spying on the contents of your email, but we know who our top senders are and we know the subject of their frequently repeated emails.\nThe only time we send your information to a third party is when you fraudulently accuse us of misdeeds to our payment processors.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>MXroute reserves the right to amend any or all of the above policies, guidelines and disclaimer without notification.\nWe also retain the right to increase any pricing and make changes to our account plans without notification.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Commentary: Sometimes policies change, but only to address new trends, not to change the heart of our business.\nWe do increase pricing from time to time, but NEVER on existing customers/services.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-09-05 00:26:26.385147", "updated_at": "2021-09-04 22:27:35.067425"}], "points": [], "urls":
