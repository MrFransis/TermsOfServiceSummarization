Educational Rights Protection Act of 1974 (FERPA).</p> What is FERPA?\n<p>FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 or the Buckley Amendment, is a federal law that affords students certain rights with respect to their education records.</p> What is an Education Record?\n<p>An education record contains information directly related to a student and are maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution.\n</p>\n<p>Combinations of student names, courses, and video recordings are considered an education record.</p>\n<p>Note:Proctorio acts as a third party and must maintain compliance with FERPA on behalf of the institution.</p> Why is FERPA important?\n<p>FERPA protects students from having their information disseminated to third parties without the student's consent.\nBy utilizing a third party, an institution extends their liability to adhere to FERPA to the third party.\nBeyond ethics and privacy, an institution's Title IV funding is tied to compliance with this act.</p> How does Proctorio comply with FERPA?\n<p>We are FERPA certified by the Internet Keep Safe Coalition which signifies our compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\nPlease see our Personal Data Protections page for more information.</p>\n<p>Proctorio never holds unencrypted education records.\nAll data that enters our system has been encrypted by the learning management system (LMS) and can only be unlocked by authorized users within the LMS.\nProctorio utilizes the LMS to gain information about the user's role.\nThis restricts information from being shared with users who do not fall under the \"School Official\" role.\nThe entire process is transparent to the end-user, but prevents Proctorio and unauthorized individuals from accessing to student data.</p>\n<p>Note:Proctorio implements a zero-knowledge encryption scheme to keep your information safe.</p>\n<p>Proctorio will never hold any personally identifiable information (PII) and institutions can feel confident in extending their FERPA liability to Proctorio.\n</p>\n<p>Proctorio delivers all content via SSL (TLS 1.2) and our servers are compliant to many standards including PCI and HIPAA.\n</p>\n<p>When going through technical support channels, our representatives will never ask for information beyond what FERPA defines as \"Directory Information\".\nOur representatives may ask for the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Student name</li>\n<li>Campus e-mail address</li>\n<li>College or school</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite not collecting any personally identifiable information, all employees are subject to frequent and thorough FERPA training.\nAny personal information requests beyond this should be reported to privacy@proctorio.com.</p> How is Proctorio different?\n<p>Other technologies require the student to create accounts on their platform, enter credit card information on their platform, and will store unencrypted video on their platform.\nThis information is all categorized as personally identifiable information or as an education record and, therefore, falls under the jurisdiction of FERPA.\nAny breach of this data could result in the loss of Title IV funding for institutions who have contracted the third party.</p>\n<p>Note:Proctorio will never ask for nor store this information.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-02-03 13:33:23.978766", "updated_at": "2021-02-03 13:33:26.114746"}, {"id": 3928, "name": "Terms of Service", "url": "https://proctorio.com/terms",

Act of 1998.</p> What is COPPA?\n<p>Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in 1998.\nCOPPA requires the Federal Trade Commission to issue and enforce regulations concerning children's online privacy.\nCOPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.</p> Why is COPPA important?\n<p>COPPA requires websites to give parents a choice as to whether their child's information can be disclosed to third parties, and give parents a chance to prevent further use or future collection of personal information from their child.\nParents must also, upon request, be given access to the personal information collected from their child and a means of reviewing that information.</p> How does Proctorio comply with COPPA?\n<p>We are COPPA certified by the Internet Keep Safe Coalition which signifies our compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\nPlease see our Personal Data Protections page for more information.</p>\n<p>Proctorio does not disseminate personal information to third parties for any use.\nAll data that enters our system has been encrypted using an unshared key stored in the learning management system (LMS) and can only be unlocked by authorized users within the LMS.\nProctorio utilizes the LMS to gain information about the user's role.\nThis restricts information from being shared with users who do not fall under the \"School Official\" role.\nThe entire process is transparent to the end-user, but prevents Proctorio and unauthorized individuals from accessing student data.\nIn compliance with section 16 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 312.4(c)(2) of COPPA, Proctorio will notify parents when it learns that it has collected any personal information of a child under 13 years of age.</p>\n<p>For questions or complaints about COPPA compliance, please contact iKeepSafe at: COPPAPrivacy@ikeepsafe.org.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-02-03 13:37:28.286299", "updated_at": "2021-02-03

Encryption\n<p>\nProctorio utilizes <strong>zero-knowledge encryption</strong>, which means we have zero access to the encrypted data on our own servers.\nThis unique design allows nothing to leave

system.\n</p> Daily Vulnerability Tests\n<p>\nOur platform goes through daily vulnerability and penetration tests to assess the strength of our systems against a potential attack.\nPartnered institutions can see these daily vulnerability scans under an NDA.\nThis creates a security system you can trust.\n</p> A Friendly Reminder\n<p>\nProctorio never requires test-takers to provide additional personal information (PII) to access an exam.\nStudents simply sign in their LMS with their institution\u2019s credentials and access their assessment.\nFor third party platforms, a unique passcode is generated and managed by Proctorio, so that the students can access the exam effortlessly even when taking the exam outside of their LMS and/ or testing platform.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe exam data
