Dapper Labs Inc.\n(\u201cDapper\u201d), CryptoKitties allows players to breed their cats to create their very own furry friends.</p>\n<p>Dapper is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.\nThis Privacy Policy (this \u201cPolicy\u201d) sets out how we collect and process personal information about you when you visit our website at www.cryptokitties.co, when you use our mobile dapp, when you play our game (our \u201cGame\u201d), or when you otherwise do business or make contact with us.</p>\n<p>1.\nWhat information do we collect?</p>\n<p>A.\nSUMMARY</p>\n<p>Dapper collects data to enable us to operate the Game effectively, and to provide you with the best experiences on our website and our Game.\nYou provide some of this data to us directly, such as when you register to use our Game, subscribe to a newsletter, respond to a survey, make an enquiry through our website, contact us for support, or contact us as a prospective user, vendor, supplier, or consultant.\nWe get some of your data by recording how you interact with our website and our Game by, for example, using technologies like cookies.\nWe also obtain and process data in the context of making the Game available to you.</p>\n<p>B.\nLEARN MORE</p>\n<p>You have choices about the data we collect.\nWhen you are asked to provide personal data, you may decline.\nBut if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to enable us to make the Game available to you, you may not be able to sign up for or play the Game.\nThe data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Dapper, and the choices you make (including your privacy settings).\nThe data we collect can include the following:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Email and Metamask Wallet Address.</b> We may collect your email address and your Metamask wallet address.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Device and Usage information.</b> We may collect data about your device and how you and your device interact with Dapper and our Game.\nFor example, we may

advertising.</p>\n<p>B.\nLEARN MORE</p>\n<p>\n<b>Providing and improving our Game.</b> We use data to provide the Game to you, to improve the Game, and to perform essential business operations.\nThis includes operating the Game, maintaining and improving the performance of the Game, developing new features, conducting research, and providing customer support.\nExamples of such uses include the following:</p>\n<p>\n<b>Providing the Game.</b> We use data to carry out your transactions with us and to make the Game available to you.\nIn certain cases, the Game may include personalized features and recommendations to enhance your enjoyment, and automatically tailor your experience based on the data we have about you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Technical support.</b> We use data to diagnose problems, and to provide customer care and other support services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Improving the Game.</b> We use data to continually improve our website and our Game, including system administration, system security, and adding new features or capabilities.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Business Operations.</b> We use data to develop aggregate analyses and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Promotions.</b> We may use your data to administer contests, promotions, surveys, or other site features.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Improving

example, we may contact you to discuss your account, to remind you about features of the Game that are available for your use, to update you about a support request, or to invite you to participate in a survey.\nAdditionally, you can sign up for email subscriptions, and choose whether you want to receive marketing communications from us.\n</p>\n<p>3.\nHow do we protect your information?</p>\n<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.\nWe offer the use of a secure server.\nAll supplied sensitive information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.</p>\n<p>4.\nHow do we ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available?</p>\n<p>A.\nSUMMARY</p>\n<p>We implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing systems remain confidential, resilient, and available.\nSpecifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high availability, business continuity, and prompt disaster recovery.\nWe commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls, and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>B.\nLEARN MORE</p>\n<p>\n<b>High Availability.</b> Every part of the Game utilizes properly-provisioned, redundant servers (e.g., multiple load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of failure.\nWe take servers out of operation as part of regular maintenance, without impacting availability.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Business Continuity.</b> We keep encrypted backups of data daily in multiple regions on Google Cloud Platform.\nWhile never expected, in the case of production data loss (i.e., primary data stores loss), we will restore organizational data from these backups.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Disaster Recovery.</b> In the event of a region-wide outage, we will bring up a duplicate environment in a different Google Cloud Platform region.\nOur operations team has extensive experience performing full region migrations.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Physical Access Controls.</b> CryptoKitties is hosted on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.\nGoogle data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics.\nAccording to the Google Security Whitepaper: \u201cThe data center floor features laser beam intrusion detection.\nData centers are monitored 24/7 by high-resolution interior and exterior cameras that can detect and track intruders.\nAccess logs, activity records, and camera footage are reviewed in case an incident occurs.\nData centers are also routinely patrolled by professional security guards who have undergone rigorous background checks and training.\u201d AWS data centers feature a layered security model, including extensive safeguards such as custom-designed electronic access cards, alarms, vehicle access barriers, perimeter fencing, metal detectors, and biometrics.\nAccording to the AWS Security Whitepaper: \u201cAWS\u2019s data centers are state of the art, utilizing innovative architectural and engineering approaches.\nAmazon has many years of experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers.\nThis experience has been applied to the AWS platform and infrastructure.\nAWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities.\nPhysical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means.\nAuthorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors.\nAll visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.\u201d Dapper employees do not have physical access to Google or AWS data centers, servers, network equipment, or storage.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Logical Access Controls.</b> Dapper is the assigned administrator of its infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform, and only designated authorized Dapper operations team members have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis behind a two-factor authenticated virtual private network.\nSpecific private keys are required for individual servers, and keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Penetration Testing.</b> We engage an independent, third-party agency to perform black box penetration testing on an annual basis.\nInformation about security vulnerabilities that are successfully exploited through penetration testing is then used to set mitigation and remediation priorities.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Intrusion Detection and Prevention.</b> Unusual network patterns or suspicious behavior are among Dapper\u2019s biggest concerns for infrastructure hosting and management.\nGoogle Cloud Platform\u2019s intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) rely on both signature-based and algorithm-based security to help identify traffic patterns that are similar to known attack methods.\nIDS/IPS involves tightly controlling the size and make-up of the attack surface, employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points, and developing and deploying technologies that automatically remedy dangerous situations, as well as preventing known threats from accessing the system in the first place.\nWe do not provide direct access to security event forensics, but we do provide access to our engineering and customer support teams during and after any unscheduled downtime.\n</p>\n<p>5.\nDo we use cookies?</p>\n<p>A.\nSUMMARY</p>\n<p>Yes.\nCookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser

Retention</p>\n<p>A.\nSUMMARY</p>\n<p>We may retain your personal information as long as you continue to use the Game, have an account with us, or for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy.\nYou can ask to close your account by contacting us as described above, and we will delete your personal information on request.\nWe may, however, retain personal information for an additional period as is permitted or required under applicable laws, for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes.</p>\n<p>B.\nLEARN MORE</p>\n<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to make the Game available to you, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.\nBecause these needs can vary for different types of data, actual retention periods can vary significantly.\nThe criteria we use to determine the retention periods include:</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>How long is the personal data needed to make the Game available to you and/or operate our business? This includes such things such as maintaining and improving the performance of the Game, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records.\nThis is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>Is there an automated control, such as in your user dashboard, that enables you to access and delete the personal data at any time? If there is not, a shortened data retention time will generally be adopted.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>Is the personal data of a sensitive type? If so, a shortened retention time would generally be appropriate.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain the data in accordance with your consent.</li>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<li>Is Dapper subject to a legal, contractual, or similar obligation to retain the data? Examples can include mandatory data retention laws in the applicable jurisdiction, government orders to preserve data relevant to an investigation, or data that must be retained for the purposes of

is a distributed application that runs on the Ethereum network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a \u201cSmart Contract\u201d) to enable users to own, transfer, and breed genetically unique digital cats, which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the \u201cSite\u201d).\nThe Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the \u201cApp\u201d.\nUsing the App, users can view their cats and use the Smart Contracts to acquire, trade, and breed cats with other App users via clock auction.</p>\n<p>Dapper Labs Inc.\n(\"Dapper\", \"we\", or \"us\") is making the App available to you.\nBefore you use the App, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these \"Terms\").\nPLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.\nTHESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE.\nWE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE

ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS.\nIF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY\u2019S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE \u201cYOU\u201d WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY.\nIF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU.\nIF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.</p>\n<p>1.\nTHE APP</p>\n<p>A.\nTo most easily use the App, you may first install a web browser (such as the Google Chrome web browser) and an electronic wallet compatible with the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard on the Ethereum network, such as the MetaMask electronic wallet.\nMetaMask and other electronic wallets allow you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are

through MetaMask, or other Ethereum-compatible browsers.</p>\n<p>B.\nTransactions that take place on the App are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain.\nYou understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the App.</p>\n<p>C.\nWe neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App.\nWe will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.</p>\n<p>D.\nYou must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the App.\nBy creating an account, you agree to provide accurate, current and complete account information about yourself, and to maintain and promptly update as necessary your account information.\nYou are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts).\nIf you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at meow@cryptokitties.co.</p>\n<p>2.\nTHE KITTIES</p>\n<p>A.\nWe have utilized Smart Contracts to develop our initial generation of CryptoKitties (\u201cGen-Zero cats\u201d).\nWe will release a certain number of Gen-Zero cats \u201cinto the wild\u201d (and make them available for purchase) on the day we first launch the App.\nWe will then release an additional Gen-Zero cat into the wild every fifteen minutes, and we will make each newly-released Gen-Zero cat available for purchase via a zero-reserve clock auction.\nOur Smart Contracts enforce a hard limit of 50,000 Gen-Zero cats.</p>\n<p>B.\nAs users breed their CryptoKitties, new and unforeseen generations of CryptoKitties will come into existence! Using our proprietary genetic combination algorithm that we have designed as part of the App, each newly-bred CryptoKitty will have some of the genetic traits of its parents.\nAt the same time, other, new genetic traits may be expressed.\nUnique and surprising traits may be expressed when CryptoKitties are bred in the right combinations.\nThe Smart Contracts have total control over the pseudo-random elements of our breeding process, which means that we cannot manipulate or influence them.</p>\n<p>C.\nHow you breed your CryptoKitties is entirely up to you.\nYou may breed your own CryptoKitties with one another, or offer to breed your CryptoKitties with other users\u2019 CryptoKitties.\nCryptoKitties have no fixed gender, which means that in any particular breeding transaction, the CryptoKitties\u2019 owners can choose which cat will be the sire, and which will be the matron.\nWhen the new kitten is born, it will always be assigned to the owner of the matron cat.\nThe breeding of two CryptoKitties will always produce a kitten.</p>\n<p>3.\nOWNERSHIP.\nLICENSE.\nRESTRICTIONS</p>\n<p>A.\nDefinitions.\nFor the purposes of this Section 3, the following capitalized terms will have the following meanings:</p>\n<p>\u201cArt\u201d means any art, design, and drawings that may be associated with a CryptoKitty that you Own.</p>\n<p>\u201cExtensions\u201d means third party designs that: (i) are intended for use as extensions or overlays to the Art, (ii) do not modify the underlying Art, and (iii) can be removed at any time without affecting the underlying Art.</p>\n<p>\u201cOwn\u201d means, with respect to a CryptoKitty, a CryptoKitty that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully acquired from a legitimate source, where proof of such purchase is recorded on the relevant blockchain.</p>\n<p>\u201cPurchased Kitty\u201d means a Kitty that you Own.</p>\n<p>\u201cThird Party IP\u201d means any third party patent rights (including, without limitation, patent applications and disclosures), copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, know-how or any other intellectual property rights recognized in any country or jurisdiction in the world.</p>\n<p>B.\nOwnership</p>\n<p>i.\nYou Own the NFT.\nEach CryptoKitty is a non-fungible token (an \u201cNFT\u201d) on the Ethereum blockchain.\nWhen you purchase a CryptoKitty, you own the underlying NFT completely.\nThis means that you have the right to trade your NFT, sell it, or give it away.\nOwnership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any CryptoKitty.</p>\n<p>ii.\nDapper Owns the App.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Dapper (or, as applicable, our licensors) owns all legal right, title and interest in and to all other elements of the App, and all intellectual property rights therein (including, without limitation, all Art, designs, systems, methods, information, computer code, software, services, \u201clook and feel\u201d, organization, compilation of the content, code, data, and all other elements of the App (collectively, the \u201cDapper Materials\u201d)).\nYou acknowledge that the Dapper Materials are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights, and applicable laws.\nAll Dapper Materials are the copyrighted property of Dapper or its licensors, and all trademarks, service marks, and trade names associated with the App or otherwise contained in the Dapper Materials are proprietary to Dapper or its licensors.\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, your use of the App does not grant you ownership of or any other rights with respect to any content, code, data, or other Dapper Materials that you may access on or through the App.\nWe reserve all rights in and to the Dapper Materials that are not expressly granted to you in these Terms.\nFor the sake of clarity, you understand and agree: (a) that your purchase of a CryptoKitty, whether via the App or otherwise, does not give you any rights or licenses in or to the Dapper Materials (including, without limitation, our copyright in and to the associated Art) other than those expressly contained in these Terms.\n(b) that you do not have the right, except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercialize any elements of the Dapper Materials (including, without limitation, any Art) without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold in our sole and absolute discretion.\nand (c) that you will not apply for, register, or otherwise use or attempt to use any Dapper trademarks or service marks, or any confusingly similar marks, anywhere in the world without our prior written consent in each case, which consent we may withhold at our sole and absolute discretion.</p>\n<p>C.\nLicense to Art</p>\n<p>i.\nGeneral Use.\nSubject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Dapper grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased Kitties, along with any Extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use.\n(ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Purchased Kitty, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Kitty owner\u2019s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art.\nor (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Purchased Kitty, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Kitty owner\u2019s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Kitty leaves the website/application.</p>\n<p>ii.\nCommercial Use.\nSubject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Dapper grants you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased Kitty for the purpose of commercializing your own merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Kitty (\u201cCommercial Use\u201d), provided that such Commercial Use does not result in you earning more than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in gross revenue each year.\nFor the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of CryptoKitties generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Kitty owner\u2019s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art.\n(ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of CryptoKitties generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Kitty owner\u2019s rights to display the Art for their Purchased Kitty to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Kitty leaves the website/application.\nor (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing, even where such revenue is in excess of $100,000 per year.</p>\n<p>D.\nRestrictions.\nYou agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without Dapper\u2019s express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased Kitty in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes (your use of Extensions will not constitute a prohibited modification hereunder).\n(ii) use the Art for your Purchased Kitty to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service.\n(iii) use the Art for your Purchased Kitty in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others.\n(iv) use the Art for your Purchased Kitty in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use.\n(v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased Kitty, except as expressly permitted in these Terms.\n(vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased Kitty.\nor (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased Kitty for your or any third party\u2019s commercial benefit.\nTo the extent that Art associated with your Purchased Kitty contains Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from a celebrity, athlete, or other public figure), you understand and agree as follows: (w) that you will not have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Art, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein.\n(x) that the Commercial Use license in Section 3.C(ii) above will not apply.\n(y) that, depending on the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, Dapper may need to pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Art.\nand (z) to the extent that Dapper informs you of such additional restrictions in writing (email is permissible), you will be responsible for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure to do so will be deemed a breach of this license.\nThe restrictions in this Section will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.</p>\n<p>E.\nOther Terms of License.\nThe license granted in Section 3.C above applies only to the extent that you continue to Own the applicable Purchased Kitty.\nIf at any time you sell, trade, donate, give away, transfer, or otherwise dispose of your Purchased Kitty for any reason, the license granted in Section 3.C will immediately expire with respect to that Kitty without the requirement of notice, and you will have no further rights in or to the Art for that Kitty.\nIf you exceed the $100,000 limitation on annual gross revenue set forth in Section 3.C(ii) above, you will be in breach of these Terms, and must send an email to Dapper at legal@dapperlabs.com within forty-five (45) days, with the phrase \u201cCryptoKitty License - Commercial Use\u201d in the subject line, requesting a discussion with Dapper regarding entering into a broader license agreement or obtaining an exemption (which may be granted or withheld in Dapper\u2019s sole and absolute discretion).\nIf you exceed the scope of the license grant in Section 3.C(ii) without entering into a broader license agreement with or obtaining an exemption from Dapper, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) you are in breach of these Terms.\n(ii) in addition to any remedies that may be available to Dapper at law or in equity, Dapper may immediately terminate the license that was granted to you in Section 3.C, without the requirement of notice.\nand (iii) you will be responsible to reimburse Dapper for any costs and expenses incurred by Dapper during the course of enforcing these Terms against you.</p>\n<p>F.\nFeedback.\nYou may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the App, including without limitation about how to improve the App (collectively, \u201cFeedback\u201d).\nBy submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise).\nYou hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide license under all rights necessary for us to incorporate and use your Feedback for any purpose.</p>\n<p>G.\nYour Obligations.\nYou agree that you are responsible for your own conduct while accessing or using the App, and for any consequences thereof.\nYou agree to use the App only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations.\nBy way of example, and not as a limitation, you may not, and may not allow any third party to: (i) send, upload, distribute or disseminate any unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, obscene, or otherwise objectionable content.\n(ii) distribute viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature.\n(iii) impersonate another person (via the use of an email address or otherwise).\n(iv) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the App any content that infringes the intellectual proprietary rights of any party.\n(v) use the App to violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others.\n(vi) engage in, promote, or encourage illegal activity (including, without limitation, money laundering).\n(vii) interfere with other users' enjoyment of the App.\n(viii) exploit the App for any unauthorized commercial purpose.\n(ix) modify, adapt, translate, or reverse engineer any portion of the App.\n(x) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the App or any part of it.\n(xi) reformat or frame any portion of the App.\n(xii) display any

other applicable laws, or any third party rights.\n(xiii) use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other device to retrieve or index any portion of the App or the content posted on the App, or to collect information about its users for any unauthorized purpose.\n(xiv) create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses.\nor (xv) access or use the App for the purpose of creating a product or service that is competitive with any of our products or services.\nIf you engage in any of the activities prohibited by this Section, we may, at our sole and absolute discretion, without notice to you, and without limiting any of our other rights or remedies at law or in equity, immediately suspend or terminate your user account and/or delete your CryptoKitties\u2019 images and descriptions from the App and the Site.\nIf we delete your CryptoKitties\u2019 images and descriptions from the App and/or the Site, such deletion will not affect your ownership rights in any NFTs that you already Own.</p>\n<p>4.\nFEES AND PAYMENT</p>\n<p>A.\nIf you elect to purchase, trade, or breed CryptoKitties on the App, or with or from other users via the App, any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network.\nWe will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions.\nWith that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the App, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network.</p>\n<p>B.\nEthereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a \u201cGas Fee\u201d) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network.\nThe Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network.\nThis means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App.</p>\n<p>C.\nIn addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize the CryptoKitties marketplace Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 3.75% of the total value of that transaction (each, a \u201cCommission\u201d).\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network as part of your payment.\nWe will not collect a Commission for interactions that do not involve our marketplace.</p>\n<p>D.\nAs between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, \u201cTaxes\u201d) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or breeding of any of your CryptoKitties).\nExcept for income taxes levied on Dapper, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction.\nand (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.\nYou confirm that you are not a resident in Canada nor are you registered for Goods and services tax / Harmonized sales tax (GST / HST) or Provincial sales taxes (PST) in Canada, and will inform Dapper if your status changes in the future.</p>\n<p>5.\nTERMINATION</p>\n<p>You may terminate these Terms at any time by canceling your account on the App and discontinuing your access to and use of the App.\nYou will not receive any refunds if you cancel your account, or otherwise terminate these Terms.\nYou agree that we, in our sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate these Terms and suspend and/or terminate your account(s) for the App.\nYou agree that any suspension or termination of your access to the App may be without prior notice, and that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any such suspension or termination.\nIf we terminate these Terms or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the App due to your breach of these Terms or any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity, then termination of these Terms will be in addition to any other remedies we may have at law or in equity.\nUpon any termination or expiration of these Terms, whether by you or us, you may no longer have access to information that you have posted on the App or that is related to your account, and you acknowledge that we will have no obligation to maintain any such information in our databases or to forward any such information to you or to any third party.\nSections 1.C and 3 through 16 will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms for any reason.</p>\n<p>6.\nDISCLAIMERS</p>\n<p>A.\nYOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE APP IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK, AND THAT THE APP IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND \"AS AVAILABLE\" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES REGARDING THE APP AND ANY PART OF IT

(III) THE APP OR ANY CONTENT, SERVICES, OR FEATURES MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE APP ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR (IV) THAT ANY DATA THAT YOU DISCLOSE WHEN YOU USE THE APP WILL BE SECURE.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>B.\nYOU ACCEPT THE INHERENT SECURITY RISKS OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND DEALING ONLINE OVER THE INTERNET, AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY UNLESS IT IS DUE TO OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE.</p>\n<p>C.\nWE WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSSES YOU INCUR AS THE RESULT OF YOUR USE OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOSSES, DAMAGES OR CLAIMS ARISING FROM: (i) USER ERROR, SUCH AS FORGOTTEN PASSWORDS OR INCORRECTLY CONSTRUED SMART CONTRACTS OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS.\n(ii) SERVER FAILURE OR DATA LOSS.\n(iii) CORRUPTED WALLET FILES.\nOR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR ACTIVITIES BY THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF VIRUSES, PHISHING, BRUTEFORCING OR OTHER MEANS OF ATTACK AGAINST THE APP, ETHEREUM NETWORK, OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET.</p>\n<p>D.\nCRYPTOKITTIES ARE INTANGIBLE DIGITAL ASSETS THAT EXIST ONLY BY VIRTUE OF THE OWNERSHIP RECORD MAINTAINED IN THE ETHEREUM NETWORK.\nALL SMART CONTRACTS ARE CONDUCTED AND OCCUR ON THE DECENTRALIZED LEDGER WITHIN THE ETHEREUM PLATFORM.\nWE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER AND MAKE NO GUARANTEES OR PROMISES WITH RESPECT TO SMART CONTRACTS.</p>\n<p>E.\nDAPPER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR LOSSES DUE TO BLOCKCHAINS OR ANY OTHER FEATURES OF THE ETHEREUM NETWORK OR THE METAMASK ELECTRONIC WALLET, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LATE REPORT BY DEVELOPERS OR REPRESENTATIVES (OR NO REPORT AT ALL) OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN SUPPORTING THE ETHEREUM NETWORK, INCLUDING FORKS, TECHNICAL NODE ISSUES, OR ANY OTHER ISSUES HAVING FUND LOSSES AS A RESULT.</p>\n<p>7.\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>\n<p>A.\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR, HOWSOEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS OF PROFITS (WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY), LOSS OF GOODWILL OR BUSINESS REPUTATION, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n<p>B.\nYOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE APP, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THESE TERMS IN THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR (B) $100.</p>\n<p>C.\nYOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE HAVE MADE THE APP AVAILABLE TO YOU AND ENTERED INTO THESE TERMS IN RELIANCE UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US.\nWE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.</p>\n<p>D.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO LIMIT DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS.</p>\n<p>8.\nASSUMPTION OF RISK</p>\n<p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</p>\n<p>A.\nThe prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.\nFluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your CryptoKitties, which may also be subject to significant price volatility.\nWe cannot guarantee that any purchasers of CryptoKitties will not lose money.</p>\n<p>B.\nYou are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your CryptoKitties-related transactions.\nDapper is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts.</p>\n<p>C.\nThe App does not store, send, or receive CryptoKitties.\nThis is because CryptoKitties exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the App\u2019s supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network.\nAny transfer of CryptoKitties occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the App.</p>\n<p>D.\nThere are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet.\nYou accept and acknowledge that Dapper will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.</p>\n<p>E.\nA lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the CryptoKitties ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of CryptoKitties.</p>\n<p>F.\nThe regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the CryptoKitties ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of CryptoKitties.</p>\n<p>G.\nUpgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the ERC-20 standard, including the CryptoKitties ecosystem.</p>\n<p>9.\nINDEMNIFICATION</p>\n<p>You agree to hold harmless and indemnify Dapper and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees, advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys' fees arising out of or in any way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the App, or (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App.\nYou agree that Dapper will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.</p>\n<p>10.\nEXTERNAL SITES</p>\n<p>The App may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, \u201cExternal Sites\u201d), which are provided solely as a convenience to our users.\nWe have no control over any External Sites.\nYou acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites.\nFurthermore, you acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from, any External Sites.</p>\n<p>11.\nCHANGES TO THE TERMS</p>\n<p>We may make changes to the Terms from time to time.\nWhen we make changes, we will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the \u201cLast Updated\u201d date at the beginning of these Terms accordingly.\nPlease check these Terms periodically for changes.\nAny changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of the updates.\nIf you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.</p>\n<p>12.\nCHANGES TO THE APP</p>\n<p>We are constantly innovating the App to help provide the best possible experience.\nYou acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the App, and any part of it, may change from time to time without prior notice to you, and that we may add new features and change any part of the App at any time without notice.</p>\n<p>13.\nCHILDREN</p>\n<p>You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for children under 13.\nIF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS.\nYOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND ACCEPT THESE TERMS

us.</p>\n<p>All disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including without limitation your access or use of the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, or to any products sold or distributed through the App, the Site, or the Smart Contracts, will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the rules of the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre.\nThe appointing authority will be the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre.\nThe case will be adjudicated by a single arbitrator and will be administered by the British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre in accordance with its applicable rules.\nEach party will cover its own fees and costs associated with the arbitration proceedings.\nhowever, if the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the fees and costs reasonably associated with the arbitration proceedings, Dapper will pay them for you.\nThe place of arbitration will be Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions.\nThe language of the arbitration will be English.\nThe award of the arbitrator will be final and binding, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, Dapper may seek and obtain injunctive relief in any jurisdiction in any court of competent jurisdiction, and you agree that these Terms are specifically enforceable by Dapper through injunctive relief and other equitable remedies without proof of monetary damages.</p>\n<p>WITH RESPECT TO ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THE APP, THE SITE, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR ANY PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE APP, THE SITE, OR THE SMART CONTRACTS: (I) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY.\nAND (II) YOU HEREBY EXPRESSLY GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS IN ANY LAWSUIT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</p>\n<p>16.\nGeneral</p>\n<p>These Terms constitute the entire legal agreement between you and Dapper, govern your access to and use of the App, and completely replace any prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties related

affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger.\nShould any part of these Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.\nOur failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such provision, nor of the right to enforce such provision.\nThese Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles.\nSubject to Section 15, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or provincial courts located in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there.\nWe will not be liable for any failure or delayed performance of our obligations that
