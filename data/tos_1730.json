Ballotpedia, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general.\n</p>\nPublishing on Ballotpedia and public data\n<p>Simply visiting Ballotpedia does not expose your identity publicly (but see private logging below).\n</p>\nPrivate logging\n<p>Every time you visit a web page, you send a lot of information to the web server.\nMost web servers routinely maintain access logs with a portion of this information, which can be used to get an overall picture of what pages are popular, what other sites link to this one, and what web browsers people are using.\n</p>\n<p>These logs are used to produce the site statistics pages.\nthe raw log data is not made public, and is normally discarded after about two weeks.\n</p>\n<p>Here's a sample from Wikipedia--which uses the same logging system as Ballotpedia--of a log for one such page view: </p>\n64.164.82.142 - - [21/Oct/2003:02:03:19 +0000]\n\"GET /wiki/draft_privacy_policy HTTP/1.1\" 200 18084\n\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_projects:Village_pump\"\n\"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh.\nU.\nPPC Mac OS X.\nen-us) AppleWebKit/85.7 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/85.5\" <p>Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down badly-behaved web spiders that overwhelm the site.\nIP addresses of users, derived either from those logs or from records in the database are frequently used to correlate usernames and network addresses of edits in investigating abuse of the site, including the suspected use of malicious \"sockpuppets\" (duplicate accounts where one person logs into Ballotpedia under different names), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruption of the site.\n</p>\nPolicy on release of data derived from page logs\n<p>It is the policy of Ballotpedia that personally identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database via the CheckUser feature, may be released by the system administrators or users with CheckUser access, in the following situations:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li> In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement</li>\n<li> With permission of the affected user</li>\n<li> To the chair of the owner of Ballotpedia, his/her legal counsel, or his/her designee, when necessary for investigation of complaints</li>\n<li> Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues</li>\n<li> Where the user has been vandalising articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers</li>\n<li> Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Ballotpedia, its users or the public</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ballotpedia policy does not permit public distribution of such information under any circumstances, except as described above.\n</p>\nSharing information with third parties\n<p>Except where otherwise specified, all text added to Ballotpedia is available for reuse under the terms of the GFDL.\n</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia encourages you to sign up to receive its email updates and text message alerts.\nWhen you submit your email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses, that data will only be used by Ballotpedia.\nBallotpedia will not sell your information.\nIf you no longer want to receive communications from Ballotpedia or would like your information removed from the system, such requests will be honored within one business day.\n</p>\nAdvertising\n<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.\nThese companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.\nIf you prefer not to receive interest-based content, you can opt-out by clicking on the \u201cOpt Out\u201d link at either Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).\" </p>\nBallotpedia donors\n<p>Ballotpedia is committed to respecting the privacy of our donors.\n</p>\n<p>We collect and maintain the following types of donor information: contact information: name, complete address, phone number, email address.\npayment information: credit card number and expiration date, and billing information.\nand requests to receive updates: e.g., to individuals who request it, we will send periodic mailings and/or emails.\n</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia uses your information to complete a transaction, communicate back to you, and update you on Ballotpedia projects and news.\nCredit card numbers are used only for donation or payment processing and are not retained for other purposes.\n</p>\n<p>Ballotpedia will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to other organizations, and donors may opt out of having their private information shared in any fashion.\nUse of donor information will be limited to the internal purposes of Ballotpedia and will be kept secure.\n</p>\nBallotpedia staff\n<p>\n<i>The following information pertains to Ballotpedia paid staff, who have editing access to the site.</i>\n</p>\n<p>When you edit any page on
