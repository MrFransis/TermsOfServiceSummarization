version\nXtraMath Privacy PolicyIntroduction<p>XtraMath is committed to protecting data privacy.\nWe strictly adhere to this Privacy Policy, which explains what user data we collect and how we use it.\nThis policy and our\nTerms of Service\nare known collectively as our \u201cTerms.\u201d We may change these Terms from time to time, but will provide notice as specified in the Terms of Service document.</p>\n<p>\n<em>This policy is effective May 25, 2018, and replaces our prior privacy policy\n.</em>\n</p>Summary<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We collect the minimum amount of data required to operate our program.</li>\n<li>We use parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 Personal Data to operate our program and, with their permission, to contact them about the program.</li>\n<li>We use students\u2019 Personal Data only to operate our program.</li>\n<li>We use de-identified student data to improve our program.</li>\n<li>We protect student data and have signed the\nStudent Privacy Pledge.</li>\n<li>We do not advertise to students, sell their data, or profile them in any way.</li>\n<li>We comply with applicable data privacy laws, such as FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR.</li>\n<li>We never sell user data to third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>What Data We Collect<p>XtraMath collects the minimum amount of data required to operate our program.\nBelow we summarize the data we collect on students, teachers, and parents.\nFor an up-to-date list that shows what user data we collect, and how we use that data, see Appendix B,\nRecord of Data Processing.</p>Definitions<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Data</strong> includes all information connected with a person\u2019s or educational entity\u2019s use of XtraMath.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, Personal Data, metadata, usage and performance data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personal Data</strong> includes any data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual person.\nFor example: an email address is always considered Personal Data.\na student\u2019s grade level generally is not, but could be in conjunction with other information.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>School</strong> includes: individual schools.\nteachers acting on behalf of schools.\nschool districts.\nand other local educational entities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>Student Data<p>We collect a student\u2019s first name, grade level, and program settings from the student\u2019s parent or teacher.\nAs the student uses XtraMath, we collect usage and performance data, such as when they signed in, how many questions they answered correctly, and how long it took them to answer questions.\nIf a student signs in via a single sign-on provider, such as Google, we collect an identifier from the provider that allows us to authenticate their sign-in.\nWe do <strong>not</strong> collect the student email address that may be used for such a sign-in.</p>\n<p>Other personal information about the student could be inferred from data that we collect.\nIf a student account belongs to a class, for example, then we could infer that they attend a certain school.</p>Parent Data<p>We collect a parent\u2019s name and email address when they sign up for an account.\nIf they sign up using a single sign-on provider, we also collect an identifier that allows us to authenticate their sign-in.\nWe also collect some metadata and account settings, such as their time zone, the language they used to sign up, and their email preferences.</p>\n<p>A parent supplies a password when they create an account.\nThe password is hashed (scrambled) on the user\u2019s computer before it is ever sent to XtraMath.\nWe do not have access to a user\u2019s original password, and cannot obtain it from the hashed version that we receive.</p>\n<p>Other personal information about the parent could be inferred from data that we collect.\nFor example, we could infer that a parent whose account is linked to a student account is the parent or guardian of that student.</p>Teacher Data<p>We collect the same data for teacher accounts as parent accounts, with a few additions.\nFor example, we collect the name by which students address the teacher, such as \u201cMs.\nSmith.\u201d We also collect information about each class that the teacher creates, such as its name and its end date.</p>\n<p>Other personal information about the teacher could be inferred from data we collect.\nFor example, we could infer that the teacher works at a specific school based on their email address.</p>How We Use and Share Data<p>XtraMath processes user data in order to establish and maintain accounts, to provide educational activities to students, to compile and deliver reports about those activities to teachers and parents, and to understand and improve our program\u2019s effectiveness.\nFor an up-to-date list that shows the specific types of user data we collect, and how we use that data, see Appendix B,\nRecord of Data Processing.</p>Student Data<p>A student\u2019s Personal Data is used internally to provide the student with appropriate educational activities, and to report their performance to their parents and teachers.\nWe may access student Personal Data when providing customer support or investigating a reported issue with our program.</p>Parent and Teacher Data<p>A parent\u2019s or teacher\u2019s Personal Data is used internally for sign-in purposes and, with permission, to send them reports, announcements, and alerts related to XtraMath.\nWe may access a parent\u2019s or teacher\u2019s Personal Data when providing them with requested support.</p>Sharing Personal Data with Third Parties<p>We release Personal Data to third parties only in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>When the user requests the disclosure</em>, such as a teacher sharing their class with another teacher.</li>\n<li>\n<em>When the third party is a trusted service provider</em>, and the data is required to adequately perform the service.\nWe carefully vet our service providers and their security practices.\nFor details, see Appendix A,\nList of Third Party Providers.</li>\n<li>\n<em>When required by law or a court order.</em>\n</li>\n<li>\n<em>In the event of a joint venture, sale or merger with a third party.</em>\nThe third party would be required to uphold our Terms, including our Privacy Policy for all existing accounts.\nWe would provide advance notice before sharing data with that third party.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>XtraMath never releases Personal Data for any kind of third-party advertising.</p>Use of De-identified Data<p>We may use de-identified usage data internally to analyze and improve our educational services, and to develop new products or features.\nWe will never attempt to re-identify data that has been de-identified.</p>\n<p>We may release de-identified data to educational researchers for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of our program.\nWe will not release de-identified data unless we are confident it cannot be re-identified, due to the removal of all direct and indirect personal identifiers, and the educational researchers have agreed in writing that they will not attempt to re-identify any individuals, classes, or Schools.</p>\n<p>We may use aggregate de-identified data, such as the number of users of our service, for promotional purposes.</p>How We Securely Store Data<p>XtraMath takes security seriously.\nWe implement a variety of industry-standard security measures to prevent any unauthorized access to our users\u2019 data.\nSuch measures include, but are not limited to: data minimization.\nencrypting data in transit via HTTPS.\nhashing sensitive data, like passwords.\ndeletion of outdated data.\nlocked physical facilities.\nemployee training.\nand administrator account security.</p>Data Storage and International Transfer<p>XtraMath stores and processes all data on servers in the United States.\nAll servers that store XtraMath data are operated by trusted third party processors with whom we have contractual Data Processing Addendums.\nOur providers are certified under the\nEU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, to better protect the data of our international users.\nFor details, see Appendix A,\nList of Third Party Providers.</p>Data Breach Response<p>While we use industry-standard practices to safeguard data, no service can guarantee absolute data security.\nWe have a Breach Response Plan, which we will follow if we ever discover that Personal Data has been accessed improperly.\nAs part of our response, we will: take action to stop further data loss or unauthorized access.\ninvestigate how the breach occurred.\npromptly contact all affected users via email.\nand contact law enforcement and government agencies when appropriate.</p>Data Retention and Deletion<p>XtraMath retains Personal Data only for as long as necessary to ensure continuity of math skill-building for students, and for the convenience of parents and teachers.\nWe close user accounts, and delete all associated identifiable data, upon request.\nMost types of data are also deleted automatically after a certain amount of time has passed.\nFor details, see Appendix B,\nRecord of Data Processing.</p>\n<p>We may retain de-identified, aggregate data, which cannot identify any individual user, for research and program improvement purposes.\nSuch data is deleted once no longer necessary for these purposes.</p>\n<p>We will provide certification of data deletion upon request.</p>Compliance with Data Privacy Laws<p>XtraMath intends to comply with the data privacy and data protection laws of all jurisdictions where it operates.\nSee the <em>XtraMath and Student Data Privacy</em> whitepaper for the latest information on compliance.\nSome specific examples of legislation that we comply with are described below.</p>United States<p>\n<strong>Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</strong>\nAs a non-profit organization, XtraMath is not subject to\nCOPPA.\nNevertheless, we fully comply with the law as if we were subject to it.\nChildren under the age of 13 may not create accounts.\nWe only collect usage and performance data from students as a result of their performing educational activities, and we only use that data for educational purposes.\nIf we gain actual knowledge that a child is using XtraMath without the appropriate consent, we terminate the account.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Family Education Rights Protection Act (FERPA):</strong>\nSchools in the United States may provide student data to XtraMath while complying with\nFERPA.\nWhen a School provides us with a student\u2019s Personal Data (or PII \u2014 Personally Identifiable Information) under the FERPA school official exemption, they remain in control of that data.\nXtraMath will only use and disclose that data as specified in our Terms and as allowed by law.</p>International<p>\n<strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):</strong>\nXtraMath affirms and respects all data subject's rights under\nGDPR.\nWe minimize the data we collect and process, and use data only as described in this policy.\nFor detailed information about what data we process, for what purpose, for how long, and our basis for doing so under the GDPR, see Appendix B,\nRecord of Data Processing.\nTo object to processing, or to request data deletion or access, contact our Data Protection Officer at privacy@xtramath.org.</p>Cookies and Local Storage<p>\n<em>XtraMath intends to discontinue the use of cookies by August 1, 2018.</em>\n</p>\n<p>XtraMath uses two types of cookies.\nThese cookies can be cleared via browser settings \u2014\naboutcookies.org\nprovides cookie management instructions for many specific browsers.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Google Analytics</strong>\ncookies allow us to see data such as the number of site visitors we get, and which pages they visit the most.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Vimeo</strong>\ncookies are stored when users play the videos on our homepage, and primarily keep track of the video player settings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>The XtraMath website uses \u201cLocalStorage\u201d files to remember a user\u2019s sign-in information (if they choose to do so).\nWe also use \u201cSessionStorage\u201d to improve performance during student activities by temporarily storing activity data on the device.\nUse of LocalStorage and SessionStorage is not required to use XtraMath.\nUsers can remove remembered sign-in information at any time via the appropriate sign-in page.\nUsers can also clear all LocalStorage by using the \u201cClear now\u201d button on our\nsupport page, or via browser settings.</p>\n<p>The XtraMath mobile apps use application data for the same purposes as browser LocalStorage and SessionStorage.\nUsers can still remove remembered sign-in information via the app\u2019s sign-in pages.\nUninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data.\nSome devices also allow users to clear locally stored app data without uninstalling the app.</p>Contact Us<p>For data privacy questions or concerns, to object to processing, or to request access to or deletion of your or your child\u2019s Personal Data, email us at
