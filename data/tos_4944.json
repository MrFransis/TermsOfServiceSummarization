you to access and use the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to ensure payment in advance for all paid aspects of the Service, and to ensure that your credit or debit cards or other payment instruments accepted by Manticore or an applicable Payment Service Provider continue to be valid and sufficient for such purposes.\nWithout limiting any other rights or remedies of Manticore, we may exercise our termination rights (as detailed below) in the event of any payment delinquency.\nManticore further reserves the right to terminate Usage Subscriptions for

not acquire ownership of any copies of the Content, or transfer of any copyright or other intellectual property rights in the Content.\nThis Core Content License is expressly conditioned upon you and each of your Accounts remaining active, in good standing, and in compliance with these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Manticore reserves the right, but is not obligated, to use technological measures designed to prohibit the copying, transfer, or distribution of Content outside the Service when we in good faith believe that such copying, transfer, or distribution would or might violate the

not agreeable to you.\nTo the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.\nYou understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it.\nIn connection with Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that you (a) own and have all necessary Intellectual Property Rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Manticore and users of the Service to use the Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms.\n(b) the User Content is accurate.\n(c) the User Content does not and, as to Manticore\u2019s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in this Agreement, will not infringe, violate, or

obligation to monitor or enforce your Intellectual Property Rights to your User Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at our cost and expense) to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint Manticore as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You grant Manticore certain licenses to your User Content.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise agreed to in a written agreement between you and Manticore that was signed by an authorized representative of Manticore, if you submit, transmit, display, perform, post, or store User Content using the Service, you grant Manticore and its sublicensees, to the furthest extent and for the maximum period permitted by applicable law (including in perpetuity if permitted under applicable law), an unrestricted, worldwide, irrevocable, fully sublicensable, non-exclusive, and royalty-free right to (a) use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish

that you have obtained the appropriate consents and/or licenses for your use of such features and that Manticore and its sub-licensees are allowed to use them to the extent indicated in these Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Manticore may, but will not have the obligation to, display, maintain, or otherwise make use of, any of your User Content, and Manticore may, in its sole discretion, modify, delete, or otherwise make use of User Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party.\nManticore reserves the right to treat User Content on the Service as content stored at the direction of users for which Manticore will not exercise control except to block or remove content that comes to Manticore\u2019s attention and is offensive, obscene, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable to Manticore, or to enforce the rights of third parties or the content restrictions set forth below, when notice of their violation comes to our attention.\nSuch User Content submitted by you or others need not, however, be maintained on the Service by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User Content on the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You grant certain licenses to other users by publicly sharing your User Content.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You

and/or record a video of the Content, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the resulting photograph, image, film, or video in any current or future media (the \u201cMedia License\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to grant users of the Service a User Content License or Media License, you agree that it is your obligation to avoid displaying or making available your Content to other users.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>You acknowledge that when you receive a User Content License, you receive only licensing and use rights.\ntherefore, you do not acquire ownership of any copies of the Content, or transfer of any copyright of Intellectual Property Rights in the Content.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may delete your User Content and terminate any related licenses, with limitations.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>With respect to any User Content you have submitted through the Service, the rights granted by you hereunder terminate once you delete such User Content from the Service, except (a) to the extent you shared it as part of the Service.\n(b) Manticore used it for promotional purposes, or (c) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.\nIn such circumstances, the licenses granted by you above shall terminate, but only for those particular copies or instances of Content that you have deleted from the Service.\nYou acknowledge that this termination will not apply to any other copies or instances of the same Content that you have not specifically deleted from the Service, including without limitation those that may be displayed elsewhere through the Service and those that may be in the Account inventories of other users to whom you transferred copies.\nYou acknowledge that the Media License granted to Manticore and other users with respect to your Content will survive any such termination.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UPLOAD CONTENT AT YOUR OWN RISK</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Manticore uses reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect User Content against unauthorized copying and distribution.\nHowever, Manticore does not guarantee that unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties will not occur.\nTo the furthest extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree that Manticore shall not be liable for any unauthorized copying, use, or distribution of User Content by third parties and release and forever waive any claims you may have against Manticore for such unauthorized copying or usage of such User Content, under any theory.\nTHE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT USER CONTENT USED BY MANTICORE HEREIN ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, ASSURANCES, OR OTHER TERMS THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE
