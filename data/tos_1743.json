page.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>When was QuestionCove Founded?</b>\n<p>QuestionCove was founded on June 27th, 2016 with the Beta site launching a few months after.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What are the rules?</b>\n<p>The Rules</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Asking Questions <br>\n<br>\n<b>How do I ask a question?</b>\n<p>At the top left of the page, there is a box that indicates \"Ask a question\"</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What are the guidelines for asking questions?</b>\n<p>Please try to keep your question education-focused.\nIf you would like to have a casual conversation please use the chat boxes at the bottom instead.\nAlso, please refrain from asking questions from graded quizzes or tests as this is a violation of our Anti-Cheating policy.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I posted a question but nobody has responded.\nWhat can I do?</b>\n<p>Your first step should be to make sure your question has everything necessary for someone to be able to answer your question.\nFor example, any relevant images, graphs, or data.\nThe next step would be to post a link to your question in the chat (never post the question itself).\nIf there is still no reply, tag users by posting @username on the question.\nEven if they may not be able to answer the question itself, they may know someone who can!</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What subject should I post my question in?</b>\n<p>Please try to find the most appropriate subject for your question.\nIf you are in doubt please tag a moderator, explain the content of your question, and we will suggest a subject for you to post in.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I accidentally posted my question in the wrong subject!</b>\n<p>No worries, you may tag a moderator and we will move it upon request.\nYou may also close your question and repost it in the appropriate subject.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I can't post a question</b>\n<p>Most likely you already have a question open in that subject.\nYou can have one question open per subject at one time, so if you already have an open question it must be closed before posting a new one.\nIf you are having trouble finding it, try switching to the subject the question is posted in, it should then appear in the \"Ask a Question\" box.\nIf you are still having trouble's you can contact a moderator and we will assist.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Answering Questions <br>\n<br>\n<b>What are the guidelines for answering questions?</b>\n<p>When answering a question, please try to stay on topic.\nAvoid giving the answer outright.\nplease provide an explanation and help guide the user through explanations instead.\nPlease avoid copy-pasting answers from other websites as this is plagiarism and reflects poorly on the site as a whole.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Is there a specific format I need to follow?</b>\n<p>Besides the general rule of not giving direct answers, you may format your answer however you wish.\nFor questions involving formulas or calculations, you may want to use LaTeX to make your work easier to read.\nIn general, try to make your work logical and easy to follow.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What if I don't know how to answer a question?</b>\n<p>Please try to avoid giving misleading information.\nIf you are unsure of how to answer a question, you may simply tell the asker you are unsure of how to solve the question.\nYou may try tagging another user if they are willing and able to help.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> SmartScores <br>\n<br>\n<b>What is a SmartScore?</b>\n<p>A SmartScore is a number assigned to each user.\nIt is meant to represent your activity and contributions towards the site.\nEach user starts off as level 0 and can reach a maximum of 100.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Is it possible to reach 100 SmartScore?</b>\n<p>Yes, however only one person can be 100 at a time, so you would have to pass them in points in order to become 100.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why is there only one level 100 user?</b>\n<p>The person with the highest overall SmartScore points is assigned 100SS.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How do I increase my SmartScore?</b>\n<p>By doing just about anything on the site.\nMost things will lead to your SmartScore going up, however depending on how productive it is usually measures how much you receive.\nNote: Certain behaviors such as medal-spamming, spamming the chat, and posting spam questions, are not acceptable ways to increase your SmartScore.\nIf you engage in these behaviors you are subject to being suspended and your SmartScore will be lowered accordingly.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Why do users sometimes appear out of order?</b>\n<p>Sometimes lower-SS users may appear above higher-SS users.\nThere are a few reasons for this: for one, it may be a glitch.\nIt usually happens when the server and client fall out of sync, so the server sends a user at a position that from the clients perspective is incorrect.\nHowever, it can also be because some users have had SmartScore points transferred from OpenStudy.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> StarCoins <br>\n<br>\n<b>What are StarCoins?</b>\n<p>StarCoins are currency that you can obtain by helping users in a subject.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What can I do with StarCoins?</b>\n<p>Currently, you can use StarCoins only to purchase group titles.\nGroup titles show how much you've helped in a subject.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Chat Boxes <br>\n<br>\n<b>Why are there chatboxes at the bottom of the page?</b>\n<p>That chat boxes allow students to also communicate in a non-curricular way.\nStudents may to talk to each other and get better acquainted.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>What are the rules regarding the chatboxes?</b>\n<p>Like other areas on the site, the chatbox is subject to our rules.\nAll forms of media posted there are subject to our rules regarding foul language and other inappropriate content.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How do I insert files into the chat?</b>\n<p>For images, [img]URL[/img].\nYou can also drag the image file to the chatbox, or copy+paste it from the browser.\nDrag+drop also works for audio files, or alternatively [audio]URL[/audio].</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How many chatboxes are there?</b>\n<p>By default there are two chats: an \"All Subjects\" chat and a \"Mathematics\" chat.\nSubscribers can create their own custom group chats and can invite other users to join them.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I am a subscriber.\nHow do I add someone to my chat?</b>\n<p>If you go to the menu, you will see a button called \"Group Chat\", there you will be able to add/remove users, change the chat's name, add emojis, or even customize the look of it.\nHowever, we recommend asking users if they would like to be added before adding them.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>I would like to like to leave a chat.\nHow do I do that?</b>\n<p>Press the x at the top right of the chat box.\nBy default you cannot exit the All Subjects and Mathematics chat.\nHowever, you may press the yin/yang button at the top right to hide the chat.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br> Moderation <br>\n<br>\n<b>What are moderators?</b>\n<p>Moderators are users who help supervise the site.\nThey have various responsibilities around the site, such as
