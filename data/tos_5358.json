about the technologies that help Royal Road to achieve the purposes described below.\nSuch technologies allow the Owner to access and store information (for example by using a Cookie) or use resources (for example by running a script) on a User\u2019s device as they interact with Royal Road.\n</p>\n<p> For simplicity, all such technologies are defined as \"Trackers\" within this document \u2013 unless there is a reason to differentiate.<br> For example, while Cookies can be used on both web and mobile browsers, it would be inaccurate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile apps as they are a browser-based Tracker.\nFor this reason, within this document, the term Cookies is only used where it is specifically meant to indicate that particular type of Tracker.\n</p>\n<p>Some of the purposes for which Trackers are used may also require the User's consent.\nWhenever consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions provided in this document.</p>\n<p>Royal Road uses Trackers managed directly by the Owner (so-called \u201cfirst-party\u201d Trackers) and Trackers that enable services provided by a third-party (so-called \u201cthird-party\u201d Trackers).\nUnless otherwise specified within this document, third-party providers may access the Trackers managed by them.<br>\nThe validity and expiration periods of Cookies

consent\n<p>There are various ways to manage Tracker related preferences and to provide and withdraw consent, where relevant:</p>\n<p>Users can manage preferences related to Trackers from directly within their own device settings, for example, by preventing the use or storage of Trackers.</p>\n<p>Additionally, whenever the use of Trackers is based on consent, Users can provide or withdraw such consent by setting their preferences within the cookie notice or by updating such preferences accordingly via the relevant consent-preferences widget, if available.</p>\n<p>It is also possible, via relevant browser or device features, to delete previously stored Trackers, including those used to remember the User\u2019s initial consent.</p>\n<p>Other Trackers in the browser\u2019s local memory may be cleared by deleting the browsing history.</p>\n<p>With regard to any third-party Trackers, Users can manage their preferences and withdraw their consent via the related opt-out link (where provided), by using the means indicated in the third party's privacy policy, or by contacting the third party.</p> Locating Tracker Settings\n<p>Users can, for example, find information about how to manage Cookies in the most commonly used browsers at the following addresses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Chrome</li>\n<li>Mozilla Firefox</li>\n<li>Apple Safari</li>\n<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer</li>\n<li>Microsoft Edge</li>\n<li>Brave</li>\n<li>Opera</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Users may also manage certain categories of Trackers used on mobile apps by opting out through relevant device settings such as the device advertising settings for mobile devices, or tracking settings in general (Users may open the device settings and look for the relevant setting).</p> How to opt out of interest-based advertising <p>Notwithstanding the above, Users may follow the instructions provided by YourOnlineChoices (EU), the Network Advertising Initiative (US) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (US), DAAC (Canada), DDAI (Japan) or other similar services.\nSuch initiatives allow Users to select their tracking preferences for most of the advertising tools.\nThe Owner thus recommends that Users make use of these resources in addition to the information provided in this document.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance offers an application called AppChoices that helps Users to control interest-based advertising on mobile apps.\n</p> Owner and Data Controller <p>6094/7\n<br>Nazareth, Galilee 16040\n<br>Israel</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Owner contact email:</strong>
