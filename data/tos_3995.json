about how YouTube and Google process your Personal Data please see the Google Privacy Policy.\n</p> Advertising service providers <p> The Overwolf platform supports the display of ads within the Services and Third-Party apps.\nThis helps Third Party App Developers make a living off their creations, and continuously maintain high quality products that are free of charge.\nIt is up to the developer of the app to decide whether to include ads within the app or not.\nApp developers must comply with Overwolf\u2019s strict guidelines to ensure that ads never interfere with the gaming experience.\n</p>\n<p> The Overwolf platform also supports opting out of in-app ads, by providing app developers the option to integrate a paid subscription plan for their app.\nIt is up to the developer of the app to decide whether to include a subscription plan for the app or not.\n</p>\n<p> To facilitate the delivery of ads within the Services and Third Party Apps, Overwolf uses trusted and well known third-party advertising service providers.\nFor more information about the advertising service providers we work with, please see our Advertising service providers page.\n</p>\n<p> Advertising service providers may personalize the ads they deliver to make them more relevant to you.\nThis is based upon information they collect independently, and is stored in cookies by them.\nIn addition, to support personalization of in-app ads, Overwolf may provide limited information to advertising service providers when they deliver ads.\nThis information includes the name of the app where the ad is displayed, the last three games played on the computer, and some hardware information such as a description of the installed CPU, GPU and peripherals.\n</p>\n<p> Overwolf is currently in the process of developing the option to opt out of ad personalization.\nWe plan to have this option available by the end of December 2020.\n</p> Third Party App Developers <p> Third Party App Developers using our SDK or API will have access to their end users' data, including, but not limited to game data, device information, connected hardware, played games, captured media, etc.\nWe required the Third Party App Developers to use such data only to provide the SDK/API functionality within their applications and/or services.\n</p> Business Transfers <p> In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.\nIn these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets.\nMoreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if

information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public, and by posting it you provide your consent to its disclosure.\nYou should exercise caution when disclosing any information (including Personal Data) in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes.\n</p>\n<p> We use subcontractors and service providers and have business partners and affiliates who are located in countries other than your own, as set forth above and send them information we receive (including Personal Data).\nWe conduct such international transfers since we use trusted service providers located in different countries.\nWe will ensure that these third parties will be subject to written agreements ensuring the same level of privacy and data protection as set forth in this Privacy Notice, including appropriate remedies in the event of the violation of your data protection rights in such a third country.\n</p>\n<p> Whenever we transfer

EEA.\n</li>\n<li> Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they have been certified by the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to Personal Data shared between Europe and the US or any other arrangement which has been approved by the European Commission.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Please contact us the contact information listed below if
