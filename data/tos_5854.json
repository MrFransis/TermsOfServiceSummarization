Uses <p>We may use Personal Information obtained through the Services in the following ways: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>To provide the Services;</li>\n<li>To provide, analyze, administer, develop, and improve the Site or our Services;</li>\n<li> To contact you in connection with the Site, our Services, and notifications, services, programs or offerings for which you may have registered.\n</li>\n<li>To send you updates and promotional materials for which you have registered;</li>\n<li> To assess whether a clinical trial is suited for you, to contact you when a potential clinical trial is identified, and to bring you in contact with principal investigators, clinical research sites or clinical trial service providers, using solely for these purposes the health information that is provided to us based on your consent.\n</li>\n<li> To identify and authenticate your access to the parts of the Site and Services that you are authorized to access.\n</li>\n<li>For our legitimate interests of documenting and managing our internal administration;</li>\n<li> To protect the rights and/or our property and to ensure the technical functionality and security of the Site or Services.\nand </li>\n<li> To

investigative purposes.\nThis may include sharing the Personal Information with third parties, such as governmental authorities or law enforcement officials, subject to applicable law.\n</li>\n</ul> (2) Registered Users <p>If you register for our Services, SubjectWell uses algorithms that enforce criteria to select the clinical trial most suitable to you, which is the service that you (as the data subject) request from SubjectWell.\nThe decision on the clinical trial matching is therefore necessary for the performance of the contract between you and SubjectWell.\nFurthermore, our patient recruitment marketplace is voluntary and when you choose to participate and disclose your information to us, you also provide your explicit consent, which is freely given and can be withdrawn at any time by contacting us through the contact details further below.</p>\n<p>The logic that is used for the decision-making is created by SubjectWell employees reviewing study protocols that define inclusion/exclusion criteria for study eligibility.\nThe SubjectWell systems then enforce these criteria based on the responses collected during the phone screening process.\nThe most important consequences of the automated decisions in question is that you will or will not have the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial.</p>\n<p>In order to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, you have the right to obtain human intervention on the part of SubjectWell, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.</p>\n<p>Also note that we only provide clinical trial participant recruitment services and are not involved in clinical trials or informed about the results.\nTherefore, SubjectWell does not determine the purposes or means of the further processing of your Personal Information, including your health information, by principal investigators, clinical research sites or clinical trial service providers once you are brought in contact with them.</p> V.\nWHO DO WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH? <p>We may disclose Personal Information you provide to us or that we collect automatically on the Site or in and through the Services with the

operate our business or provide services on our behalf.\n</li>\n<li> If you would like to participate in a clinical trial and there are matching clinical trials, we may share Personal Information about you with principal investigators, clinical research sites, and clinical trial service providers that are relevant to you.\n</li>\n<li> Public authorities, such as law enforcement, if we are
