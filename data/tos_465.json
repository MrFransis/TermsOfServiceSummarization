in the internal working of Restream to make its services GDPR complaint.<br>\n<br>\n<b> Here is a summary of GDPR sections that are applicable to users of Restream services.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b> Cookies</b>\n<br>\n<br> GDPR only allows collection of user data for a legal reason.\nRestream only collects data for verification purposes as per the legal agreement signed by Restream and its customers in the Terms of Use.\nThis data will be limited to verification of the credentials, identity or any other related verification that was required by our customers to be provided as per the legal agreement.<br>\n<br>\n<b> Lawful Basis</b>\n<br>\n<br> GDPR only allows collection of user data for a legal reason.\nRestream only collects data for verification purposes as per the legal agreement signed by Restream and its customers in the Terms of Use.\nThis data will be limited to verification of the credentials, identity or any other related verification that was required by our

option for customers to go through our data protection, privacy policy and Terms &amp.\nConditions, to ensure full transparency.<br>\n<br>\n<b> Deletion</b>\n<br>\n<br> GDPR requires Restream to

login.\nThis can be deleted via their account settings or contacting a Customer Service Representative via chat or email.<br>\n<br>\n<b> Restream Plan for GDPR Compliance</b>\n<br>\n<br> Restream Users and Enterprise partners should feel confident that we are both knowledgeable and compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that are under our control.\nThis directive set by the European Union, a legislation that set forth guidelines regarding how information is collected and how it is processed and used.<br>\n<br> The GDPR legislation was formed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe.\nEmpowering all EU citizen\u2019s data privacy in the process, and to reshape how organizations approach data privacy in a secure and transparent manner.<br>\n<br> At Restream, we deploy commercially reasonable efforts to assist our users, businesses and our clients.\nTo help them understand, what the GDPR means for their businesses and to assist them in establishing a compliant process of their own.\nConsidering that aspect, we have made great improvements to our Restream platform to ensure that we stand at par with the critical components of GDPR measures.<br>\n<br>\n<b> The Restream Process:</b>\n<br>\n<br> Let us say that Daniel Streamer is a potential customer and lives in France.\nHe is called the Data Subject, and the service provider, is called the Controller of his data.\nSince Restream is verifying the credentials of Daniel, then that makes Restream, the Processor.<br>\n<br>\n<b> How Daniel might interact with Restream:</b>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Enterprise Ecommerce partner integrates Restream with their online business/portal/app</li>\n<li>Daniel approaches the Online Business and is redirected to a landing page where Restream Verification is carried out.</li>\n<li>Or Daniel goes directly to Restream.io and enters relevant credentials (email Address and password)</li>\n<li>Restream uses STRIPE for payment collections, so Restream does NOT retain any Credit or Debit card info.</li>\n<li>Restream does NOT collect Date of Birth, Physical Address, Social Security Numbers or other overly sensitive PII (Personal Identifiable Information).</li>\n<li>Based on the results of a verification of Daniels username and password only, he is<b> Verified</b> or<b> Not Verified</b> to use the Restream service.</li>\n</ul>\n<br> All the above stated steps gather user data from the<b> Data Subject</b> on behalf of<br>\n<b> Controller</b> that is passed on to<b> Processor.</b> Following are
