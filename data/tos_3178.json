RIGHTS.</b>\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Agreement to Arbitrate </b>This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d&nbsp.\nYou agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Foundation, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Platforms, any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify.&nbsp.\nFurther, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf.&nbsp.\nYou agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and Foundation are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.&nbsp.\nYour rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.&nbsp.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<i>\n<b>YOU AND FOUNDATION AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING.&nbsp.\nUNLESS BOTH YOU AND FOUNDATION AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.&nbsp.\nALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.</b>\n</i>\n<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Foundation is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by emailing customer support at <u>support@withfoundation.com</u>.&nbsp.\nIf such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d).&nbsp.\nThe Notice to Foundation should be sent to 11420 Santa Monica Blvd, PO Box 252111, Los Angeles, CA 90025 (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).&nbsp.\nThe Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.&nbsp.\nIf Foundation and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Foundation may commence an arbitration proceeding.&nbsp.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Foundation or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Foundation is entitled.<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Procedures </b>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (\u201cAAA\u201d) rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.\nFor information on the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org.&nbsp.\nInformation about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\u2019s consumer arbitration page, <u>http://www.adr.org/</u> as may be updated from time to time.&nbsp.\nIf there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would.&nbsp.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.\nAlthough arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law.&nbsp.\nDecisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.\n</p>\n<p>Unless Foundation and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.&nbsp.\nIf the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA.&nbsp.\nIf your claim is for $10,000 or less, Foundation agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.&nbsp.\nIf your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.&nbsp.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Costs of Arbitration\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.&nbsp.\nIf the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Foundation will pay all Arbitration Fees.&nbsp.\nIf the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Foundation will pay your portion of such fees.&nbsp.\nIn addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Foundation will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.&nbsp.\nAny payment of attorneys\u2019 fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Confidentiality\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Severability\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified.&nbsp.\nIf a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.&nbsp.\nThe remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.<b>\n</b>\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<b>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement\n</b>\n</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Foundation agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Platforms, you may reject any such change by sending Foundation written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above.&nbsp.\nBy rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>InstagramTwitterDiscordBlogCommunity
