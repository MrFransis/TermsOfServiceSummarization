personalized content to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.</li>\n<li>Along with our Partners, we may use tracking technologies such as cookies, JavaScript, beacons and Local Storage such as HTML5.\nOur Partners may also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash.\nLocal Storage (LS) such as HTML5 and Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash are used to store content information and preferences.\nVarious browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LS\u2019s.\nBeacons are clear graphic image(s) of 1\u00d71 pixel that is delivered

information about which vendors and which purposes an end user has consented to with vendors.</p>\n<p>Tappx will follow IAB standards and Consent Management Platform compliant with IAB requirements, in our own SDK in order to allow Tappx to read and transmit information about which purposes the end user has consented.</p>\n<strong>Online Behavioral Advertising:</strong>\n<p>We use third parties who collect data about their apps\u2019 and sites\u2019 visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies regarding your online activities, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.</p>\n<p>These third parties include Publishers, Advertisers and ad networks that may collect information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your online activities over time and across different apps and websites.</p>\n<p>Like most Advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to the recipient.\nWhen an End User visits a third-party website or app on which that network advertising company has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the individual\u2019s interest and deliver one of our advertisements.</p>\n<strong>End User choice and Opt-Out.</strong>\n<p>Ads delivered through Tappx SDK will allow End Users to out-put with a mechanism that permits End Users to set their preferences.</p>\n<p>End Users in the EEA can withdraw their consent given to Tappx to collect and process data to optimize interest-based ads, either by revoking such consent on the page or app where they have found reference to Tappx as a partner or by writing to&nbsp;dpo@tappx.com&nbsp;indicating on it their

identifiable information we process on behalf of our Clients for&nbsp.\na period of up to twelve (12) months unless otherwise required by law or applicable contract.\nAfter the period, Tappx may retain and use such data in an aggregated format, as necessary for internal analytical purposes, to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce agreements.\nWe may adopt shorter retention periods if so directed by our Clients.</p>\n<p>Please note that in most of the cases we have no direct relationship with the End Users.\nAn End User who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information should direct his query to the relevant Publisher.\nIf an End User requests us to remove any personally identifiable information relating to him or her, we will respond to their request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>\n<strong>Security</strong>\n<p>Tappx has implemented reasonable security measures in order to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.\nWhile we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to information will not occur.\nwe make good faith efforts to

any personally identifiable information relating to children under the age of 13.</p>\n<p>Please note that while we strive hard to ensure that our policies are respected, we cannot be held responsible for the practices of our Publishers.\nOur publishers are responsible to ensure that their privacy practices comply with applicable privacy laws and requirements.</p>\n<p>If you have knowledge of any incident in which we may be collecting personally identifiable information relating to children under the age of 13, or that our SDK is included in any service (such as a mobile app) that is directed
