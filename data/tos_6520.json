about products and services that may be of interest to you, we may share information with other companies, such as publishers, advertisers and measurement analytics providers.\nFor example, we may share device-related data (such as device identifier, type of device, IP address, cookies and other information associated with your browsing and app usage) and individual preferences and characteristics (such as insights and inferences related to shopping patterns and behaviors).\nThis information does not identify you directly, but is necessary to personalize the advertisements you receive.\nSam\u2019s Club does not receive payment for this information.</p>\n<p>We also allow companies that show advertisements on our webpages or our apps to collect information from your browsers or devices via the use of cookies or other technologies.\nLike many companies, we may allow cookie matching with select partners.\nHowever, these parties are not authorized to access information from
