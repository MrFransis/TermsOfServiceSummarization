diligence;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Provided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose against your privacy and confidentiality interests,

our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Share</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We do not share personal information collected through this

issues.</li>\n<li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Rave Mobile Safety, our Users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We attempt to

when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>.\nAs we continue to develop our business, we may buy, sell, or share assets in connection with, for example, a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or

consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changing or Deleting Your Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may update or correct information about yourself by emailing us at privacy@ravemobilesafety.com.\n&nbsp;We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law, to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or for other legitimate business purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may contact you to request that you update your Personal Data on a regular basis to ensure its integrity for the purposes of ongoing data management.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Opt-in/Opt-out Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>By providing an email address or other contact information on the Rave Mobile Safety Sites, you agree that we may contact you in the event of a change in this Privacy Policy, to provide you with any service related notices, or to provide you with information about our events, invitations, or related educational information.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, \u201copt-in\u201d is generally defined as any affirmative action by a user to submit or receive information, as the case may be.</p>\n<p>We currently provide the following opt-out opportunities:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAt any time, you can follow a link provided in offers, newsletters or other email messages (except for e-commerce confirmation or service notice emails) received from us to unsubscribe from the service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nAt any time, you can contact us through privacy@ravemobilesafety.com or the address provided below to unsubscribe from the service and opt-out of our right per your consent under the terms of this Privacy Policy to share your Personal Data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, please note that we always reserve the right to contact you in the event of a change in this Privacy Policy, or to provide you with any service related notices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Links</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Sites may contain links to webpages operated by parties other than Rave Mobile Safety.\nWe do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites.\nOur inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators.\nFurther, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature.\nThese websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website.\nRave Mobile Safety strongly recommends that each User review the third party's terms and policies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>International Transfer</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and mandatory government standards regarding the protection of Personal Data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since we are a global organization, Personal Data and any additional information submitted may be used globally in connection with employment, business processes within Rave Mobile Safety, or communicating with our clients.\nTherefore, Personal Data may be transferred to other Rave Mobile Safety entities worldwide, where it will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and laws that are applicable in each country.\nCountries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.</p>\n<p>If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards and rely on legally-provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders to ensure that your Personal Data is protected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Protect Personal Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Rave Mobile Safety maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User's Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms.&nbsp.\nFor example, we use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and transport layer security (TLS) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If Rave Mobile Safety collects account information for payment or credit, Rave Mobile Safety will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The Site is not intended for use by children.&nbsp.\nWe do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13.&nbsp.\nIf a child has provided us with Personal Data, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records.\nIf you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at privacy@ravemobilesafety.com.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nIf we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Direct Marketing and \u201cDo Not Track\u201d Signals</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Rave Mobile Safety does not track its customers over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals.\nHowever, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.\nIf you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Privacy Rights Of California Residents</strong>\n</p>\n<p>California residents are entitled under the California Consumer Privacy Act to contact us for various purposes, including to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nWe do not disclose personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nCalifornia residents have the right to be informed as to what personal information about them we may have, how we collected and may use that information and how to have it corrected or deleted, and may request further information about our compliance with this law by contacting us by one of the means listed in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section below.\u201d</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time.\nWe will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent.\nWe will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services or products, email notification or privacy policy changes).\nWe will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How to Contact Us</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you have any specific questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us via email or writing to us

using information for a purpose other than those set out in this Privacy Policy.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Legal Basis for Collecting Personal Data</strong>\n<br>\nWhenever we collect Personal Data from you, we may do so on the following legal bases:<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;Your consent to such collection and use;<br>\n2.&nbsp;Out of necessity for the performance of an agreement between us and you, such as your agreement to use our services and products;<br>\n3.&nbsp;Our legitimate business interest, including but not limited to the following circumstances where collecting or using Personal Data is necessary for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intra-company transfers for client data for administrative purposes;</li>\n<li>Product development and enhancement, where the processing enables Rave Mobile Safety to enhance, modify, personalize, or otherwise improve our services and communications for the benefit of our customers, and to better understand how people interact with our Sites;</li>\n<li>Fraud detection and prevention;</li>\n<li>Enhancement of our cybersecurity, including improving the security of our network and information systems.\nand</li>\n<li>General business operations and diligence;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<br>\nProvided that, in each circumstance, we will weigh the necessity of our processing for the purpose against your privacy and confidentiality interests, including taking into account your reasonable expectations, the impact of processing, and any safeguards which are or could be put in place.\nIn all circumstances, we will limit such processing for our legitimate business interest to what is necessary for its purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>Information We Share</strong>\n<br>\nWe do not share personal information collected through the Sites with companies, organizations and individuals outside of the Company unless one of the following circumstances applies:<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.&nbsp;With your consent.\n</strong>We will share personal data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Rave Mobile Safety when we have your consent to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>2.&nbsp;Enterprise accounts.\n</strong>Your employer or school may offer you access to our Services.\nWe will share personal data you provide with your employer or school.\nYour employer or school can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.&nbsp;For external processing.\n</strong>We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or partners to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\nThese third parties include communication service providers, Emergency Service Providers and public safety agencies.\nSpecific examples of permitted disclosure of personal data include:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;Your wireless phone number may be submitted to other service providers in order to locate the device during an emergency or transmit messages that you send or receive.<br>\n2.&nbsp;In the event an emergency call or other direct communication is placed from your phone or device, and provided that the agency receiving the call uses our Services, your information may be displayed on the answering operator's workstation screen or to emergency responders.<br>\n3.&nbsp;In the event a non-9-1-1 call is made to a public safety agency from your phone and is then routed into a 9-1-1 system, if the receiving 9-1-1 agency uses our Services, your information may be displayed on the 9-1-1 operator's workstation screen.\nIn these situations, once information is passed to the local 9-1-1 authorities, we no longer have control over the transmission of the information.\nIt may be conveyed verbally over an unsecured radio or transmitted in some other way to the responding emergency response team or others.<br>\n4.&nbsp;In the event an Emergency Service Provider uses The Services database query tools, and your information includes an address within the querying Emergency Service Provider's jurisdiction, and a portion of your information matches the Emergency Service Provider's query criteria, and if you have elected to participate in this portion of the our Services, your information will be displayed in the search results presented to the Emergency Service Provider.</p>\n<p>It is our policy to only share Personal Data with contractors, service providers and other third parties who are bound by contractual obligations to keep Personal Data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.\n&nbsp;Under certain circumstances, you may avoid having us share your information with our business partners and vendors by not granting us permission to share your information.\n&nbsp;Not granting us permission to share your information with our business partners or vendors may limit your access to their services through the Sites.\nWe do not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nFor Legal Reasons.</strong> We will share Personal Data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Rave Mobile Safety if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n<p>1.\nMeet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.<br>\n2.\nEnforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.<br>\n3.\nDetect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.<br>\n4.\nProtect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Rave Mobile Safety, our Users or the public as required or permitted by law.<br>\nWe attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency.\nWe may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.&nbsp;Business Transfers.</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, sell, or share assets in connection with, for example, a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy.\n&nbsp;In such transactions, Personal Data about our users is often a transferred business asset.\n&nbsp;In the event that Rave Mobile Safety itself or substantially all of our assets are acquired, Personal Data about our users may be one of the transferred assets.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.&nbsp;Aggregate Site Use Information.</strong> We may share aggregate and anonymized/pseudonymized Personal Data to advertisers and other third parties in order to promote or describe use of the Sites.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>Your Failure to Provide Personal

access and use our services on our Sites or parts of our services available via the Sites.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>Our Retention of Your Personal Data</strong>\n<br>\nWe may retain your Personal Data for a period of time consistent with the original purpose for collection.\n&nbsp;For example, we keep your Personal Data for no longer than reasonably necessary for your use of our products and services and for a reasonable period of time afterward.\nWe also may retain your Personal Data during the period of time needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests, conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, and enforce our agreements.</p>\n<p>If your account is removed from our sites and services, we generally delete account information within 30 days of account removal, except as noted below.\nWe retain your Personal Data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our Terms of Use, or fulfill your request to \u201cunsubscribe\u201d from further messages from us.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>Your Choices and Accessing, Updating or Deleting Your Personal Data</strong>\n<br>\nWhenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with choices about how we use your personal data.\nWe also aim to provide you with access to your Personal Data.\nIf that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it \u2013 unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.\nSubject to applicable law, you may obtain a copy of personal information we maintain about you or you may update or correct inaccuracies in that information through your Profile or Account, or by contacting us at privacy@ravemobilesafety.com.\nTo help protect

your organization provides your information on your behalf, you must contact the organization to access this information or request changes to your information.</p>\n<p>You may also update or correct information about yourself by emailing us at privacy@ravemobilesafety.com.\n&nbsp;We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law, to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements or for other legitimate business purposes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We may contact you to request that you update your Personal Data on a regular basis to ensure its integrity for the purposes of ongoing data management.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Our Opt-in/Opt-out Policy</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By providing an email address or other contact information on the Rave Mobile Safety Sites, you agree that we may contact you in the event of a change in this Privacy Policy, to provide you with any service related notices, or to provide you with information about our events, invitations, or related educational information.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, \u201copt-in\u201d is generally defined as any affirmative action by a user to submit or receive information.</p>\n<p>We currently provide the following opt-out opportunities:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;At any time, you can follow a link provided in offers, newsletters or other messages (except for e-commerce confirmation or service notice emails) received from us to unsubscribe from the service.\n&nbsp.\n&nbsp;<br>\n2.&nbsp;At any time, you can contact us through privacy@ravemobilesafety.com or

contact the organization to access this information or request changes to your information.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, please note that we always reserve the right to contact you in the event of a change in this Privacy Policy, or to provide you with any service-related notices.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Links</strong>\n<br>\nThe Sites may contain links to webpages operated by parties other than Rave Mobile Safety.\nWe do not control such websites and are not responsible for their contents or the privacy policies or other practices of such websites.\nOur inclusion of links to such websites does not imply any endorsement of the material on such websites or any association with their operators.\nFurther, it is up to the User to take precautions to ensure that whatever links the User selects or software the User downloads (whether from this Site or other websites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, trojan horses, defects and other items of a destructive nature.\nThese websites and services may have their own privacy policies, which the User will be subject to upon linking to the third party's website.\nRave Mobile Safety strongly recommends that each User review the third party's terms and policies.</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>International Transfer</strong>\n<br>\nWe are committed to complying with applicable laws, regulations and mandatory government standards regarding the protection of Personal Data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since we are a global organization, Personal Data and any additional information submitted may be used globally in connection with employment, business processes within Rave Mobile Safety, or communicating with our clients.\nTherefore, Personal Data may be transferred to other Rave Mobile Safety entities worldwide, where it will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy and laws that are applicable in each country.\nCountries where we process data may have laws which are different, and potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.</p>\n<p>If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards and rely on legally provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders to ensure that your Personal Data is protected.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<br>\n<strong>How We Protect Personal Data</strong>\n<br>\nRave Mobile Safety maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User's Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.\nWe implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms.\n&nbsp;For example, we use commercially reasonable security measures such as encryption, firewalls, and transport layer security (TLS) or hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect Personal Data.\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If Rave Mobile Safety collects account information for payment or credit, Rave Mobile Safety will use the information only to complete the task for which the account information was offered.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Children</strong>\n<br>\nWe do not intentionally collect any information about children under the age of 13 unless and until a relevant institution has provided consent and authorization for a child under the age of 13 to use the Sites or services and for us to collect information from such child.\n&nbsp;If you believe that we might have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under age 13 without proper consent, please contact us at privacy@ravemobilesafety.com.\n&nbsp;If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal
