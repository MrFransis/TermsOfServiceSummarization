liability to us, or otherwise, if you pass away/when we are notified of your death.</p>\n<p>27.3\tIf what you have done can be corrected or amended, we may give you a reasonable opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p>27.4\tIf we end your rights to use the App and Services:</p>\n<p>27.4.1\tYou must stop all activities authorised by these Terms, including your use of the App, the VitraCash Account, the

(Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 for any third party to enforce any term hereunder.</p>\n<strong>31.\nIF A COURT FINDS PART OF THIS CONTRACT ILLEGAL, THE REST WILL CONTINUE IN FORCE</strong>\n<p>Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately.\nIf any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<strong>32.\nEVEN IF WE DELAY IN ENFORCING THIS CONTRACT, WE CAN STILL ENFORCE IT LATER</strong>\n<p>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.\nIf we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things, and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>\n<strong>33.\nWHICH LAWS APPLY TO THIS CONTRACT&nbsp;</strong>\n<p>These
