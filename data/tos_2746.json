Trademarks</li>\n<li>1.2 Permitted Use</li>\n<li>1.3 Restricted use that requires a trademark license</li>\n<li>1.4 Logo Usage Guidelines\n<ul>\n<li>1.4.1 Attribution</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Trademark Policy\n<p>The objective of the Arch Linux trademark policy is to encourage widespread use of the Arch Linux trademarks by the Arch Linux community while controlling that use in order to avoid confusion on the part of Arch Linux users and the general public, to maintain the value of the image and reputation of the trademarks and to protect them from inappropriate or unauthorised use.\n</p>\n<p>The sections below describe what is allowed, what is not allowed, and cases in which you should ask permission.\nIf you have any doubt, please contact us at <b>trademarks@archlinux.org</b>.\n</p>\nThe Trademarks\n<p>Aaron Griffin (hereinafter the \"Arch Linux Project Lead\") and Judd Vinet, on behalf of Arch Linux, own a number of trademarks including \"ARCHLINUX\", \"ARCH LINUX\", \"A simple, lightweight Linux distribution\" and the stylized Arch Linux logo.\nThe trademarks are recognized in both word and logo form.\nAny mark beginning with the letters ARCH is sufficiently similar to one or more of the trademarks that permission will be needed in order to use it.\nThis policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form (collectively referred to as \"Trademarks\").\n</p>\nPermitted Use\n<p>Certain usages of the Trademarks are fine and no specific permission from us is needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Advocacy.</b> Arch Linux is built by, and largely for, its community.\nWe share access to the Trademarks with the entire community for the purposes of discussion, development and advocacy.\nWe recognise that most of the open source discussion and development areas are for non-commercial purposes and will allow the use of the Trademarks in this context, provided:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Trademark is used in a manner consistent with the Usage Guidelines below</li>\n<li>there is no commercial intent behind the use</li>\n<li>what you are referring to is in fact Arch Linux.\nIf someone is confused into thinking that what is not Arch Linux is in fact Arch Linux, you are probably doing something wrong.</li>\n<li>there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its related projects unless it has been approved by and is accountable to the Arch Linux Project Lead</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>Derived works.</b> The ability to customise Arch Linux to meet your specific needs is one of the great strengths of free software in general, and Arch Linux in particular.\nWhile we encourage customisation and derivation of Arch Linux, we must balance that freedom with the integrity of the Trademarks and the quality which they represent.\nTo help reach that balance, we have established the following guidelines and definitions.\n</p>\n<p>We recognise and encourage the concept of a \"<b>remix.</b>\" Remixes are derived versions of Arch Linux, and it is intended that any software and hardware certifications will apply to a Remix.\nTherefore the changes from official Arch Linux products must be minimal to be permitted to use the Trademarks.\nThese changes can include configuration changes through the existing Arch Linux configuration management tools, changes to artwork and graphical themes and some variance in package selection.\nIn general, a Remix can have applications from the Arch Linux archives added, or default applications removed, but removing or changing any infrastructure components (e.g., shared libraries or desktop components) will result in changes too large for the resulting product to be called by a Trademark.\nNote that if the nature of the product's divergence from Arch Linux changes, the Remix naming and Trademark use may no longer apply.\n</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are creating a derivative of Arch Linux, you may use the Trademarks in association with the software product provided:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the changes are minimal and unsubstantial, as described above</li>\n<li>there is no commercial intent associated with the new product</li>\n<li>the Trademark is used in a way that makes it clear that your project is a development effort related to the Arch Linux source, but that the software you are working upon is not in fact Arch Linux as distributed by the Arch Linux project</li>\n<li>there is no suggestion (through words or appearance) that your project is approved, sponsored, or affiliated with Arch Linux or its related projects unless it has been approved by and is governed by the Arch Linux Project Lead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are producing a new product which is based on Arch Linux but which has more substantial changes than those described above as a Remix, you are allowed to state (and we would encourage you to do so) that your product is \"derived from Arch Linux\", \"based on Arch Linux\", or \"a derivative of Arch Linux\" but you may not use the Trademarks to refer to your product.\nIn some cases you may be allowed to use the Trademarks, but permission must be explicitly granted by the Arch Linux Project Lead.\nIn that event, these products will need a trademark license, and such a license can be revoked if the nature of your divergence from Arch Linux changes.\nProducts which include very invasive changes, such as a new kernel, the inclusion of packages which are not part of the Arch Linux repositories, or anything else that significantly impacts the technical quality or user experience would fall into this category are unlikely to be approved.\n(Note that if you are including packages which are not part of the Arch Linux repositories, we encourage you to work within the community processes, such as the Arch User Repository (AUR) to submit and maintain those packages within the community repositories in order to minimise this issue.)\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Building on Arch Linux or for Arch Linux.</b> If you are producing new software which is intended for use with or on Arch Linux, you may use the trademark in a way which indicates the intent of your product.\nFor example, if you are developing a system management tool for Arch Linux, acceptable project titles would be \"System Management for Arch Linux\" or \"Arch Linux Based Systems Management\".\nWe would strongly discourage, and likely would consider to be problematic, a name such as ArchMan, Arch Management, ArchTools, etc.\nFurthermore, you may not use the Trademarks in a way which implies an endorsement where that does not exist, or which attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or brand of the project.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Commentary and parody.</b> The Arch Linux Trademarks are designed to cover use of a mark to imply origin or endorsement by the project.\nWhen a user downloads something called Arch Linux, they should know it comes from the Arch Linux project.\nThis helps Arch Linux build a reputation that will not be damaged by confusion around what is, and is not, Arch Linux.\nUsing the Trademarks in your discussion, commentary, criticism or parody, in ways that unequivocally do not imply endorsement, is permissible.\nAnyone is free to write articles, create websites, blog about, or talk about Arch Linux -- as long as it's clear to everyone -- including people completely unfamiliar with Arch Linux -- that they are simply referring to Arch Linux and in no way speaking for the Arch Linux project.\n</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to review all usage within the open source community, and to object to any usage that appears to overstep the bounds of discussion and good-faith non-commercial development.\nIn any event, once a project has left the open source project phase or otherwise become a commercial project, this policy does not authorize any use of the Trademarks in connection to that project.\n</p>\nRestricted use that requires a trademark license\n<p>Explicit permission from the Arch Linux Project Lead is necessary to use any of the Trademarks under any circumstances other than those specifically permitted above.\nThese include:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any commercial use.</li>\n<li>Use on or in relation to a software product that includes or is built on top of a product supplied by us, if there is any commercial intent associated with that product.</li>\n<li>Use for merchandising purposes, e.g.\non t-shirts and the like.</li>\n<li>Services relating to any of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you wish to have permission for any of the uses above or for any other use which is not specifically referred to in this policy, please email <b>trademarks@archlinux.org</b> and we will let you know as soon as possible if your proposed use is permissible.\nPermission may only be granted subject to certain conditions and these may include the requirement that you enter into an agreement with us to maintain the quality of the product and/or service which you intend to supply at a prescribed level.\n</p>\n<p>While there may be exceptions, it is very unlikely that we will approve Trademark use in the following cases:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use of a Trademark in a company name.</li>\n<li>Use of a Trademark in a domain name which has a commercial intent.\nThe commercial intent can range from promotion of a company or product, to collecting revenue generated by advertising.</li>\n<li>The calling of any software or product by the name Arch Linux (or another related Trademark), unless that software or product is a substantially unmodified Arch Linux product, or properly labelled as a \"Remix\" as described above.</li>\n<li>Use in combination with any other marks or logos.\nThis include use of a Trademark in a manner that creates a \"combined mark,\" or use that integrates other wording with the Trademark in a way that the public may think of the use as a new mark (for example Club Arch Linux or ArchBooks, or in a way that by use of special fonts or presentation with nearby words or images conveys an impression that the two are tied in some way).</li>\n<li>Use in combination with any product or service which is presented as being Certified or Official or formally associated with us or our products or services.</li>\n<li>Use in a way which implies an endorsement where that does not exist, or which attempts to unfairly or confusingly capitalise on the goodwill or brand of the project.</li>\n<li>Use of a Trademark in a manner that disparages Arch Linux and is not clearly third-party parody.</li>\n<li>On or in relation to a software product which constitutes a substantially modified version of a product supplied by the Arch Linux project, that is to say with material changes to the code, or services relating to such a product.</li>\n<li>In a title or metatag of a web page whose primary intention or result is to influence search engine rankings or result listings, rather than for discussion, development or advocacy of the Trademarks.</li>\n</ul>\nLogo Usage Guidelines\n<p>In addition to the restrictions imposed above, <b>the Trademark declaration ( \u2122 ) must remain intact</b> whenever displaying the logos.\n</p>\n<p>Our logos are presented in multiple colours and it is important that their visual integrity be maintained.\nIt is therefore preferable that the logos only be used in their standard form but if you should feel the need to alter them in any way, please keep the following in mind:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any scaling should retain the original proportions of the logo.</li>\n<li>A monochrome version (white, black, etc.) should be used in certain situations, such as when applying it to colourful or \"busy\" backdrops that would otherwise make the logo difficult to read.</li>\n</ul>\nAttribution\n<p>\n<i>The Arch Linux trademark

document</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul> Common sense introduction\n<ul>\n<li>If you choose to use the Arch Linux distribution, you are welcomed, and encouraged to embrace the\nArch Linux principles.</li>\n<li>When asking for help, read the manual, do your research and provide details for those you are\nasking for assistance.</li>\n<li>When offering help, be as patient and tactful as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arch is a community of volunteers.\nRather than providing a complicated pattern of balanced freedoms\nand restrictions, as well as the time, resources and personnel required to interpret and administer\nsuch rules, we have chosen a simple principle to embrace for the benefit of all.\nTherefore, this\nentire document may be condensed into one simple admonition:</p>\n<p>\n<em>\n<strong>Proactively seek to give of yourself and to bring only benefit to your peers and community.</strong>\n</em>\n</p> Code of conduct\n<p>The <em>minimum necessary standards</em> when interacting with others in the Arch Linux community comprise\nfour main points.\nIn addition to those points, there are guidelines specific to each of the\ncommunity fora.\nthe Forums, Wiki, IRC, Mailing lists,\nAUR and Bug tracker.</p> Respect Respect other users\n<p>Arch Linux is a respectful, inclusive community.\nAnti-social or offensive behaviour will not be\ntolerated.\nSimply put, treat others as you would be treated.\nrespect them and their views, even if\nyou disagree with them.\nWhen you do find yourself disagreeing.\ncounter the idea or the argument,\nrather than engage in <em>ad hominem</em> attacks.</p> Respect other operating systems and projects\n<p>Maligning other FOSS projects or distributions, or any other operating systems and their users is\nprohibited.\nThe entire Arch team is happy to volunteer their time and energy to provide you with\nthe Arch Linux distribution, documentation and forums.\nKindly show respect toward the volunteers,\nusers and communities of other projects, distributions and operating systems as well.\nViews,\nexperiences and opinions are always welcome, but unproductive slander is not.</p> Respect the staff\n<p>Support staff have been chosen for their ability\nto exercise consistently good judgement and shall have the final say.\nNote that Arch Linux is not\nrun as a democracy.\nThe staff shall always attempt to implement universally peaceful solutions, but\nin the end, are charged with the responsibility of maintaining peaceful, civil order for the\nmajority of the community.\nTherefore, they cannot always please everyone with the decisions made.\nDo your part to contribute to a healthy community and environment.</p> No trolling\n<p>A \"troll\" is a person who misuses their forum freedoms to intentionally disrupt, cause controversy,\nincite an argument, and/or receive negative attention by deliberately posting provocative content.\nThe term may also be used as a verb, to refer to the act of posting such content, or as a noun, to\nrefer the content itself.</p>\n<p>Trolls can be deceitful and frequently use indirect expressions of hostility through ambivalence\nand implicit messages as a method of covertly insulting, intimidating, or inciting a person or\npersons for their own sadistic pleasure.\nThey often pick their words very carefully and are\ntherefore able to defend their masked attempts at creating unrest, redirecting the blame onto the\ncommunity and its supposed failure to understand them properly.\nTrolling is prohibited.</p> Do not flame\n<p>Flaming, in the most common sense definition, is directing negative, disrespectful, and/or\ninsulting comments toward someone.\nAn equally or more negative response, resulting in a cycling\nexchange of insults is often the consequence.\nFlaming fellow members (including the Arch team) will\nnot be tolerated.\nAvoid personal insults and sarcastic or patronizing language.\n<em>Discussions can\nbe productive, but quarreling is always destructive.</em>\n</p> Be responsible\n<p>If an interpersonal issue arises, be open-minded to the possibility that your behaviour or intent,\nactual or perceived, may have contributed to the problem.\nArch Linux users are encouraged to\ncultivate self awareness and remain peaceable toward their peers.\nTaking responsibility for our\nactions is often a good first step toward a peaceful reconciliation.</p> Member accounts\n<p>Limit your fora membership to one account only.\nHaving multiple accounts is an unnecessary use of\nresources.\nFurther, it may be interpreted as trolling behaviour.</p>\n<p>Any form of sockpuppetry or impersonation is\nprohibited.</p> Legality Criminal solicitation\n<p>Criminal solicitation is forbidden in\nthis community.\nIn this context, \"criminal solicitation\" shall mean, \"To actively or implicitly\nfacilitate, incite, move, or persuade others to some act of lawlessness or illegal activity.\"</p>\n<p>Therefore do not post discussions which demonstrate, or link to, criminal solicitation in any form.\nThis includes, but is not limited to information or links to facilitate illegal drug use, theft,\nnetwork intrusion, creation of code for malicious purposes, prohibited software copying, prohibited\nuse of copyrighted/patented material, so-called \"warez\", or sites which provide torrents or links\nto such content.\nIllegal content shall be removed swiftly and dealt with in full accordance with\nknown applicable law.</p> Spam/Advertising/Solicitation\n<p>Spamming is forbidden.\nPlease alert staff to the presence of spam should you encounter it.\nOffending spam accounts and associated IP addresses will be banned.\nDo not reply to spam posts as\nit increases the amount of work required to clean them up.</p>\n<p>Publicity, if it is related to Arch (as a project or community) or GNU/Linux/FOSS, will usually be\nallowed.\nPromoting web-invites, blog posts or commercial promotions are actively discouraged, or\noutright prohibited.\nRegistering just to promote your issue/cause, FOSS-related or not, treats the\ncommunity as a resource and is not acceptable.\nif unsure about the appropriateness of your content,\ncontact the support staff before posting.\nAlso be aware that posting shortened/obscured links is a\ntechnique of spammers and deliberately inhibits the communities ability to judge the propriety of\nthe link.\nTherefore, only post links that include a clear destination.</p> Correctness\n<p>The Arch Linux community value technical correctness.\nWhen seeking or giving help, remember to\nstrive for accuracy, completeness and correctness.\nAn excellent introduction to the expectations of\nthe Arch community is ESR's How To Ask Questions The Smart Way.</p>\n<p>Other considerations in this category include:</p> Arch Linux distribution support ONLY\n<p>Arch-based distributions have their own support fora and users of those distributions should be\nactively encouraged to seek support there.\nThese distributions often use different packages,\npackage versions, repositories, or make custom system configurations silently, practically\nrendering support for such projects within Arch Linux impossible.\nCommunity technical support shall\nonly be provided for the Arch Linux distribution and the Arch User Repository.\nPosting issues with,\nand requesting support for, derivative distributions or operating systems other than Arch Linux are\nprohibited.</p> Personal topics/rants\n<p>Rants and complaints are actively discouraged.\nThis type of content is much better suited to a blog\nor other personal web space and is considered undesirable in the Arch community.\nYour contributions\nshould be open, productive and inviting to all participants.\nAlso see\nRespect other operating systems and projects.</p> Avoid controversy/controversial topics\n<p>There is no explicit list of topics considered to be \"trollish\", controversial or provocative, but\nin the past, posts pertaining to <strong>Religion, Sports, Race, Nationalism</strong> and <strong>Politics</strong> have\ninvariably been closed.\nTherefore, <em>\n<strong>specifically avoid these and all divisive topics in the Arch\ncommunity.</strong>\n</em> The staff certainly realize that such issues are deeply ingrained human realities.\nHowever, this is a technical community and is not intended nor able to effectively facilitate such\ncommentary nor the resulting unrest.</p> Ineffective discussion (\"bikeshed\")\n<p>Discussions stating the equivalent of \"there is a problem with the Arch system and methodology, we\nneed to discuss it\" (sometimes referred to as \"bikeshedding\") have been repeatedly proven\nineffective and inflammatory and will usually be closed down after a warning from the support\nstaff.\nArch is a Do It Yourself community.\nIf you have identified a systemic issue, find a solution\nthat works for you, implement it, then post.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, questioning or discussing the methods used by the Arch Linux development team will be\nmonitored closely and locked or removed <em>if deemed unhelpful and/or unproductive</em>.\nHarsh,\nunproductive criticism is also uncalled for.</p>\n<p>If you have a question regarding Arch development, ensure that your topic poses a specific question\nand be open-minded to responses.\nIf possible, provide a solution or partial solution.\nSubmitting\ncode and patches for discussion is always more pragmatic than asking others to do it for you.</p> Freedom\n<p>\n<em>Liberty</em> is the state of being unencumbered by oppressive authority, whereas <em>freedom</em> is the\nability to demonstrate self determination.\nTherefore, we must all sacrifice a small degree of\nliberty in order to enjoy certain freedoms.\nWhile the free and open exchange of assistance, speech,\nideas and opinions is highly regarded and encouraged in the Arch community, it must be noted that\nthe freedom granted to participants is not unbounded.\nrather, it is <em>relative freedom</em>.\nIt\nco-exists, along with the entire Arch Linux distribution, within the boundaries of the above\nguidelines and principles.\nComplaints of censorship or intolerance are therefore baseless and\nunfounded, since this necessary framework must simultaneously provide reasonable limitations.\nTo\nillustrate, we are aware of the physical laws which govern energy and matter, yet we do not\ncomplain of their oppression.\nInstead, we recognize that such laws are essential for our welfare.\nLikewise, the Arch community's high standards reflected in these guidelines regulate community\nfreedom for the common good and protection of all.\nThe key, then, to true freedom in this community\nis to cultivate benevolence toward others and to harmonize our attitude with the Arch Way by\nbringing only benefits to our peers.\nThis allows members to satisfy all contributive impulses\nwithout aggravating themselves or encroaching on the freedom of others.\nEmbracing the above\nprinciples and obeying the guidelines therefore benefits the entire community by providing freedom\nfrom the disorder and other oppressive, harmful and negative consequences of a more chaotic\napproach.</p> Specific fora guidelines\n<p>In addition to the common code, each of the fora has its own specific\nguidelines summarized in the following subsections.</p> Forums\n<p>Guidelines specific to the Arch forums.</p> How to post\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Choose clear, informative subjects.\nThis is more likely to elicit response from experienced users\nwho have knowledge about that particular topic.\nIt also makes the topic easy to reference and\nfind in forum searches by future users with similar problems.\nFurther, avoid extraneous phrases\nsuch as [HELP!], [URGENT], etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A sincere effort to use modest and proper language and grammar is a sign of respect toward the\ncommunity that will certainly be appreciated and is quite likely to elicit positive responses.\nRefrain from using so-called \"textspeak\", \"netspeak\", \"leetspeak\" and all other forms of\ninternet slang.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When asking questions, provide as much information as possible, including error messages,\nterminal output, logs, what you have previously tried, what documentation and searches you have\nattempted, and related configuration files.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Choose one topic per thread.\nLong threads are typically discouraged in the technical issue\nsubforums.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Post your question in only one subforum.\npick the most relevant, and post there.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not post tutorials or \"how to's\": documentation belongs in the wiki, where it can be\nmaintained.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When responding to an existing thread, always read the original post and attempt to focus on the\noriginal topic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, when a solution is found, mark your thread as solved by editing the first post and\nprepending the tag [SOLVED] to the title in the \"Subject\" field.</p>\n<p>Note that you should avoid using [CLOSED], which is instead used by the system to mark a thread\nwhich is no longer accessible for new posts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If a thread is marked as [SOLVED], do not reply stating the equivalent of \"I am having a similar\nissue..\".\nstart a new thread and link to the [SOLVED] thread, if relevant.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Pasting pictures and code\n<p>Use [code] tags when pasting console snippets.\nUse a pastebin client when posting large\namounts of code.\nDo <strong>not</strong> use pastebin.com\u2014it is blocked for some users\nand has a history of annoying issues (JavaScript, adverts, poor formatting, etc).</p>\n<p>For non-English locale users: Prepend <code>LC_ALL=C</code> to posted commands so that the output will be in\nEnglish.\nDo not post full screen pictures.\nuse links to the images instead, optionally with\nthumbnails.\nAny image with dimensions greater than 250\u00d7250px or over 50 KiB in size will be\nremoved.\nDo <strong>not</strong> post screenshots of text output.\npost the actual text.</p> Life is a two-way street\n<p>A simple, yet profound and undeniable truth.\nEnsure your thread includes details and information\nthat others will find useful.\nShare your findings with the community.\nShare your failures as well.\nPosting the equivalent of \"Nevermind, I fixed it.\" in your thread or deleting your own posts for\nsimilar reasons is not only selfish and useless to the community, but a complete waste of resources\nand everyone's time.\nAlso, demanding help or showing an obvious impatience toward getting it is\nunwanted here.\nArch is provided by a community of volunteers.\nArch users are strongly encouraged to\ndo research, make an effort, report back in the thread, help others, get involved, and contribute\nto the community.</p>\n<p>Do not be a \"help vampire\".</p> Product recommendation requests\n<p>Threads seeking advice about computer product recommendations are discouraged.\nSuch topics, like\nthe technology they discuss, quickly become obsolete and are unlikely to provide any lasting\nbenefit to the wider community.\nYou are expected to be able to do your own research and draw your\nown conclusions about which product best suits your individual requirements.</p> Old threads/\"necro-bumping\"\n<p>Do your part to keep the forums tidy.\nAs the wiki is where Arch is documented, posting in old\nthreads (\"necrobumping\") is generally discouraged in the technical issue subforums, since it can\npotentially create disjointed \"zombie\" information.\noutdated posts with data which is no longer\nrelevant due to Arch's rolling nature, combined with more recent posts reflecting more current\ncircumstance.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Rules of thumb</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you have a question, start a new thread and link to the old if relevant.\nYou can also report\nthe old thread so staff can close it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have something to add and judge that your information is related, but more up-to-date,\nstart a new thread and link to the old if desired, but avoid duplicating effort by posting\ninformation already contained in the Arch wiki.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you have a version-agnostic or corresponding solution, necrobumping <em>may</em> be appropriate if\nthe thread is not more than a year or two old.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> No power-posting/empty posts\n<p>Power-posting is best described as posting empty and worthless messages.\nIt is not tolerated.\nPeople may have two reasons to do this: to increase their post count meaninglessly, or to lend\nsupport to an idea as if it were a vote.\nExamples of power-posting include, but are not limited to,\nreplying with \"+1\", \"lol\", \"me too\", \"I agree\", or \":)\".</p>\n<p>When posting or replying to messages, make sure you have something to say.\nThese empty posts\nclutter up threads and discussion, invalidate the 'Show New Posts' function, and waste bandwidth\nand server space.</p>\n<p>Threads that degenerate into a series of \"+1/-1\" or \"me too/I agree/I disagree\" will be locked.\nIndividual power posts may also be deleted.</p> Bumping\n<p>Posting a single word or useless message (bumping) to attract attention to your thread is not\nallowed.\nDo your own research, continue to troubleshoot, post the results, and be patient with the\ncommunity.\nIf people are reading your thread without answering or offering help, you may try\nsupplying more details, or ask to be pointed in the right direction.\nOften, the reason for posts\nremaining unanswered is due in large part to the sparse details in the original post itself, or,\nthe obvious availability of solutions in the wiki, on the forum or on the web, and the community's\nunwillingness to point out the obvious.</p> Cross-posting\n<p>Cross-posting is posting the same question multiple times in different subfora (for example,\nposting in both Newbie Corner and Installation), or posting slight variants of the question in the\nsame or different subfora.\nThis is a waste of resources and is not permitted.\nAny cross-posted\ntopic will be immediately locked and marked for deletion.</p> Thread hijacking\n<p>Thread hijacking is the process of replying to an existing thread with a different topic.\nThis is\ngenerally discouraged.\nIt is better to start a new thread if you have a problem that is related to\nan existing posted issue but clearly different.\nPosts that hijack a serious thread with off-topic\ndiscussion are also discouraged.</p> Dustbin policy (marked for deletion)\n<p>Threads that are locked/closed because they are either already documented on the boards or Wiki or\nare inconsistent with the Arch Way will be moved to Dust/troll-bin.\nAfter a period of five days,\nthe thread will be eligible for deletion at the discretion of the staff.\nThe Moderator responsible\nwill clearly mark the thread as \"Binned\" or \"For deletion.\"</p> Mailing lists\n<p>Guidelines for the mailing lists.\nSee also Mailing list\nposting style.</p> Top posting\n<p>There is never an excuse for top posting.\nDo not do it.</p> Quoting\n<p>Only quote the necessary elements from a previous email.\nBulk quoting quickly bloats threads and\nreduces the legibility while simultaneously increasing the cognitive load on the entire list.\nPrune\nall of the redundant material and just reply to the relevant quoted material.</p> Plain text\n<p>Plain text is the Unix and email standard.\nHTML is unnecessary and, for those using command line\nclients, unwelcome.\nKeep your line lengths reasonable: 72 characters is considered the default to\nwrap at.</p> AUR\n<p>Guidelines for the Arch User Repository can be found at\nAUR submission guidelines.</p> IRC\n<p>All Arch IRC channels are on the freenode\nIRC network.\nUsers on freenode must follow the network policy and\nfreenode channel guidelines.</p>\n<p>The official language of the <strong>#archlinux</strong> channel is English.\nIf you need help in another\nlanguage, search international arch channels.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>The main topic of #archlinux is support for and discussion about Arch Linux.</strong> General\nconversation on software and hardware is allowed so long as it does not interfere with the main\ntopic of discussion.\nIf you are asked to take something to another channel or private message you\nshould do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Read the channel topic on a regular basis with <code>/topic</code>.\nIt often contains important information.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There is only one official channel bot.\n<code>phrik!~archbot@archlinux/bot/phrik</code>.\nDo not spam bot\ncommands and limit your usage to things that are helpful.\nIf you want to bring your own bot into\nany Arch Linux channel, ask the operators before doing so.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not flood the channel with text.\nThis includes ASCII art, bot commands and error logs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Use a paste bin to share something longer than three lines</strong>.\n<code>program &amp;&gt.\nprogram-output.txt</code> in combination with pastebin clients can ease this\nstep.</li>\n<li>If you want to try out bot commands or look through the help function, then do it in a\n<code>/query</code> or <code>/msg</code>.\nExample: <code>/query phrik help &lt;command&gt;</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Auto-response in channel or in private message is not allowed with a single exception for away\nresponses at nick highlights in a private message.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not ask whether anyone is alive or uses your software, just state your question.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do not demand help.\nask for it.\nWait patiently for a few minutes before restating questions.\nMost\nquestions get answered by <em>just another user</em>, like you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When asking for help, always reply to people that ask you for more information, if you do not\nknow the answer then say so.</p>\n</li>\n</ul> Wiki\n<p>Guidelines for the wiki can be found in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ArchWiki:Contributing#The 3 fundamental rules</li>\n<li>Help:Style</li>\n<li>Help:Discussion</li>\n</ul> Bug tracker\n<p>Guidelines for the bug tracker can be found in\nBug reporting guidelines.</p> Enforcement\n<p>If the staff in any of the fora considers that a member's behaviour is unacceptable and warrants\nintervention, a warning will typically be issued unless the occurrence is judged to be especially\nflagrant, in which case a ban may be issued immediately.\nWarnings will not be discussed on the Arch\nForums, IRC channels, or mailing lists by the staff.\nIf the warning goes unheeded, further action\nwill be taken.\nThis may range from locking the offending user account, to deletion or banning of\nthe user, out of consideration for a peaceful forum and community.\nActions are usually conducted on\na case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Each of the fora has an appeal process and if someone feels they were unjustly dealt with, they are\nencouraged to plead their case for reinstatement through the appropriate channel (see below).</p> Contacting the staff\n<p>If you feel that an egregious oversight has been made, or if you need to alert the staff of any\nabusive behaviour, there are a number of ways you can ask for assistance or redress.\nThese include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For the Forums: use the \"Report\" button found below every text box, or email\nforum@archlinux.org to contact the forum admins.</li>\n<li>For the Wiki: contact the ArchWiki:Maintenance Team.</li>\n<li>For the IRC channels: contact one of the ops.</li>\n</ul> About this
