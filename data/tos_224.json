you that Bitly\u2019s customers share with Bitly.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that Bitly does not own or control, including other companies\u2019 websites, services and applications (\u201cThird Party Services\u201d) that you can access through the Services, such as Facebook or Twitter, or to individuals that Bitly does not manage or employ.\nWe cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you

industry, job title, company size and email address.\nIf you create an Account using your login from a third-party account, such as Google, Facebook or Twitter, we will access and collect the personal

platform, the name of the platform and your username on that platform.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When You Interact With a Bitly Link</strong>\n<br> Bitly automatically collects personal information about the

Party Services, we may collect information related to your use of those Third Party Services, such as authentication tokens that allow us to connect to your Third Party Service accounts.\nWe will ask you for permission before you authorize our collection of this information.\nWe will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.\nWe may also collect information about how you are using the Services to interact with those connected Third Party Services.\nNote that Third Party Services may have the ability to restrict the information that is provided to us based on your privacy settings of that account.</p>\n<p>To enable us to infer the location from the IP addresses of computers or devices that visit our website or click, view or interact with Bitly links as described in this policy, we receive IP-based location information from our third-party service provider.\nWe also receive business contact information of our business customer contacts and prospects from our third party service provider.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies and Other Similar Technologies</strong>\n<br> Bitly and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends,

Bitly Links you create, click or view.\n&nbsp;If you clear your cookies in your browser, you will need to click on the opt-out choice again after each time you clear your cookies.\nTo be clear, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.\nCookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications.\nHowever, on many mobile devices, application users may limit tracking via their device settings.\nPlease note that if you use these opt-out mechanisms, will still automatically collect the IP addresses of computers or mobile devices

for a variety of administrative and business purposes to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>operate our Site and provide the Services,</li>\n<li>process and complete any transactions,</li>\n<li>verify individual identity,</li>\n<li>respond to inquiries, questions and comments and provide customer and technical support,</li>\n<li>provide access to certain functionalities of our Services,</li>\n<li>personalize and improve the Services and develop new products and services,</li>\n<li>to communicate with our current and prospective customers concerning our services,</li>\n<li>measure interest and engagement in our Site and Services,</li>\n<li>monitor and analyze usage and trends of the Site and Services,</li>\n<li>provide services to our customers to allow them to understand how you interact with our Services and to help detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity,</li>\n<li>comply with any legal obligations, and</li>\n<li>enforce our terms and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Usage Across Devices</strong>\n<br> We may use the information we collect to make inferences that a unique individual has created or interacted with Bitly links on different devices so that we can to detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity and analyze how users use our Services.\n&nbsp;For example, if you created a Bitly link on a computer connected to your residential WiFi network, and you soon thereafter clicked on a Bitly link on a mobile device connected to the same WiFi network, we may infer that a single individual created and clicked on the Bitly links because both events were associated with the same IP address in the same time period.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Legitimate Interests</strong>\n<br> We also may use personal information to pursue legitimate interests, such as direct marketing, research (including marketing research), network and information security, prevention of fraudulent, malicious and unlawful activities, or any other purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide personal information or allowed by law.</p>Information We Share<p>The Services are designed to help you share information with others.\nIn addition, we provide Services to our Customers that use Bitly Link Metrics.\n&nbsp;As a result, some of the personal information generated through your use of the Services is shared publicly or with third parties as described below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bitly Links You Create</strong>\n<br> Much of your activity on and through the Services is public by default.\nFor example, when you create a Bitly Link, the original URLs you have shortened and the corresponding Bitly Links are publicly available.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Account Information</strong>\n<br> Where permitted by law, if you register a Bitly Account with an email address on a domain owned by an organization, (for example, an employer or educational institution where you have an email account), we may share your email address and information about your Account, such as the number of links you have created, with that organization to explore the organization\u2019s interest in creating or managing an enterprise account or for related purposes.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Share With Customers</strong>\n<br> We may share the personal information we collect as described in this Privacy Policy with our customers.\n&nbsp;When you create a Bitly Link of one of our enterprise customer\u2019s sites, the enterprise customer is able to view the unshortened original URL, the date and time the Bitly Link was created, the location where it was created as derived from your IP address, and aggregated information about clicks and views of the Bitly Links, including the number of times the Bitly Link was shared, whether or not it was viewed, comparison of that Bitly Links performance to that of all Bitly Links pointing to the same content, whether others are sharing a Bitly Link to the same content, geographic regions where the content is being viewed, and identification of social networks on which the Bitly Links appear.\n&nbsp;In addition, we may share Bitly Link Metrics with customers to help them detect, deter and prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information You Elect to Share</strong>\n<br> When creating a Bitly Link, you can share that Bitly Link through Third Party Services.\nAny information that you elect to distribute through Third Party Services, such as a social network post you create, may then become accessible to users of those services.\nYou can also access other Third Party Services through the Services, for example by clicking on links in the Statistics page for a Bitly Link.\nWe recommend that you review the terms of services and privacy policies of such Third Party Services that you access through the Services since Bitly does not control and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Shared with Service Providers </strong>\n<br> We may employ and contract with third parties to perform certain tasks on our behalf and under our direction (our \u201cService Providers\u201d).\nWe may need to share information about you with our Service Providers in order to provide our product with research and analytics on user behavior and to provide advertising products and services to users, to process payments, and to provide email marketing and support services.\nOur agreements with these Service Providers authorize them to use your information only as necessary to provide services to us.\n&nbsp;Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Disclosed Pursuant to Business Transfers</strong>\n<br> We may transfer and/or provide information about our users in connection with an acquisition, sale of company assets, or other situation where user information would be transferred as one of our business assets.\nYou will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website.</p>\n<p>In such a case, the acquirer of Bitly may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy or as otherwise allowed by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information Disclosed for the Protection of Bitly and Others</strong>\n<br> Bitly may access, read, preserve, and disclose any information it collects when it has a good faith belief that doing so is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with a law, regulation, or compulsory legal request, including process from a governmental law enforcement or national security agency, (ii) enforce the Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, deter, prevent or otherwise address malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Bitly, its users and the public.\nThis includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for protection from malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Information We Share With Your Consent</strong>\n<br> We will share information about you when you instruct us to do so, such as when you share Bitly Links or content with others through the Services or if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information (like sharing/posting it with a third-party Service).</p>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERSEU-U.S.\nPRIVACY SHIELD AND SWISS-U.S.\nPRIVACY SHIELD<p>Bitly, Inc.\nparticipates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework
