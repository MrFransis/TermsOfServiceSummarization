court in the\nstate of New York.\nYou expressly waive any defense or objection to venue or\npersonal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration/Dispute\nResolution.</b>&nbsp;You agree to\narbitrate any and all claims arising out of or related to the Agreement.\nIf you\nhave a dispute concerning any aspect of the Agreement, including without\nlimitation, your participation in the Rewards Program or a telemarketing call\nor SMS/text message that you received from us or a Marketing Partner, you\nshould first contact customer support on any of the Websites or complete a\ncustomer support ticket&nbsp;here.\nWe will attempt to resolve the matter to your satisfaction\nwithin thirty (30) days of our receipt of a customer support ticket.\nWe may\nchoose to provide you with a final written settlement offer during this\nprocess.\nIf we provide you with a final written settlement offer and you don't\naccept it, if we can't otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, or if you\nchoose to skip this step, you must submit your dispute for resolution by\narbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in\nthe county where you live by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration online by\nfollowing the instructions at&nbsp;https://apps.adr.org/webfile/.</p>\n<p>An AAA arbitrator will\nhave exclusive authority to resolve any dispute or claims that you may have\nwith us\u2014and our Marketing Partners who are third-party beneficiaries of the\nmandatory arbitration provision\u2014arising out of or related to the Agreement.\nMatters subject to mandatory arbitration include, without limitation, whether\nthis Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision applies to your particular claim\nor dispute, and any claim that all or any part of the Agreement, including this\nprovision, are/is unenforceable.\nIf the claim is against us, you will need our\nmailing address to file online.\nTo obtain our mailing address, contact us by clicking&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>Either party may\nsubmit the dispute for resolution by arbitration at a location reasonably\nconvenient to both parties.\nIf either party files for arbitration, it will be\nconducted in accordance with the then current AAA Consumer Arbitration\nRules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you proceed to\narbitration against us, you will pay all AAA filing fees and we will pay for\nall administration and arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that\nyour claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the\nstandards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nFor claims\nbrought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose\nwhether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone, or based only on\nsubmissions.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable\nrelief, including injunctive relief.\nAny award will be final and conclusive to\nthe parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nIf you\ninitiate arbitration against us and the arbitrator awards you relief that is\ngreater than our final written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was\nselected, then we will pay you a minimum recovery of Five Hundred Dollars\n($500.00), plus we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your\nattorney, if any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating,\npreparing, and pursuing the claim in arbitration.\nAlthough under some laws we\nmay have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in\narbitration, we agree that we will not seek such an award from you.\nYou and\nyour attorneys are not required to keep the results of the arbitration\nconfidential.\nYou agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit\nor to remove you as a participant in such a suit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Class Action Waiver.</b>&nbsp;The arbitration provision contained in\nthese Terms &amp.\nConditions does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights\nand remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in\nbinding arbitration as provided above.\nThis provision preventing you from\nbringing, joining, or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent\nagreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exceptions to\nMandatory Arbitration.&nbsp;</b>There are two narrow exceptions to mandatory arbitration.\nFirst,\nyou may opt-out of the Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision by providing\nwritten notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you\nfirst register on any of the Websites.\nTo obtain our mailing address, contact us\nby clicking&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>Second, you may choose\nto pursue your dispute or claim in Small Claims Court rather than by\narbitration, but only if your dispute or claim qualifies for Small Claims Court\nin a location where jurisdiction and venue over both you and RewardZone USA,\nLLC is proper.</p>\n<p>Other than these two\nexceptions, you must arbitrate any claims as provided above.</p>\n<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND\nAGREE THAT, VIA YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS, YOU\nWAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A
