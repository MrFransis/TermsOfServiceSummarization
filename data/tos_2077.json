privacy policy at https://www.libreoffice.org/privacy)\r\nI Name and address of the controller\r\n\r\nThe controller for the purpose of the EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and other national data protection laws of the Member States, as well as other data protection regulations, is:\r\n\r\nThe Document Foundation (TDF)\r\n\r\ngemeinn\u00fctzige, rechtsf\u00e4hige Stiftung des B\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts\r\n\r\nKurf\u00fcrstendamm 188\r\n\r\n10707 Berlin\r\n\r\nDeutschland\r\n\r\nTel.: +49 30 55579920\r\n\r\nEmail: info@documentfoundation.org\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://www.documentfoundation.org\r\nII General information about data processing\r\n1.Extent of the processing of personal data\r\n\r\nWe collect and use personal information from our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website, content and services. The collection and use of personal data from our users takes place only with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for factual reasons, and processing the data is permitted by law.\r\n2.Legal basis for the processing of personal data\r\n\r\nWhen we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.\r\n\r\nWhen processing personal data necessary for completing a contract, in which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.\r\n\r\nWhen the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our foundation is subjected, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.\r\n\r\nIn the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d of the GDPR serves as the legal basis.\r\n\r\nIf processing is necessary to safeguard the factual interests of our foundation or a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh those interests, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing.\r\n3.Deletion of data and storage duration\r\n\r\nThe personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the reason for storage expires. In addition, data storage may occur when required by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Restriction or deletion of data also occurs when a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for longer storage of the data, for entering or fulfilment of a contract.\r\nIII Accessing the website and creation of log files\r\n1.Description and extent of data processing\r\n\r\nEach time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the requesting computer. The following data is collected:\r\n\r\n    Information about the user's web browser and its version;\r\n\r\n    The user's operating system;\r\n\r\n    The user's IP address;\r\n\r\n    The date and time of access;\r\n\r\n    Websites from which the user's system reaches our website;\r\n\r\n    Websites that are accessed by the user's system through our website.\r\n\r\nThe data is also stored in our systems' log files. Storage of this data together with other personal data of the user does not occur.\r\n2.Legal basis for data processing\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nTemporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to deliver the website to the user's computer. To do this, the user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.\r\n\r\nStorage in log files occurs to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data is used to optimise the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. Analysis of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.\r\n\r\nFor these purposes, our factual interest in the processing of data is according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.\r\n4.Duration of storage\r\n\r\nThe data will be deleted as soon as it is not needed to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. In the case of data collection used to providing the website, this takes place when the respective session is completed.\r\n\r\nFor data storage in log files, this takes place after fourteen days at the latest. Longer storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or obfuscated, so that linking the data to the requesting client is no longer possible.\r\n5.Option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nThe collection of data for accessing the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no option for users to opt-out of this data collection.\r\nIV Usage of cookies\r\n1.Description and extent of data processing\r\n\r\nOur website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in or by the web browser on the user's computer systems. When a user visits a website, a cookie may be stored in the user's operating system. This cookie contains a characteristic string that allows the browser to be uniquely identified when the website is revisited.\r\n\r\nWe use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some elements of our website require that the requesting browser can be identified even across multiple sessions. Only a random ID is stored in the cookie and transmitted.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some services offered through our web servers use cookies to store custom settings across sessions. These are in particular: Jitsi (the specified user name is stored), OpenGrok (search preferences), WordPress (user name, URL and email address) and EtherPad (user name and text colour assigned to it). It is not necessary to provide a username in order to use these services.\r\n\r\nWhen accessing our website, users are informed by a banner about the use of cookies for analysis purposes, and users are referred to this privacy policy. In this context, there is also information of how browser settings can be changed to prevent the storage of cookies.\r\n2.Legal basis for data processing\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nThe reason for using cookies is to simplify the use of the websites. Some features of our website cannot be provided without the use of cookies. For these, it is necessary that the browser can be recognized across multiple sessions.\r\n\r\nWe require cookies for the following:\r\n\r\n    To keep logins active.\r\n\r\n    To preserve individual settings such as user names or search preferences.\r\n\r\nThe user data collected via those technically necessary cookies will not be used to create user profiles.\r\n\r\nFor these purposes, our factual interest in the processing of personal data is pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR.\r\n4.Duration of storage, and option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nCookies are stored on the users's computer and transmitted by the computer to our website. Therefore, as a user, you have full control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your web browser, you can disable or restrict the transmission of cookies. Cookies that have been saved already can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If cookies are disabled for our website, it may though not be possible to use all the features of our website in full.\r\nV Notifications and mailing lists\r\n1.Description and extent of data processing\r\n\r\nOur website provides the opportunity to subscribe to free notification services or mailing lists. When a user signs up for the notification service or a mailing list, the data from the registration dialog or the email is sent to us, such as the email address being used. In addition, the following data is collected upon registration:\r\n\r\n    IP address of the requesting computer\r\n\r\n    Date and time of the registration confirmation\r\n\r\nFor processing the data, your consent is obtained during the registration process and a reference is made to this privacy policy.\r\n\r\nRegarding data processing used to send notifications or emails from a mailing list, no transfer of the data to third parties takes place. The data will be used exclusively for sending notifications or emails from a mailing list.\r\n2.Legal basis for data processing\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for processing data after registration by the user is the consent from the user, according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nThe collection of the user's email address serves to deliver notifications or emails from the mailing list. The collection of the date and time of the registration confirmation serves as proof of registration (opt-in).\r\n4.Duration of storage\r\n\r\nThe data will be deleted as soon as it is not needed to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. The date of the registration confirmation and the email address of the user will be stored for as long as the subscription to the notifications or mailing list is active. Other personal data collected during the registration process will normally be deleted after a period of five weeks.\r\n5.Option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nSubscriptions to notifications or mailing lists can be terminated by the affected user at any time. For this purpose, there is detailed information in every notification or email.\r\nVI Registration\r\n1.Description and extent of data processing\r\n\r\nOn our website, we offer users the opportunity to register by providing personal information (for example: Bugzilla, the wiki, WebSingleSignOn, Pootle, AskBot). The data is entered into a dialog box, and transmitted to us and stored. A transfer of data to third parties does not take place. The following data is collected as part of the registration process: a username, and an email address. Details like the name (\"real name\") or further personal information is always voluntary.\r\n\r\nAt the time of registration, the following data is also stored:\r\n\r\n    The user's IP address\r\n\r\n    The date and time when the registration took place\r\n\r\nAs part of the registration process, the user's consent to process this data is obtained.\r\n2.Legal basis for data processing\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for processing the data is the consent of the user, according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nUser registration is required for the provision of certain content and services on our website.\r\n\r\nFor specific notification of the user's changes;\r\n\r\nTo prevent abuse;\r\n4.Duration of storage\r\n\r\nThe data will be deleted as soon as it is not needed to achieve the purposes for which it was collected.\r\n\r\nThis is the case for the data collected during the registration process when the registration on our website is canceled or modified.\r\n5.Option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nAs a user, you have the option to cancel the registration at any time. You can change or modify the data stored about you at any time. You will find this information in the confirmation email for your application, as well as on the login page of the service. An email with relevant information to privacy@documentfoundation.org is also sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII Email contact\r\n1.Description and extent of data processing\r\n\r\nOn our website, it is possible to contact us via the provided email address. In this case, the user's personal data transmitted by email will be stored.\r\n\r\nThere is no disclosure of the data to third parties. The data is used exclusively to process the conversation.\r\n2.Legal basis for data processing\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for processing the data is consent of the user, according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR.\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for processing the data that is transmitted when sending an email is Article 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR. If the email contact aims to conclude a contract, then the additional legal basis for processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nThe processing of personal data of the contact via email serves only for processing the communication.\r\n4.Duration of storage\r\n\r\nThe data will be deleted as soon as it is not needed to achieve the purposes for which it was collected. This is the case for personal data sent by email, if the respective email is no longer required. In addition, statutory storage requirements may apply.\r\n5.Option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nThe user has the option \u2013 at any time \u2013 to revoke his consent to the processing of his personal data. If the user contacts us by email, he may object to the storage of his personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation can not continue. All you need to do is send an mail with relevant information to privacy@documentfoundation.org.\r\n\r\nAll personal data stored in the course of communication will be deleted in this case.\r\nVIII Web analytics via Matomo\r\n1.Extent of processing of personal data\r\n\r\nOn our website, we use the open-source software tool Matomo (formerly Piwik) to analyse the browsing behaviour of our users. This software creates a cookie on the computer of the users (for details about cookies, see above). When individual pages of our website are accessed, the following data is stored:\r\n\r\n    Two bytes of the IP address of the user's system\r\n\r\n    The website that is accessed\r\n\r\n    The website which led the user to access our website (referrer)\r\n\r\n    The subpages that accessed from the website that was accessed\r\n\r\n    The session duration on the website (how long the user accesses it)\r\n\r\n    How often the website is accessed\r\n\r\nThe software runs exclusively on our website's servers. Storage of personal data only takes place there. Transfer of the data to third parties does not take place.\r\n\r\nThe software is configured such that the IP addresses are not stored completely, but two bytes of the IP address are masked (eg 192.168.xxx.xxx). In this way, it is no longer possible to associate the shortened IP address with the requesting computer.\r\n2.Legal basis for the processing of personal data\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for processing users' personal data is Article 6 (1) lit. f of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nThe processing of users' personal data enables us to analyse the browsing behaviour of our users. By analysing the obtained data, we are able to compile information about the use of individual parts of our website. This helps us to constantly improve our website and its user-friendliness. For these purposes, our factual interest lies in the processing of the data according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f of the GDPR. The anonymisation of the IP address takes into account the interests of users regarding protection of their personal data.\r\n4.Duration of storage\r\n\r\nThe data will be deleted as soon as is is no longer required for our recording purposes. In our case, this takes place after 180 days.\r\n5.Option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nOn the site https://www.documentfoundation.org/privacy, we offer our users the option to opt out of the analysis process. For this, you must follow the appropriate link. In this way, another cookie is set on your system, which tells our systems to not save the user's data. If the user deletes the corresponding cookie in the meantime from his own system, he must set the opt-out cookie again.\r\nIX Payment service providers\r\n1.Extent of processing of personal data\r\n\r\nOn our website, we offer the opportunity to make a donation to us. We use external payment service providers whose platforms allow users to make payment transactions to us - e.g. (in parenthesis the link to the privacy policy): Paypal (https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full?locale.x=en_GB#Updated_PS), Stripe (https://stripe.com/privacy), CoinGate (https://coingate.com/privacy), BitPay (https://bitpay.com/about/privacy), Flattr (https://flattr.com/privacy), Visa (https://usa.visa.com/legal/privacy-policy.html), Mastercard (https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/about-mastercard/what-we-do/privacy.html). For these purposes, data is transmitted to the selected financial service provider. These are:\r\n\r\n    the IP address of the user's system;\r\n\r\n    the chosen amount and currency;\r\n\r\n    the website from which the donator initiated the donation;\r\n\r\n    whether the donation is a one-off, or recurring;\r\n\r\n    (optionally) the email address of the donator.\r\n\r\n2.Legal basis for the processing of personal data\r\n\r\nThe legal basis for the processing of the data is the consent of the user, according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR.\r\n3.Reason for data processing\r\n\r\nThe processing serves to process a donation by an external financial service provider.\r\n4.Duration of storage\r\n\r\nThe data will be deleted after it is sent to the financial service provider.\r\n5.Option to object and remove data\r\n\r\nSince the process is triggered by the user himself and the data associated with it is deleted immediately thereafter, there is no option to opt-out or delete on our part.\r\nX Integration of third party services\r\n1.Type and extent\r\n\r\nOur websites use third party services. They are integrated dynamically into web pages. These services can set cookies from the respective providers on your computer, and also execute JavaScript code.\r\n1.1.Use of Google Maps\r\n\r\nOn our websites, we use the \"Google Maps\" component from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereafter referred to as \"Google\".\r\n\r\nEach time Google Maps is accessed, Google sets a cookie to process user settings and data when viewing the page that has the Google Maps component integrated. This cookie is usually not deleted by closing the browser, but it will expire after a certain amount of time unless it is manually deleted by you.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree with the processing of your data, you may disable the \"Google Maps\" service and prevent the transmission of data to Google in this way. To do this, you must disable the JavaScript feature in your browser. However, please note that in this case you will not be able to use \"Google Maps\" at all, or only to a limited extent.\r\n\r\nUse of \"Google Maps\" and information obtained through \"Google Maps\" is subject to the Google Terms of Use:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/terms/regional.html\r\n\r\nand the additional terms and conditions for \"Google Maps\":\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/intl/de_de/help/terms_maps.html.\r\n1.2.Use of reCAPTCHA\r\n\r\nTo protect data entry forms on our websites, we use the service \"reCAPTCHA\" from Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereafter referred to as \"Google\". Through the use of this service, it can be determined whether the corresponding input is from a human, or the form is being abused by automated machine processing.\r\n\r\nTo our knowledge, the following are transferred to \"Google\": referrer URL, the IP address, the behaviour of the website visitors, information about the operating system, browser and duration, cookies, presentation instructions and scripts, the input behaviour of the user and mouse movements in the \"reCAPTCHA\" checkbox.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Google uses this information to digitize books and other printed materials, as well as to optimize services such as Google Street View and Google Maps (eg house number and street name recognition).\r\n\r\nThe IP address submitted as part of \"reCAPTCHA\" will not be merged with any other data provided by Google, unless you are logged in to your Google Account at the time you use the \"reCAPTCHA\" plug-in. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data about you and your behaviour on our website by \"Google\", you must log out of \"Google\" before you visit our site or use the reCAPTCHA plug-in.\r\n\r\nUse of the information obtained by the \"reCAPTCHA\" service is in accordance with the Google Terms of Use:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/.\r\n1.3.Use of Twitter Recommendation Component\r\n\r\nWe use components from the Twitter service on our websites. Twitter is a service of Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, United States.\r\n\r\nEach time you visit our websites which contain such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component of Twitter. Through this process, Twitter is informed about which specific page of our website is currently being visited.\r\n\r\nWe have no control over the information that Twitter collects here, nor about the amount of data collected by Twitter. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of the respective website and the user's IP address, but it is not used for purposes other than the presentation of the Twitter component. Further information can be found in the privacy policy of Twitter at http://twitter.com/privacy.\r\n\r\nYou can change your privacy settings in the Account Settings at http://twitter.com/account/settings.\r\n1.4.Use of YouTube components with advanced privacy mode\r\n\r\nOn our websites, we use components (videos) from the company YouTube, LLC 901 Cherry Ave., 94066 San Bruno, CA, a company of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.\r\n\r\nHere we use the option provided by YouTube \"- extended privacy mode -\".\r\n\r\nWhen you visit a page that has an embedded video, it will connect to the YouTube servers and display the content by notifying your browser on the website.\r\n\r\nAccording to information provided by YouTube, in \"- enhanced privacy mode -\" data is only transmitted to the YouTube server when watching the video, in particular which of our web pages you have visited. If you are logged in to YouTube at the same time, this information will be associated with your membership account on YouTube. You can prevent this by logging out of your account before visiting our website.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about YouTube's privacy is provided by Google at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/privacy/\r\n1.5.Use of Vimeo components\r\n\r\nWe use components of the Vimeo service on our website. Vimeo is a service of Vimeo LCC, 555 West 18th Street, NY, New York 10011, USA. Each time you visit a web page which has such a component, this component causes the browser you are using to download a corresponding representation of the component from Vimeo. When you visit our site and you are logged in to Vimeo, Vimeo recognises, through the information gathered by the component, which specific site you are visiting and assigns this information to your personal Vimeo account. If, for instance, you click the \"Play\" button or leave a comment, this information will be transmitted to your personal Vimeo account and stored there.
