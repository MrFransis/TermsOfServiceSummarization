associated with specific Internet protocol addresses (each a \"GeoIP Database\" and collectively the \"GeoIP Databases\").\nThe data available through the GeoIP Databases is referred to in this Agreement as the \"GeoIP Data\".\n</li>\n<li> \u201cminFraud Service\u201d refers to the service offered by MaxMind that uses MaxMind proprietary data combined with recognized fraud risks to help merchants identify potentially fraudulent online transactions.\n</li>\n<li> \u201cGeoIP2 Precision Service\u201d refers to the service offered by MaxMind that uses MaxMind proprietary data to provide geolocation and other information associated with an IP address.\n</li>\n<li> \u201cServices\u201d as used in this Agreement encompasses the GeoIP Databases and the GeoIP Data therein, the minFraud Services and the GeoIP2 Precision Services.\n</li>\n<li> \"Web Services\" refers to the minFraud Service and the GeoIP2 Precision Service.\nThe GeoIP Databases are not \u201cWeb Services.\u201d Unless otherwise specified, all references to the Services in this Agreement include the Web Services.\n</li>\n<li> \"Geolocation Functionality\" includes, but is not limited to, the distribution of content based on geographic location, any ability to view the GeoIP Data, any ability to view or access graphical or textual representations of the GeoIP data, and any ability to initiate queries to the GeoIP Databases directly or via your commercial product/service.\n</li>\n<li> a \"ShopID\" is an input for a query to the minFraud Service.\nThe ShopID is your internal identification code or name for the shop, affiliate, merchant, or customer that is the source of the online transaction for which the minFraud Service is being queried.\n</li>\n<li> \"Internal Restricted Business Purpose(s)\" means the uses of the GeoIP Data solely for content customization, fraud prevention, and geographic reporting provided that \"Internal Restricted Business Purposes\" does not include: <ol>\n<li> providing Geolocation Functionality to applications or online platforms if users other than you can access or use the Geolocation Functionality for their own purposes or benefit (e.g., you may use Geolocation Functionality to customize and target your own ads for your own products and services, surveys, and other content but may not use Geolocation Functionality in connection with a service that customizes or targets any content on behalf of your customers, users, or any third party).\n</li>\n<li> using GeoIP Data in the models or decision-making process for a fraud-detection or similar service offered to third parties, regardless of whether end users of the service and other third parties are able to view or otherwise access the GeoIP Data.\n</li>\n<li> sharing the GeoIP Data with third parties.\nAs an illustration, restrictions on sharing GeoIP Data include, but are not limited to, (X) displaying geolocation pairing information (meaning displaying an IP address along with its geographic origination such as \"this IP address, XXX.XX.XX.XX, originates from New York City, NY, USA\").\nand (Y) displaying GeoIP Data in an aggregated format such as \"1000 IP addresses originated

You may access and use the Services for your own Internal Restricted Business Purposes.\n</li>\n<li> You may use the Web Services (but not the GeoIP Databases) to provide Geolocation Functionality for applications or products, even if such applications or products are accessible to parties other than you or your employees (Note: You may use the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data to provide Geolocation Functionality for applications or products only if those applications and products are accessible only to you and your employees.) </li>\n<li> You may sublicense the Web Services (but not the GeoIP Databases) to your customers provided that (i) all use by you and your customers of the Web Services complies with the terms and restrictions set forth in this Agreement (including the minFraud Service Terms of Use, if applicable) and (ii) any query to the minFraud Service made by you, or on behalf of your customer, includes a ShopID as an input field.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nYou agree to use the Services and products only in a manner that is consistent\nwith applicable laws.\nYou understand and agree that (i) MaxMind does not\nguarantee the accuracy of the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data.\nand (ii) you are\nsolely responsible for the legality of your use and receipt of the Services.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nRESTRICTIONS.\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>General.</u> You may not, nor may you permit others to: <ol>\n<li> copy any portion of the Services except as reasonably required for using the Services as permitted in this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li> allow anyone other than yourself or your employees to access the Services, or any portion thereof, without MaxMind's express written permission or except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li> use the Services to develop a database, infobase, or similar database service, or other information resource in any media (print, electronic, or otherwise, now existing or developed in the future) for sale to, distribution to, display to, or use by others.\n</li>\n<li> except as explicitly permitted hereunder for your use of the Web Services, create compilations or derivative works of the Services for any purpose other than your own Internal Restricted Business Purposes.\n</li>\n<li> use the Services in any manner that is beyond the scope of the rights granted in this Agreement.\n</li>\n<li> except as explicitly permitted hereunder for your use of the Web Services, store in a retrieval system accessible to the public, transfer, publish, distribute, display to others, broadcast, sell, or sublicense the Services, or any portion thereof.\n</li>\n<li> remove or obscure any copyright notice or other notice or terms of use contained in the Services.\n</li>\n<li> use the Services to create or otherwise

than you or your employees.\nor </li>\n<li> use the Services for the purpose of identifying or locating a specific individual or household.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Disclosure of GeoIP Database and GeoIP Data.</u> you will not disclose the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data to any third party except as explicitly permitted by this Agreement or after notifying MaxMind of the anticipated disclosure and obtaining MaxMind's prior written consent to the disclosure.\nTo the extent you disclose the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data to a third party as permitted by this Agreement, you will impose upon the third party the same or substantially similar contractual duties imposed on you and the rights provided to MaxMind as in this Agreement, including those in Section 3 (Limited Grant Of Rights), Section 4 (Restrictions), and the Addendum.\nYou are responsible for the acts or omissions of any third parties with which you share the GeoIP Databases or GeoIP Data.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>Destruction of GeoIP Database and GeoIP Data.</u> From time to time, MaxMind will release an updated version of the GeoIP Databases, and you agree to promptly use the updated version of the GeoIP Databases.\nYou shall cease use of and destroy (i) any old versions of the GeoIP Databases and GeoIP Data within thirty (30) days following the release of the updated GeoIP Databases.\nand (ii) all GeoIP Databases and GeoIP Data immediately upon termination of the license under this Agreement.\nUpon request, you shall provide MaxMind with written confirmation of such destruction.\n</li>\n<li>\n<u>FCRA</u> In addition, the parties understand and agree that MaxMind is not a consumer reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\u00a71681 et seq.\n(\"FCRA\"), and that the Services do not constitute \"consumer reports\" as defined in the FCRA.\nYou understand that any information you provide to MaxMind in order to use the Services has not been collected by MaxMind for credit purposes and is not intended to be indicative of any consumer's credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, or other characteristics listed in Section 603(d) of the FCRA.\nYou agree that you will not use the Services or any information received through the Services in whole or in part (i) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for credit, (ii) as a factor in establishing a consumer's eligibility for insurance, (iii) for employment purposes, (iv) in connection with a determination of an individual's eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental authority, or (v) in connection with any permissible purpose as defined by the FCRA.\nAny use of the Services by you in violation of this paragraph shall also constitute an unacceptable use.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\nACCURACY EXPECTATION: NO USE OF THE GEOIP DATA OR GEOIP2 PRECISION SERVICES FOR IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC HOUSEHOLDS OR INDIVIDUALS.\n<p>\nDue to the nature of geolocation technology and other factors beyond its\ncontrol, MaxMind cannot and does not guarantee the accuracy of the Services.\nThe GeoIP Databases and GeoIP2 Precision Services contain only the geographic data available and the\navailability of such data is not consistent for all regions.\nFurthermore, none\nof the Services reliably identifies any geographic level or division more\nprecise than the zip code or postal code associated with an IP address.\nAccordingly, it is imperative that MaxMind's customers not rely on the GeoIP\nData or GeoIP2 Precision Services to identify a specific household, individual, or street address.\nYou\nacknowledge the foregoing limitation of the Services and you will not\nuse or encourage others to use the Services for the purpose of identifying or\nlocating a specific household, individual, or street address.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li> NON-DISCLOSURE OF MINFRAUD SERVICE OUTPUTS.\n<p>\nExcept as explicitly provided in this Agreement, you may not, nor may you permit others to, disclose to any customer or other third party any output returned by the minFraud Service (e.g., such response\nvalues as the riskScore, proxyScore or proxy score, IP Risk Score, subscores,\nhigh risk flags), recognizing that the confidentiality of such information is\nvital to the performance of the minFraud service.\nDisclosure of such\ninformation shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement.\nFor the removal of doubt, you may provide outputs returned by the minFraud Service to customers to whom you have sublicensed the minFraud Service, but you may not provide any minFraud Service outputs to any individual whose transaction was evaluated by the minFraud Service.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nOWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n<p>\nYou acknowledge and agree that MaxMind's trade secrets include the Services.\nYou further acknowledge and agree that\n(a) all intellectual property rights including copyrights, moral rights,\ntrademarks, trade secrets, and proprietary rights to the Services are\nexclusively owned by MaxMind and (b) you obtain no right, title, or interest\ntherein.\nYou hereby assign to MaxMind all copyrights, intellectual property\nrights, and any other proprietary or property rights or interests in and to any\nwork created in violation of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\nMaxMind's successful maintenance and operation of the Services require that it\nstore, retain, and utilize data that is submitted to it by customers who use\nthe Services.\nAccordingly, and to the extent that any data submitted to\nMaxMind by you is protectable by copyright, moral rights, or any similar\nintellectual property laws in any jurisdiction, you hereby assign and agree to\nassign to MaxMind all right, title, and interest in and to such data and/or the\naggregated product of such data.\nTo the extent that you are legally or\ncontractually unable to assign the foregoing rights of ownership, then you\nhereby grant to MaxMind a fully paid-up, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable\nlicense to use, copy, distribute, make derivative works, and otherwise\ncommercially exploit all such data in connection with MaxMind's business.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, MaxMind shall comply with the terms of its own\nPrivacy Policy in place at the time of submission of any data to MaxMind.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION <ol>\n<li> \u201cConfidential Information\u201d includes all confidential and proprietary information or material disclosed by you or MaxMind (the \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d) to the other party (the \u201cReceiving Party\u201d) from which the Disclosing Party derives actual or potential economic value, and which is clearly marked or verbally identified at the time of disclosure as \u201cConfidential\u201d or is disclosed or learned under circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the information was confidential.\nConfidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is or becomes publicly known through no act or omission of the Receiving Party.\n(ii) was in the Receiving Party\u2019s lawful possession before being disclosed to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party.\n(iii) is lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by any other third party not bound by any confidentiality obligation with respect to such information.\nor (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party.\n</li>\n<li> The parties acknowledge that each party may have access to Confidential Information of the other party.\nEach party shall use reasonable care to protect the Confidential Information of the other party.\nIn that regard, each party shall restrict access to Confidential Information to employees, contractors, and third parties as is reasonably required to exercise its rights and fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and only if such persons are subject to nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement.\nNeither party shall, without prior written approval of the other party, use for such party\u2019s own benefit, publish, copy, or otherwise disclose to others, or permit the use by others for their benefit or to the detriment of the Disclosing Party, any Confidential Information.\nThe Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party if required to do so under applicable law, rule or order, provided that the Receiving Party, where reasonably practicable and to the extent legally permissible, provides the Disclosing Party with prior written notice of the required disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, and provided further that the Receiving Party discloses no more Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party than is reasonably necessary in order to respond to the required disclosure.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>PERSONAL DATA.\n<p>\nThe parties hereby agree to and incorporate by reference the Addendum, which shall apply to the extent the parties\nprocess any Personal Information (as defined in the Addendum) in connection with\nyour use of the Services.\nThe provisions of the Addendum relating to the processing of Personal Information (as defined in the Addendum) shall control over any conflicting provisions elsewhere in this Agreement.\nFor the removal of doubt, the Addendum is subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nSECURITY.\n<p>\nYou will maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational\nmeasures for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of\nany information you receive from MaxMind including without limitation, from the Services (including protection against\nunauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental or unlawful\ndestruction, loss, or alteration or damage, unauthorized disclosure of, or\naccess to, such data).\nIn the event you discover a data incident involving any\nsuch information, you shall promptly notify MaxMind and fully cooperate with\nMaxMind, at your own expense, in remediating the incident.\nYou are responsible\nfor all activities that occur under your password, license key, and similar\nmechanisms for account access (collectively \"Passwords\"), and shall keep your\nPasswords confidential.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nINDEMNIFICATION.\n<p>\nYou will indemnify and hold MaxMind and its affiliates harmless from and against\nany and all claims, causes of action, liabilities, penalties,

Addendum.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nFEES.\n<p>\nMaxMind's current fee schedule for using the Services is posted on the Website.\nUnless MaxMind has agreed in writing to alternative fees for your account,

distributed with\nsuch APIs or their associated software or documentation.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\nCHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT/TERMINATION.\n<ol>\n<li> MaxMind may amend this Agreement at any time.\nAny such amendment(s) shall be binding and effective upon the earlier of (i) the date that is thirty (30) days after the posting of the amended Agreement on the Website or (ii) the date that MaxMind provides notice to you of the amended Agreement, except that changes to charges and payment terms may be made only upon 30 days' prior written notice to you.\nYou may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to MaxMind if a change is unacceptable to you.\nYour continued use of the Services following notice to you of a change shall constitute your acceptance of the change.\n</li>\n<li> If

otherwise appearing or referenced on such form will be applicable to or shall modify or change your rights or obligations hereunder except for those terms and conditions concerning specific details with respect to matters such as date, location, and quantity provided that such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.\nMaxMind reserves
