the event that allowed the damage to occur.</p> Social Media Tools <p>Couchsurfing may offer social sharing features or other integrated tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other media, and vice versa.\nThe use of such features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that

the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites and better understand your online activity.\nPlease note that we may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in a hashed, non-human readable form, with these third parties.\nFor example, we may engage a third party data provider who may collect web log data from you or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads or content.\nThese cookies may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to information you voluntarily provide to us (e.g., an email address) in a hashed, non-human readable form.\nFor more information about interest-based ads, or to opt out of having your web

checkout process.</p> 3.\nINTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS <p>3.1 You Have Sole Responsibility When Interacting with Other Members.\nOur Services provide a platform for members to learn about one another, arrange stays and travel, engage in activities and communicate with one another.\nCouchsurfing is not a party to, has no involvement or interest in, makes no representations or warranties as to, and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transactions, interactions, disputes or any relations whatsoever between you and any other member, person or organization.\nYou are solely responsible for your interactions with other members of our Services.\nWe reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between you and other members of our Services.</p>\n<p>Remember, the Couchsurfing Services are just a platform that enable you to communicate and interact with other people around the world.\nWe cannot be responsible for the interactions that you have with other Couchsurfing members, so please use good judgment and keep safety in mind when you use our Services.</p>\n<p>3.2 Identity Verification.\nWe cannot and do not confirm each member\u2019s identity.\nAlthough we provide tools intended to assist with identity verification, such as our address verification tool (as described in Section 3.3), you are solely responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may interact through our Services.\nCouchsurfing does not represent or warrant that our tools are sufficient to determine whether it is appropriate for you to interact with another member.\nFurther, we do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services.\nWe do not investigate or verify any member\u2019s reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or any information members may submit to the Services (other than the address-verification tool as described in Section 3.3).\nWe encourage you to take precautions when interacting with other members, particularly when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.</p>\n<p>3.3 Our Address-Verification Tool.\nOur address verification tool is intended merely to confirm that the postal address a member submits to us is an address at which that member is able to access or receive mail.\nCouchsurfing\u2019s address verification tool is not intended to confirm that a member actually resides at a particular address.\nWhile this is one of many ways to reduce the risk of misconduct by a member, it is not a guarantee of any member\u2019s identity or good faith.</p>\n<p>3.4 Member-Hosted Events.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors.\nMembers may organize in-person meetings and host events for other Couchsurfing members.\nhowever, these events are not sponsored or endorsed by Couchsurfing and members attend such meetings and events at their own risk.\nIn addition, Couchsurfing members may sign up to become Couchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) and contribute their time to activities that support the Couchsurfing community, such as meeting new members, organizing events and answering questions.\nCouchsurfing Ambassadors (or members of a successor program) are not agents of Couchsurfing and Couchsurfing is not responsible or liable for any acts or omissions of these members.</p>\n<p>3.5 Release.\nBecause our Services are merely a platform, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more members, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.\nIf you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: \u201cA general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\u201d</p> 4.\nMEMBER CONDUCT AND CONTENT <p>The Services include interactive areas where you or other members can create, post or store content, messages, materials, data, information, text, music, sound, photos, videos, graphics or other items or materials on the Services (collectively, \u201cMember Content\u201d).\nYou are solely responsible for your use of such interactive areas and agree that your use of these areas is at your own risk.</p>\n<p>4.1 Member Content Restrictions.\nYou are solely responsible for any Member Content that you submit, post or

any Member Content without notice.\nIf you become aware of Member Content that violates these Terms, you may notify of us such content by using the reporting tools provided on our Services.\nEnforcement of these Terms, however, is solely in our discretion and the absence of enforcement in some instances does not waive of our right to enforce the Terms in other instances.\nIn addition, these Terms do not create a private right of action on the part of any third party or any reasonable expectation that the Services will not contain any content that is prohibited by such rules.</p>\n<p>4.2 Member Conduct.\nBy accessing or using the Services, you agree to act responsibly, exercise good judgment and comply with the Community Guidelines.\nIn addition, you agree not

<p>\n<strong>14.1.\nMembership:</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Your Couchsurfing contributions will continue and automatically renew until terminated.\nTo use the Couchsurfing service you must have Internet access and provide us with one or more Contribution Methods.\n\"Contribution Method\" means a current, valid, accepted method of contributing, as may be updated from time to time and which may include contributing through your account with a third party.\nYou must cancel your Couchsurfing contributions before they renew in order to avoid contributing your Couchsurfing contribution for the next contribution cycle to your Contribution Method (see \"Cancellation\" below).</p>\n<p>We may offer a number of contribution plans, including special promotional plans or contributions offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services.\nWe are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.\nSome membership contribution plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you.\nYou can find specific details regarding your Couchsurfing membership by logging into your account and navigating to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>14.2.\nBilling and Cancellation: </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contribution Cycle.</strong> The Couchsurfing member contribution and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Contribution Method on the next contribution date indicated on \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page.\nThe length of your contribution cycle will depend on the type of contribution plan that you choose when you sign-up for as a member of Couchsurfing.\nContributions are fully earned upon payment.\nIn some cases your contribution date may change, for example if your Contribution Method has not successfully settled or if your membership began on a day not contained in a given month.\nVisit our website and go to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page to see your next contribution date.\nWe may authorize your Contribution Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Contribution Methods.</strong> To use the Couchsurfing service you must provide one or more Contribution Methods.\nYou authorize us to charge any Contribution Method associated to your account in case your primary Contribution Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your membership contribution.\nYou remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.\nIf a contribution is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your contributions, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Contribution Method.\nFor some Contribution Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Contribution Method.\nCheck with your Contribution Method service provider for details.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Updating your Contribution Methods.</strong> You can update your Contribution Methods by contacting our Support Team.\nWe may also update your Contribution Methods using information provided by the payment service providers.\nFollowing any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Contribution Method(s).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cancellation.</strong> You can cancel your Couchsurfing contributions at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Couchsurfing service through the end of your contribution period.\nTo cancel, please contact our Support Team.\nIf you cancel your contributions, your account will be accessible until the end of your current contribution period.\nTo see when your contribution period expires, go to \"Membership &amp.\nContributions\" on the \"Account &amp.\nSettings\" page.\nIf you signed up for Couchsurfing using your account with a third party, such as Paypal, as a Contribution Method and wish to cancel your Couchsurfing contributions, you may need to do so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or cancelling your contributions to the Couchsurfing service through that third party.\nYou may also find contribution information about your Couchsurfing contributions by visiting your account with the applicable third party.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Changes to the Price and Contributions Plans.</strong> We reserve the right to change our contribution plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your contribution plan will take effect following notice to you.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>No Refunds.</strong> Contributions are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.\nFollowing any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current contribution period.\nAt any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (\"credits\").\nThe amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion.\nThe provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.\n</p> 15.\nMEMBER\u2019S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES <p>15.1.\nYou hereby represent and warrant that you have the full power and authority to enter into and perform
