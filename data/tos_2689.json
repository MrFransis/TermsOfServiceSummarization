yourself!</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You must carefully read this User Agreement in its entirety before using our Service.\nThis is a legally binding Agreement between you and Chess.com.\nIt incorporates the Fair Play Policy, Privacy Policy, Subscriber Agreement, and Community Policy.</p>\n<p>By using our service you agree to the terms in this User Agreement.\nIf you do not agree, then you should not use our Service.\n</p>\n<p>To enter into this Agreement, you must be an adult of legal age in your state or country of residence.\nIf you enter into this Agreement, then you are affirming that you have reached the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction and we are permitted to reasonably rely on that.\nIf you are not of legal age, then your parent or legal guardian must consent to this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>All of these policies may be updated or modified from time to time.\nso you should check this page regularly to look for any changes.\nIf you continue to use our service, then you are telling us that you continue to agree to any changes to these policies.</p>\n<p>YOU SHOULD TAKE PARTICULAR NOTICE THAT THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS: (1) AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE.\n(2) A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST US.\n(3) AND A RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS AGAINST US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE.</p> Arbitration, Controlling Law, and Jurisdiction <p>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.\nIT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>\n<p>If you have any dispute with Chess.com that relates in any way to these Terms of Service or from access to or use of our Service, then both of us agree to pursue a resolution in the following manner:</p> 1.\nInformal Resolution <p>You will first contact us at https://support.chess.com/ to give us Notice of your dispute and attempt to resolve it with us informally.\nYour Notice must include your name, any relevant account name you use, your address, how to contact you, your problem, and what you want us to do.\nWe will attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution of the dispute for at least thirty (30) days from the date you first contact our support group.\nIf we are unable to resolve the dispute informally, then we will pursue a resolution in the following manner:</p> 2.\nArbitration <p>The Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) and federal arbitration law shall apply to these Terms of Service.</p> Arbitration Procedure <p>You must deliver a Notice of Intent to Arbitrate by certified mail using the U.S.\nPostal Service to: Chess.com, Legal, 877 E 1200 S #970397, Orem, UT 84907.\nYour Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of your claim.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief you seek.</p>\n<p>You then will submit any claim to final and binding arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), using its applicable Commercial Arbitration Rules and Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Agreement.\nThe AAA Rules are found at http://www.adr.org.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrator will be bound by this Agreement.\nAAA and the Arbitrator will conduct all phases of the proceeding in English.\nThe Arbitrator will conduct the hearing virtually but, if the parties agree that an in-person hearing is necessary, then the Arbitrator will conduct the hearing either in Utah County, Utah or the county where you reside.\nYou may choose between the two locations.</p>\n<p>Any decision or award will include a written statement which sets forth the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the Arbitrator\u2019s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by you or Chess.com to satisfy one of our individual claims (and which the Arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).\nThe Arbitrator may not award relief against Chess.com respecting any person other than you.</p>\n<p>If necessary, either party may submit any arbitration decision or award to any court of competent jurisdiction to be enforced as a final judgment.</p> Arbitration Fees, Costs, and Attorney\u2019s Fees <p>If you seek a remedy in the amount of $10,000 or less, then Chess.com will promptly reimburse your filing fee and your share, if any, of AAA\u2019s arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation (unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous or were filed for harassment).\nIf you seek a remedy of more than $10,000 \u2013 or if the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules do not apply \u2013 then AAA will split the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, between you and Chess.com, according to the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.</p>\n<p>The Arbitrator shall issue no arbitration award that requires one party to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the other, unless the Arbitrator finds that the party\u2019s claims were frivolous or brought to harass the other.</p>\n<p>Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking relief either in small claims court (for eligible claims) or injunctive or other equitable relief from the civil courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service.</p>\n<p>YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND CHESS.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION CLAIM.</p>\n<p>ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS.</p>\n<p>If for any reason a dispute between you and Chess.com proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, then the laws of the State of Utah and the FAA will govern, without regard to or application of any conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence.\n</p>\n<p>Furthermore, any such dispute will be brought solely in the U.S.\nDistrict Court located in Salt Lake County, Utah or the Utah State District Court in Utah County, Utah, United States.\nYou consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection that it is an inconvenient forum.</p> 3.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution <p>If your dispute pertains to a Chess.com finding that you violated its Fair Play Policy then, if you do not wish to submit it for arbitration with AAA, you may choose to submit it, instead, for final and binding arbitration with a Fair Play Panel of Experts.\nThis panel will conduct its hearing using AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by the Arbitration provisions in Section 2 of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Chess.com will pay all of the fees and costs associated with this Fair Play Panel proceeding (except for your attorney\u2019s fees).\nBoth you and Chess.com will remain responsible for their own attorney\u2019s fees under all circumstances, no matter who prevails in this proceeding.</p>\n<p>The Fair Play Panel will consist of three persons chosen by you and Chess.com from a panel of candidates, each of whom is either a recognized expert in the field of chess cheat detection or has obtained (and currently holds) at least
