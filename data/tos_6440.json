technologies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may Process your Personal Data by placing or reading Cookies and similar technologies.\nFor more information, please see our Cookie Policy below.</p>\n<p>This policy provides detailed information about how and when we use cookies.\nThis cookie policy applies to the Consensus products or services websites that link to this policy or incorporates it by reference.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What is a cookie?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer and tied to information about you.\nBy using and browsing our Sites, you consent to the use by us and third parties of cookies and other technologies in accordance with this Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What are the different types of cookies?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>First party cookies are our own cookies set by our Site, controlled by us, and used to provide information about the usage of our Site.</p>\n<p>Third party cookies are cookies from any other domain.\nSome of our business partners (for example, third-party advertisers) may use cookies on the Site, in emails or in our advertisements on other websites to allow them to deliver the services they are providing.\nIn order to create a user-friendly experience, some of our third-party promotions and advertisements are designed to automatically transmit users\u2019 information onto the third party\u2019s landing page when you choose to \u201cclick\u201d upon a third party\u2019s advertisement or promotion.\nWe do not control these third parties or their use of cookies.\nAs such, this Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertisers.\nPlease check the websites of those third parties for details on how they use cookies.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long do cookies stay on your computer?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Two types of cookies may be used on the Site, session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>\n<p>Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain in your browser or device until you leave the site.\nthey are deleted from your device once you leave the Service.</p>\n<p>Persistent cookies are small files stored on your hard drive until you delete them or until they reach their expiry date.\nThese may, for example, be used to remember your preferences when you use the Site, recognize you on your return, and enhance your experience on the Site (see more about profiles below).\nUse of a persistent cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Site except if you choose to store your user names and PINs so that you do not have to enter them each time you access your accounts.\nThen, a persistent cookie will be stored on your computer, which is linked to your account information.\nIf you reject the persistent cookie, you may still use the Site but you will be limited in some areas of it.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How do we use cookies?</strong>\n<strong>We may use cookies for the following purposes (either on our own or by using third party services): </strong>\n</p>\n<p>Authentication and Preferences: Cookies can be used to recognize you when you visit our Sites, remember your preferences (such as languages and communication preferences), and customize your experience with using our Sites and Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Security: Cookies may enable and support our security features and to help us detect malicious activity.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Advertising: Cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off our Sites.\nWe may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who saw an ad later visited and took an action on the advertiser\u2019s site.\nSimilarly, our partners may use a cookie to determine whether we\u2019ve shown an ad and how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.\nWe may also work with a partner to show you an ad on or off our <br>Sites, such as after you have visited a partner\u2019s site or application.</p>\n<p>Analytics: We use cookies to understand, improve, and research products, features, and services, including when you access our Sites from other websites, applications, or devices such as your mobile device.</p>\n<p>Geo-Location Information: Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS).\nSome photos or other contact you place within our Service may contain recorded location information.\nWe may use this information to optimize your experience.\nAlso, some of the information we collect from a device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a device\u2019s location.</p>\n<p>Flash Cookies: We may, in certain situations, use Adobe Flash Player to deliver special content, such as video clips or animation.\nFlash cookies are stored on your device, but they are managed through an interface that is different from the one provided by your web browser.\nThis means that it is not possible to manage Flash cookies at the browser level in the same way you would manage other types of cookies.\nInstead, you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe\u2019s website directly.</p>\n<p>Our List of Cookies may provide you with more information on the cookies used on our Sites.\nNote, the names of cookies, pixels and other technologies may change over time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What other technologies do we use?</strong>\n<strong>Log Files</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Like most websites, our servers use log files to analyze trends, administer our sites, track user\u2019s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.\nThe log file information consists of IP addresses, browser type, browser language, referring URL, platform type, etc., and is not linked to identifiable personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Clear Gifs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and we may use them to track the online movements of our users.\nClear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller than cookies, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.\nWe may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.\nThis allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Profile</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We may store information that we collect to create a profile of our users.\nA profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences.\nConsequently, collected information may be tied to users\u2019 personally identifiable information to improve the content of the Site for users, improve our Services and provide new services that are likely to be of interest to users and to direct pertinent product updates and marketing promotions to users if they have opted in to receive those promotions.\nWe do not share personally identifiable elements of a user\u2019s profile with other third parties.\nUser profiles are shared in aggregate form only.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track Response</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a \u201cdo not track\u201d option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked.\nThis is different from blocking cookies as browsers with the \u201cdo not track\u201d option selected may still accept cookies.\nRight now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, although one may be adopted in the future.\nWe do not respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals at this time.\nIf we do so in the future, we will modify this Privacy Policy accordingly.\nMore information about \u201cdo not track\u201d is available at www.allaboutdnt.org.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Can I Change My Cookie Preferences?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Browser settings allow you to choose whether or not to accept cookies or limit certain cookies.\nMost browsers also provide functionality that lets you review and erase cookies.\nIf you use our Sites without changing your browser settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on our Sites.\nPlease be aware that if cookies are disabled, not all features of the Site may operate as intended.</p>\n<p>Your mobile operating system may let you opt out from having your information collected or used for interest-based advertising on mobile devices.\nYou should refer to the instructions provided by your mobile device\u2019s manufacturer, but this functionality is usually available in the \u201cSettings\u201d section of your device.\nYou can also stop us from collecting information through our applications by uninstalling our applications.</p>\n<p>For more information about these specialized cookies and other technologies, and to

in addition to any other liabilities you may incur as a result of such non-compliance.</p>\n<p>In order to improve the customer experience for our end users, the Company or its third party service

System and/or to improve customer experience as referenced above.</p>\n<p>Unless you are obtaining a license to the System through a Company Partner (as described below), your use of the System is based upon the prepaid subscription you have chosen.\nYou will be billed at your chosen period in advance, using the payment method you choose.\nIf for some reason you do not renew or we are unable to

purpose.</p>\n<p>End users must have in place and maintain all appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of Private Information (as defined below) and against the destruction, loss, or alteration of the data transmitted through the System that are no less rigorous than those maintained by End User for its own information of a similar nature, but no less than reasonable safeguards.\nThese safeguards should also protect the Private Information from any intentional or unintentional use or disclosure that is in violation of any applicable laws, and limit incidental uses or disclosures made pursuant to otherwise permitted or required disclosures.\n\u201cPrivate Information\u201d means: (i) PHI, (ii) Nonpublic Personal Financial Information and, as applicable, Nonpublic Personal Health Information, as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act.\nor (iii) any data or information that: (1) relates to an individual, and (2) identifies or can

Company and its applicable licensors and providers as necessary to resolve the Breach.\n\u201cBreach\u201d has the same meaning as defined in 45 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 164.402 and, therefore, is limited to a

limited to, the security and configuration of the connection and remote system, the use of data obtained from the Outside Service, and accuracy of data</p>\n<p>transmitted to or from the Outside Service.\nYou further agree that you will not use the System to connect to an Outside Service in a way that may violate the policies or rights of any organization or individual or cause harm to the

only in accordance with the purposes contemplated by this TOS.\nYou further agree to allow the Company and/or its third-party licensors/providers to access, inspect, and audit records related to the use of the System and the data and networks of such third-party licensors/providers.</p>\n<p>The System may contain third-party software that requires notices and/or additional terms and conditions which are incorporated by reference into this TOS and you are accepting the additional terms and conditions of these third parties.\nSuch third-party software notices and/or additional terms and conditions will be provided by the Company upon request.</p>\n<p>The Company collects and analyzes data relating to the use and performance of the System and all of the supporting systems (\u201cSystem Data\u201d) and uses System Data during and after the term of your subscription.\nSystem Data is used to improve and enhance the systems and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in connection with the systems.\nThe Company may also disclose System Data in aggregate and anonymized format.\nSystem Data will never include PHI.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limited Warranty</strong>\n<br>If you are obtaining access to the System directly from the Company (and not a Company Partner), then the Company warrants that, when used with a recommended hardware configuration, the System will perform in substantial conformance with the documentation supplied with the System.\nYour exclusive remedy under the preceding limited warranty is to report the noncompliance to the Company, upon which the Company will use reasonable commercial efforts to correct the non- conformance so that the System substantially conforms to the foregoing warranty, or, if Company is not able to correct the non- conformance within thirty (30) days after receipt of your report, terminate your subscription and refund to you a pro rata portion of your subscription fee for the unearned portion of your subscription to the System.\nAny misuse, accident, abuse, modification or misapplication of the System will void the warranty above.\nTHIS REMEDY IS THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR BREACH OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SYSTEM.\nIF YOU ARE OBTAINING ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM FROM OR THROUGH A COMPANY PARTNER, YOU MUST REPORT AND PROVIDE ANY WARRANTY CLAIMS DIRECTLY TO SUCH COMPANY PARTNER, AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO MAKE ANY WARRANTY CLAIM DIRECTLY AGAINST THE COMPANY.\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN, THE SYSTEM IS

NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nIN ADDITION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INTEROPERABILITY OF THE SYSTEM WITH THIRD-PARTY SYSTEM OR DEVICES MAY BE DEPENDENT ON THE ACTIONS OF THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, AND FOR WHICH THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO LIABILITY.\nWe will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the System.\nSome states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>\n<br>TO

SUCH COMPANY PARTNER FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONIN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE.\nSome states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Term and Termination</strong>\n<br>You may terminate your contract to use the System at any time in accordance with the terms of your subscription.\nIn the event that you fail
