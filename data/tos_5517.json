Your personal data will not be stored or processed for sinister purposes please rest assured!</p>\nWhat personal information do we collect from the people that visit our website?\n<p>Like most website operators, Collabora collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nCollabora\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Collabora\u2019s visitors use its website.\nFrom time to time, Collabora may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>\n<p>Collabora Productivity also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on collaboraoffice.com blogs.\nCollabora only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>\nGathering of Personally-Identifying Information\n<p>Certain visitors to Collabora\u2019s websites choose to interact with Collabora in ways that require Collabora to gather personally-identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that Collabora gathers depend on the nature of the interaction.\nFor example, we ask visitors who request a demo at collaboraoffice.com to provide data like a name and email address.\nCollabora does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\nAnd visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>\nHow do we use your information?\n<p>Collabora may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.\nFor instance, Collabora may monitor

information other than as described below.<br>\nCollabora may profile individuals based on their use of our website to provide a better service or more relevant contact or interaction for that visitor.<br>\nIf you are a registered user of a Collabora website or have supplied your email address, Collabora may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features and services, to solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with Collabora and our products.\nWe primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.\nSuch E-mails may contain links that when clicked may authenticate to or otherwise identify you with our services.\nWe will keep your data on file for up to three years before requesting further permission to store it.\nIf you want more details or your information please contact us.</p>\nHow do we protect Certain Personally-Identifying Information?\n<p>Collabora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, affiliates, and partners

anyone.\nOther than to its employees, contractors, affiliates, and partners, as described above, Collabora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a witness summons, court order, or other governmental request, or when Collabora believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of

help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nCollabora takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
