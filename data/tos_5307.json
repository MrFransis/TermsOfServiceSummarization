customer in the United States\n(including its possessions and territories), you and Shutterfly agree that any\ndispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the\nShutterfly service, these Terms of Use and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be\ndetermined by binding arbitration or in small claims court.\nArbitration is more\ninformal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead\nof a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is\nsubject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same\ndamages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to these\nTerms of Use, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and\nenforcement of this provision, and that&nbsp;<strong>you and Shutterfly are each\nwaiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action</strong>.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the\ntermination of your Shutterfly account.</p>\n<p>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to Shutterfly, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice to Shutterfly must be addressed to: General Counsel, Shutterfly, LLC, 2800 Bridge Parkway, Redwood City, CA 94065 (\u201cNotice Address\u201d).\nIf Shutterfly initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to the email address used for your account.\nA Notice, whether sent by you or by Shutterfly, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\n(b) set forth the specific relief sought and the basis for the calculations.\n</p>\n<p>(c) include your name, the email address associated with your Shutterfly account, your current phone number, mailing address, and email address, and your signature.\nand (d) if you have retained an attorney, your signed statement authorizing Shutterfly to disclose your confidential account records to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim.\nIf Shutterfly and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you or Shutterfly may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court.</p>\n<p>You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at&nbsp;www.adr.org.\nIf you are required to pay a filing fee, after Shutterfly receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, if you previously had fully complied with the Notice requirement in the preceding paragraph, Shutterfly will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$1,000, in which event you will be responsible for filing fees.</p>\n<p>The arbitration will be\ngoverned by the Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, \u201cAAA Rules\u201d) of the\nAmerican Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d), as modified by this Agreement, and\nwill be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and Forms are available online\nat&nbsp;www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at\n1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address.\nThe arbitrator is bound by\nthe terms of this Agreement.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide,\nincluding issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration\nagreement.\nUnless Shutterfly and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings\nwill take place in the county of your residence.</p>\n<p>If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nThe arbitrator may consider rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers, but an arbitrator\u2019s ruling will not be binding in proceedings involving different customers.\nIf you had fully complied with the Notice requirement above and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Shutterfly\u2019s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Shutterfly did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Shutterfly will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater.\nExcept as expressly set forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>YOU AND SHUTTERFLY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nFurther, unless both you and Shutterfly agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim.&nbsp.\nIf any provision of this paragraph is determined to be unenforceable with respect to any claim or any particular remedy for a claim (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then the parties agree that the claim or particular remedy (and only that claim or remedy) must be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>19.\nSHUTTERFLY PRIVACY POLICY</strong> View our Privacy Policy by

about you or others, and this section of our Privacy Center addresses frequently asked questions about Your Content.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do you share the photos that I upload to Shutterfly? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>At Shutterfly, we value the trust you place in us when you store Your Content on our platform, and we can assure you that we treat Your Content as private information that belongs to you.&nbsp.\nWe share your photos only in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>If you ask us to.</em>\n</strong> Enabling you to share your photos electronically is one of the key benefits we offer at Shutterfly.\nYou are able to send an email invitation to your selected recipients, and then allow them to view, save, or purchase products from your pictures.\nThis email invitation contains a link created specifically for your pictures.\nSimilarly, if you choose to share your photo albums through Shutterfly Share Sites, you may invite recipients to participate in that site and those people will also have access to the photos on that Share Site.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Order fulfillment.</em>\n</strong> In order to provide our service, the Shutterfly employees and agents who work to fulfill your order and service your account may see your Content in the course of performing their jobs.&nbsp.\nSimilarly, if you order a product that includes Your Content, we may share Your Content with third party partners who help us fulfill your order.\nThese parties are only allowed to use your photos to perform services for Shutterfly, though \u2013 they can\u2019t use them for any other purpose.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>Can\nI upload videos from YouTube to my Share Site? What information does Shutterfly\nshare with YouTube?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you use Shutterfly\u2019s Share Sites, you have the option to upload videos from YouTube to your Share Site.\nWe do not share your personal data with YouTube.\nInstead, we share only your search terms you use to find the video to download through YouTube\u2019s API Services.\nBut, if you are curious, YouTube is owned by Google, and you can view Google\u2019s privacy policy here&nbsp;.&nbsp.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Shutterfly use my photos in advertisements?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>No, Shutterfly does not use your photos in our advertisements.\nPhotos you upload to Shutterfly may be incorporated into product recommendations that appear on your Shutterfly homepage or in communications we send to you, but these photos aren\u2019t used in public advertising, and only you will receive customized product recommendations made using your photos.\nYou may opt out of receiving such communications from us and change your contact preferences within your account at any time.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Shutterfly collect information from my photos and projects? If so, how do you use it?&nbsp.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>What we collect.</em>\n</strong> When you upload your photos to our platform or give us permission to access the photos stored on your device, your photo content may also include related image information such as the time and the place your photo was taken and similar \u201cmetadata\u201d captured by your image capture device.\nIf you wish to restrict the capture of image metadata in your individual photos, please adjust the settings on your image capture device.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>How we use it</em>\n</strong>\n<em>.</em> We may analyze your photo content and metadata to help you tag and organize your photos and to make personalized product suggestions to you based on those photos, such as showing you how your pictures may look in a collage or other Shutterfly product.&nbsp.\nWe may send you reminders and suggestions based on the information you include in your projects, such as birthdays and anniversaries.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n<em>Face grouping.\n</em>\n</strong>As you add new photos, we automatically associate similar faces (if you have the face grouping feature enabled), places and other image characteristics within your photo collection.\nIf you have the face grouping feature enabled, when you upload photos of yourself, friends, family or others, we create a numerical representation of the faces detected in your photos and automatically group similar faces together.\nWe only use this feature to help you organize, tag and create personalized products from your own photos.\nWe never attempt to determine whether any similar faces appear in photos uploaded by different Shutterfly users or otherwise identify the people in your photos.\nWe do not sell or share this information with third parties.\nAnd we won\u2019t suggest any tags for your own photos except the ones that you choose to create for your own face groups.\nYou may disable this feature through your account settings at any time.\nIf you do so, we will delete any facial grouping data associated with your photos from our servers and will not collect such information going forward.\nif you use the Shutterfly App on a mobile device, face grouping data is stored on your device, and will be deleted the next time you sign into the App.\nIf your account information indicates that you are a resident of Illinois, we will delete face grouping data when it has been more than three years since your last interaction with Shutterfly.\nIf you have face grouping enabled, you are representing to us that you have obtained consent for the feature from the people who appear in your photos or, if they are under the age of 18, from their parent or legal guardian.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How

professional photographs taken in portrait studios, schools, businesses and other organizations that Lifetouch serves.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Lifetouch use pictures of customers in advertisements?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Not without permission of the photo subject.\nLifetouch is proud of its work as a professional photographer, and from time to time we request permission from our customers to display their photos as samples of our work.&nbsp.\nLifetouch does <u>not</u> use its customers\u2019 photographs in marketing or advertising materials to third parties without first obtaining a photo release from the photo subject (or, in the case of a minor, the photo subject\u2019s parent or legal representative).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Lifetouch share my child\u2019s school photos with my child\u2019s school?&nbsp.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Yes \u2013 schools and preschools across the United States and Canada entrust Lifetouch to photograph students and staff as part of the time-honored tradition of Picture Day.&nbsp.\nLifetouch provides those photos to the school for use in the school yearbook, student IDs, classroom seating charts and other school-related purposes.&nbsp.\nLifetouch also offers the photographs for purchase by parents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How long does Lifetouch keep photos?&nbsp.\nWhat are my options?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When Lifetouch is engaged by a school or other organization as its official photographer, the photos we capture for that organization are deleted in the ordinary course of business within a reasonable time after we have fulfilled our contractual obligations, with the exception of photos associated with customers who elect to purchase from us (Lifetouch Customers).&nbsp.\nIf you are a Lifetouch Customer, our goal is to make the photos we create available to you for years to come, and we will endeavor to retain a digital copy of one or more of your current and future source photos for you to claim and archive in your Shutterfly account indefinitely, if you choose to do so.\nFor example, if you purchase your child\u2019s first grade school photo, and Lifetouch photographs your child the following year, we may associate that photo with you and make the digital image available to you to purchase and store in your Shutterfly account.</p>\n<p>If you wish, you can take steps to have your photos deleted from our systems earlier, by contacting us at (800) 736-4753.\n&nbsp;We may require certain information from you to validate your request before deletion.&nbsp.\nPlease be aware, however, that Lifetouch may deny your request and retain your photos under certain limited circumstances \u2013 for example, if we have a contractual commitment to a school or other organization you are affiliated with (such as providing yearbook photos or the yearbook itself), if doing so would violate a law or court order, or if it would be unreasonably burdensome.&nbsp.\nAlso, please be aware that, if you shared your photo with other purchasers, your photo deletion request will not affect any photos retained in others\u2019 photo libraries or those purchasers\u2019 archiving preferences.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do I need a Shutterfly account to purchase school photos? </strong>\n</p>\n<p>No.&nbsp.\nYou may purchase traditional printed school photos from Lifetouch for delivery to you through your child\u2019s school.&nbsp.\nHowever, if you purchase a digital image or are eligible to receive a digital image through a promotion or loyalty program, you will need a Shutterfly account to claim such digital images.&nbsp.\nAs a part of the Shutterfly family of brands, Lifetouch delivers all digital images to customers via the Shutterfly.com secure photo

Lifetouch receive from schools?&nbsp.\n</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The information we need for Picture Day depends upon the specific services and deliverables Lifetouch is providing your school.\nWe limit the information we collect to only that which is necessary for Picture Day and related authorized school purposes.&nbsp.\nWe collect the basic information in advance of Picture Day to match names to the pictures we take and for efficient distribution within the school.&nbsp.\nWe may receive your email or mailing address in order to deliver Picture Day-related communications on behalf of the school.&nbsp.\nIn such cases, we do not retain or use your contact information for any other purpose unless you opt in to receive updates and promotional offers from us.</p>\n<p>In addition, the information may be incorporated into other items that we are providing to your school.&nbsp.\nFor example, if Lifetouch is producing student ID cards, we need the student ID number to do the job.\nOur yearbook image product includes images of students sorted by name, grade and other classifying data per your school\u2019s requirements.&nbsp.\nSchools ultimately decide how much, or how little, information is used in producing School Service Items.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nLifetouch never has access to sensitive information, such as grades or attendance data, from your child\u2019s record.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>How does Lifetouch use the information it receives from schools?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As part of our agreement with your child\u2019s school, Lifetouch provides

student recognition, awards, teacher tools, yearbooks, memory books and class composites.&nbsp.\nThese services are provided throughout the school year.&nbsp.\nLifetouch uses the basic information that it collects solely as necessary to produce such items for the school, to deliver Picture Day-related notices on behalf of your school, and to provide you opportunities to purchase your child\u2019s school pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>**Lifetouch does not sell, trade or share student data collected from your child\u2019s school with third parties for their marketing purposes,

</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Lifetouch retains the basic information it collects from schools only as necessary and permissible to promote the sale of school pictures to parents, to retrieve the images to supply picture orders and to support the school for an approved administrative purpose.&nbsp.\nOnce such data is no longer needed for such purposes, it is securely destroyed.&nbsp.\nWhile retained, it remains under Lifetouch\u2019s control and treated as confidential information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>What are my options as a parent?</em>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In its role as official school photographer, Lifetouch photographs all students who appear at the camera on Picture Day, and we rely on your child\u2019s school or district to obtain any parental consents necessary for us to do the work they engaged us for.&nbsp.\nOur photographers reasonably presume that they are permitted to photograph each individual who appears at the camera for that purpose.&nbsp.\nIf you are a parent who does not want your child to participate in your school\u2019s Picture Day, you must pre-arrange with the school not to have your child photographed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lifetouch acknowledges its obligations as a service provider to your school for student and staff photography pursuant to the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d).&nbsp.\nYour school retains the authority to control Lifetouch\u2019s use of the information it provides to Lifetouch and to require its return or destruction at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp.\nWe will honor a parent\u2019s image deletion request, subject to verification and authorization of the school when deletion would impact our ability to deliver an item or service requested by the school.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you choose to purchase your child\u2019s school photos from Lifetouch, the personal information you provide to us will be treated as customer information and used as described in our Privacy Notice.\n&nbsp;Unless purchased by a parent (or by someone with whom the parent has shared the photo), however, we retain school photos only as long as necessary to satisfy our obligations to the schools we
