deploying contextual, interest-based and other types of advertising, as well as targeting, ad measurement and attribution systems.\nThe ads and content we or our advertising partners deliver may be shown within our Services or through other channels, such as third-party websites and applications.</p>\n<p>Such data includes your IP address, cookies, pixels and other unique identifiers, data related to your connected Social Network Account, and other demographic and interests-based information that we or our advertising partners may have received from or about you, based on your consent or another legal basis (i.e., as required in order to provide you with our respective services, or based on the legitimate interests that we described in Section 2 above).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When you use

that we may store in our first-party cookie for our use in online and cross-channel advertising, and it may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising.<br>\nThe information shared for such activities may include&nbsp;your email (in hashed and non-identifying form),&nbsp;IP address&nbsp;and&nbsp;information about your browser or operating system.<br>\nTo opt out of this use, please&nbsp;click here.</p>\n<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the processing of your data by our advertising partners and networks.\nWe recommend that you review their privacy policies for more information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A list of the cookies and other tracking technologies we use, as well as additional information concerning our advertising partners and networks (and their policies), can be found here: https://www.openweb.com/cookies/&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Our practices with respect to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals:&nbsp;</b>DNT signals are the result of a standardization initiative from 2009 to create a standard signal which could be broadcasted by any web browser, and read by websites accessed through such browser, to note an individual\u2019s preference not to be tracked online.</p>\n<p>While the working group assigned to this standardization initiative by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was disbanded in 2019, the&nbsp;California Online Privacy Protection Act&nbsp;(CalOPPA) still requires website publishers/operators to disclose whether they respond to web browsers\u2019 \u2018do not track\u2019 (DNT) signals.</p>\n<p>Similar to most websites, the&nbsp;OpenWeb.com&nbsp;website does not change its practices in response to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal in the HTTP header from a browser, as unfortunately these are, from a technical perspective, not sufficiently reliable or standardized for us to warrant full adherence.</p>\n<p>We do recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, but if you choose to remove or block them we definitely respect your choice.\nModern web browsers typically allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them.\nYou may also set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies entirely through your browser settings.</p>\n<p>OpenWeb supports initiatives of greater transparency and control for users, and offers the following options for controlling the interest-based content and ads you receive: If you reside in the EU and do not want to receive interest-based ads displayed by OpenWeb, you can disable the display of such ads by visiting the EDAA consumer choice page at www.youronlinechoices.eu.\nYou may also use the NAI opt out tool, which will allow you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from other NAI-approved member companies, and for mobile opt outs, the NAI provides instructions to engage system-level opt outs in Android, iOS, and Windows Phone environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you reside in California and wish to opt-out of the \u201csale\u201d of your personal information, as defined under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), please follow the instructions in Section \u200e8 below.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please note that opting out will not prevent you from seeing ads sourced from us on our Services or on other websites, but it will affect the types of ads that you will see.\nThese ads will no longer be tailored to your interests and instead will be chosen based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e.\ncontextually based ads).\nBecause our tracking mechanisms operate at the device and browser level, to fully opt-out across devices, you will need to do so on each device and browser individually.\nAlso, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the EDAA consumer choice page, your-opt out may not be effective.</p>\n<p>6.\nCommunications</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Service Communications</strong>: We may contact you with important information regarding our Services.\nFor example, we may notify you (through any of the means available to us, e.g.\nphone, mobile, web notifications or e-mail) of changes or updates to our Services, billing issues, service changes, password-retrieval notices, etc.\nTypically, you will not be able to opt-out of receiving such service communications while using our Services, as they are integral to such use.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notifications and Promotional Communications</strong>: We may send you notifications, messages and other updates about new features, offerings, events and special opportunities or any other information we think our Users or Partners will find valuable.\nWe may provide such notices through any of the contact means available to us, through the Services, or through our marketing campaigns on any other sites or platforms.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to receive such promotional communications, you may notify OpenWeb at any time by changing your communications preferences in your account, by following the \u201cunsubscribe\u201d, \u201cstop\u201d, \u201copt-out\u201d or \u201cchange e-mail preferences\u201d instructions contained in the promotional communications you receive, or by sending an email to&nbsp;privacy@openweb.com.</p>\n<p>7.\nData Security</p>\n<p>In order to protect your Personal Data held with us and our Service Providers, we are using industry-standard physical, procedural and electronic security measures, including encryption as appropriate.\nHowever, please be aware that regardless of any security measures used, we cannot and do not guarantee the absolute protection and security of any Personal Data stored with us or with any third parties as described in Section 4 above.</p>\n<p>8.\nData Subject Rights</p>\n<p>If you wish to exercise your rights under any applicable law, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), such as the right to request access to, and rectification or erasure of your Personal Data held with OpenWeb, or to restrict or object to such Personal Data\u2019s processing, or to port such Personal Data, or to opt-out of the sale of your personal information, or the right to equal services and prices (each to the extent available to you under the laws which apply to you) \u2013 please follow the instructions available on our dedicated CCPA or GDPR pages, or contact us by email at privacy@openweb.com.</p>\n<p>Please note that once you contact us by e-mail, we may require additional information and documents, including certain Personal Data, in order to authenticate and validate your identity and to process your request.\nSuch additional data will be then retained by us for legal purposes (e.g.\nas proof of the identity of the person submitting the request), in accordance with Section 3 above.</p>\n<p>OpenWeb adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles set forth by the&nbsp;European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance&nbsp;(EDAA), and to the&nbsp;Interactive Advertising Bureau\u2019s&nbsp;(IAB) Europe&nbsp;Online Behavioral Advertising Framework.</p>\n<p>To update your AdChoices Opt Out settings, select your region&nbsp;here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>9.\nChildren\u2019s Privacy</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Our Services are not designed to attract children under the age of 16</strong>.\nWe do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children and do not wish to do so.\nIf we learn that a person under the age of 16 is using the Services, we will prohibit and block such use and will make all efforts to promptly delete any Personal Data stored with us with regard to such child.\nIf you believe that we might have any such data, please contact us by email at&nbsp;privacy@openweb.com.</p>\n<p>10.\nData Controller/Processor</p>\n<p>Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the EU GDPR or the CCPA, typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing Personal Data: the \u201cData Controller\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cbusiness\u201d), who determines the purposes and means of processing.\nand the \u201cData Processor\u201d (or under the CCPA, \u201cservice provider\u201d), who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.\nBelow we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.</p>\n<p>OpenWeb is typically the \u201cData Controller\u201d of its Visitors\u2019, its Users\u2019 and its Partners\u2019 Personal Data, and with respect to which, assumes the responsibilities of Data Controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy.\nUnder the CCPA, we are either the \u201cbusiness\u201d with respect to Users\u2019 Personal Data (if the User are directly engaged with us), or a \u201cthird party\u201d (if such Users do not directly engage with us, whilst we process their personal information on our own behalf).</p>\n<p>In the relationship between a publishing Partner and OpenWeb, such Partner shall act as \u201cData Controller\u201d (or \u201cbusiness\u201d under the CCPA) with respect to its own end-users and Users of their Partner Site(s).\nIn certain instances, OpenWeb will only be deemed as the Data Processor (or service provider) regarding such end-users\u2019 Personal Data, if we process such end-users\u2019 data on behalf of our Partner and in accordance with its reasonable instructions, subject to our Terms of Use and other commercial agreements.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>If you would like to make any requests or queries regarding Personal Data we process on our Partner\u2019s behalf, please contact such Partner directly.</strong>&nbsp;For example, if you are an end-user of our Partner who wishes to access, correct, or delete data processed by OpenWeb on behalf of such Partner, please direct your request to the relevant Partner.</p>\n<p>11.\nAdditional Notices</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Updates and Amendments</b>: We may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Services.\nThe amended version will be effective as of the date it is so published.\nWe will provide a 10-day prior notice if we believe any substantial changes are involved via any of the communication means available to us or via the Services.\nAfter such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.</p>\n<p>\n<b>External Links</b>: While our Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices,

information from your registration Cookies with analytics Cookies, which we can use to identify which pages you have seen.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Marketing &amp.\nAdvertising Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;These Cookies allow us to know whether or not you\u2019ve seen an ad or a type of ad, how you interacted with such an ad, and how long it has been since you\u2019ve seen it.</p>\n<p>We also use Cookies to help us with targeted advertising.\nWe may use Cookies set by another organization, so we can more accurately target advertisements to you.</p>\n<p>We also set Cookies on certain other sites that we advertise on.\nIf you receive one of those Cookies, we may use it to identify you as having visited that site if you later visit our Services.\nWe can then target our advertisements based on this information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third Party Integration Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;On some pages of our Services, other organizations may also set their own Cookies.\nThey do this to track the performance of their applications that are integrated with our Services or to customize their services for you.\nBecause of how Cookies work, our website cannot access these Cookies, nor can the other organization access the data in Cookies we use on our Services.</p> Which Cookies do we use? <p>We store Tracking Technologies when you visit or access our Services (for example when you are visiting our websites) \u2013 these are called \u201cFirst Party Tracking Technologies\u201d.\nIn addition, Tracking Technologies are stored by other third parties (for example our analytics service providers, business partners and advertisers) who run content on our Services \u2013 these are called \u201cThird Party Tracking Technologies\u201d.</p>\n<p>Both types of Tracking Technologies may be stored either for the duration of your visit on our Services or for repeat visits.</p> What types of Tracking Technologies do we use? <p>There are five main types of Tracking Technologies:</p>\n<strong>1.Strictly necessary Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>These Tracking Technologies are essential to enable you to login, navigate around and use the features of our Services, or to provide a service requested by you (such as your username).\nWe do not need to obtain your consent in order to use these Tracking Technologies.\nThese Tracking Technologies can be used for security and integrity reasons \u2013 for example to detect violation of our policies and for support or security features.</p>\n<strong>2.\nFunctionality Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>These Tracking Technologies allow our Services to remember choices you make (such as your language) and provide enhanced and personalized features.\nFor example, these Tracking Technologies are used for authentication (to remember when you are logged-in) and support other features of our Services.</p>\n<strong>3.\nPerformance Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>These Tracking Technologies collect information about your online activity (for example the duration of your visit on our Services), including behavioral data and content engagement metrics.\nThese Tracking Technologies are used for analytics, research and to perform statistics (based on aggregated information).</p>\n<strong>4.\nMarketing or Advertising Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>These Tracking Technologies are used to deliver tailored offers and advertisements to you, based on your derived interests, as well as to perform email marketing campaigns.\nThey can also be used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.\nThey are usually placed by our advertisers (for example advertising networks) and provide them insights about the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites or use their app.</p>\n<strong>5.\nSocial Media Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>Our website includes social media features, such as the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cShare\u201d buttons.\nThese features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services.\nYour interactions with these features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing these features.</p>\n<p>6.\n<strong>Our practices with respect to Do-Not-Track (DNT) signals</strong>\n</p>\n<p>DNT signals are the result of a standardization initiative from 2009 to create a standard signal which could be broadcasted by any web browser, and read by any website publisher/operator, to note an individual\u2019s preference not to be tracked online.<br>\n</p>\n<p>While the working group assigned to this standardization initiative by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was disbanded in 2019, the&nbsp;California Online Privacy Protection Act&nbsp;(CalOPPA) still requires website publishers/operators to disclose whether they respond to web browsers\u2019 \u2018do not track\u2019 (DNT) signals.<br>\n</p>\n<p>OpenWeb does not change its practices in response to a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d signal in the HTTP header from a browser, as unfortunately these are, from a technical perspective, not sufficiently reliable or standardized for us to warrant full adherence.</p>\n<p>We do recommend the use of cookies for an optimal user experience of our Services, but if you choose to remove or block them we definitely respect your choice.\nModern web browsers typically allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and to remove them.\nYou may also set most browsers to notify you if you
