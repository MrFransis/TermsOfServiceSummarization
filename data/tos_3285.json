these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the \u201clast modified date\u201d.\nYou agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so.\nYou agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms.\nIf the \u201clast modified\u201d date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged.\nOn the other hand, if the
