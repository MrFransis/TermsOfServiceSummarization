Aura values and promotes as a\ncompany.\nAs such, we think it\u2019s important to be transparent about how we handle\nyour information.\nThat level of transparency also makes for a lengthy document,\nbut we\u2019ve tried to make it more readable by organizing it into a logical\nstructure and by using plain language.</p>\n<p>Aura offers a variety of services, and certain services may process data\ndifferently, or in additional ways, to other services and what\u2019s described in\nthis policy.\nWe note these differences in Product Privacy Notices&nbsp.\nthat are specific to such services, in product documentation, or inside products themselves at places where such information is relevant.\nPlease refer to these Products\nPrivacy Notices to better understand our privacy practices for each of the\nproducts.</p>\n<p>This policy uses the term \u201cpersonal data\u201d to refer to information that is related to\nan identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data\nunder applicable data protection law.</p>\n<strong>Who is Aura?</strong>\n<p>In this policy, \u201cAura\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d refer to

Customers</strong>\n<p>Some of Aura\u2019s services are offered to businesses.\nFor those services, our customer\nis a business or other organization who may authorize individual end users to\nuse the services that it has purchased from us.\nWhere an organization is our\ncustomer, it may maintain accounts with Aura through which it and its users may\nsubmit information (\u201c<strong>Customer Data</strong>\u201d).\nThat organization typically controls those accounts and any associated Customer Data.\nIn this case, Aura is generally a processor of Customer Data and the organization is the controller.</p>\n<strong>1.\nWhat information do we collect about you?</strong>\n<p>This section describes the various types of information we collect from and about\nyou.\nThis information is not

your device\u2019s GPS or other\ndevice sensor data.\nHowever, we may collect your approximate location by\ncalculating an imprecise latitude and longitude based on your IP address to\nprovide you

management\nand invite individuals to use those products.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You generally do not have a duty to disclose personal data to us unless\nyou have a contractual obligation to us to do so.\nHowever, we need to collect\nand process certain information that is necessary or legally required in order\nto provide the services to you or otherwise perform our contractual\nrelationships with you.</p>\n<strong>2.\nHow do we use your information?</strong>\n<p>We use the information we collect for various purposes described below.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide, maintain, troubleshoot, and support our services.</strong> We use your information for this purpose on the basis that it is required to fulfill our contractual obligations to you.\nExamples: using information

by responding to your requests, and sending you information and updates about our services.\nWe may do\nthis in order to fulfill our contract with you, because you consented to the\ncommunication, or because we have a legitimate interest in providing you with\ninformation about our services.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To improve our services.\n</strong>We want to offer you the best services and\nuser experiences we can, so we have a legitimate interest in continually\nimproving and optimizing our services.\nTo do so, we use your information to\nunderstand how users interact with our services.\nExamples: we analyze certain\nusage, device, and diagnostic information to understand aggregated usage trends\nand user engagement with our services (and, for example, invest in technical\ninfrastructure to better serve regions with increasing user demand).\nwe may use\ndevice and threat information to conduct spam, threat, and other scientific\nresearch to improve our threat detection capabilities.\nwe review customer\nfeedback to understand what we could be doing better.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To develop new services.</strong> We have a legitimate interest in using\nyour information to plan for and develop new services.\nFor example, we may use\ncustomer feedback to understand what new services users may want.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To market and advertise our services.\n</strong>We may use your information to provide,\nmeasure, personalize, and enhance our advertising and marketing based on our\nlegitimate interest in offering you services that may be of interest.\nExamples:\nwe may use information such as who or what referred you to our services to\nunderstand how effective our advertising is.\nwe may use information to\nadminister promotional activities such as sweepstakes and referral programs.\nNote that our VPN products do not use your VPN browsing activity for these\npurposes and we do not maintain any records that show

investigate security issues or to monitor and prevent\nfraud) and to prevent abuse.\nWe may do this to comply with our legal\nobligations, to protect an individual\u2019s vital interests, or because we have a\nlegitimate interest in preventing harm or liability to Aura and our users.\nFor\nexample, we may use account, usage, and device information to determine if an\nentity is engaging in abusive or unauthorized activity in connection with our\nservices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For legal compliance.\n</strong>We internally use your information as\nrequired by applicable law, legal

General</strong>\n<p>\nWe may disclose your information in the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>In accordance with your instructions or consent.</strong>\nFor example, some services may allow you to register an account using a third\nparty account (such as a Google or Microsoft account).\nIf you choose to do so,\nwe will share information with the third party account provider.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To your business organization (for our\nbusiness services).</strong> If a business customer is providing you with access to our services\nthrough a business account, others in that organization may be able to see and\nmanage your account and the information associated with it (such as an\nadministrator).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For collaborating with others.\n</strong>Some services may provide ways for\ndifferent users to interact or collaborate with each other.\nYour information\nwill be shared in connection with those activities if you choose to engage in\nthem.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Affiliates and third party service providers.\n</strong>To\nhelp us provide some aspects of our services, we work with trusted third\nparties and partners (including affiliated companies in the Aura group).\nTo\nprotect your data, we enter into appropriate confidentiality and data\nprocessing terms with these third parties, review their security practices, and\nlimit information sharing to the scope of what they are helping us with.\nExamples of activities that third parties help us with include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>processing customer payments</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>providing analytics about our services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>providing sales and customer support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>maintaining the infrastructure required to provide our services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>delivering our marketing and advertising content</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For security research purposes.</strong> A sanitized subset of our threat\nintelligence data may be shared with selected reputable members of the\ncybersecurity industry for the purpose of security threat research and\nfacilitating community efforts to improve online security.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To a new owner.</strong> If ownership or control of all or part of\nour services, assets, or business changes, we may transfer your information to\nthe new owner.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated or de-identified data.</strong> We may use and share aggregated data and\ndata that is de-identified such that it no longer reveals the identity of an\nindividual user for regulatory compliance, research and analysis, our own\nmarketing and advertising activities and other legitimate business purposes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To comply with legal process and the law.</strong> We are fiercely protective of the privacy\nof our users.\nIf you use our VPN products, we protect your privacy by ensuring\nthat we do not log or record online activities that you conduct over a VPN\nconnection in any way that can be tied back to you, meaning that we do not have\nany data to share with law enforcement and government agencies who make\nrequests for information about what you were doing through a VPN connection.\nSubject to the foregoing, we may share your information if we are required to\ndo so by applicable law.\nto comply with our legal obligations.\nto comply with\nlegal process.\nand to respond to valid law enforcement requests relating to a\ncriminal investigation, or alleged or suspected illegal activity that may\nexpose Aura, you, or any of our other users to legal liability.\nIf we share\nyour information for these purposes, we limit the information shared to what is\nlegally necessary, and challenge information requests that we believe are\nunlawful, overbroad, or otherwise invalid.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To enforce our rights and prevent fraud and abuse.</strong>\nWe may share limited amounts of your information to enforce and administer our\nagreements with customers and users, and to respond to claims asserted against\nAura.\nWe may also share your information in order to protect against fraud and\nabuse against Aura, our affiliates, users and others.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>3.2.\nFree Products Only</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>Displaying Ads.</strong> We do not display third party ads in our paid products.\nWith respect to our free mobile apps and other free products, we may serve ads to users in certain regions.\nAlthough the money we make from displaying these ads offsets only part of the costs of making these apps and services available for free, we provide free apps because we believe it\u2019s important that everyone has the opportunity, regardless of their situation, to\nhave secure and private access to the internet.</p>\n<p>The ads we display in our services are supplied either by advertisers\nor affiliate networks we have relationships with, or by Google, a third party\nadvertising network (\u201c<strong>Google Ads</strong>\u201d).\nTo display these ads in our apps, we may integrate into them a software development kit (SDK), which consists of software code provided by a third party, such as an ad network.</p>\n<p>We do not provide Google Ads with any personal data about you, except\nfor an approximate city-level latitude and longitude which lets them show ads\nwhich are more relevant for your approximate geographic location.\nHowever,\nGoogle Ads may collect information through their SDKs, such as your mobile\nadvertising identifier, IP address, and device information, for the purpose of\nserving you with \u201cpersonalized\u201d ads (ads that they think are more relevant to\nyou) and measuring your response to those ads.\nIf you are using a VPN\nconnection, your IP address is hidden from ad networks and replaced with the IP\naddress of our VPN servers.\nBecause we do not provide ad networks with personal\ndata about you (apart from city-level location), Google Ads personalizes ads\nbased on information that they collect from you and that they already have\nabout you - not based on information we share with them.</p>\n<p>Google collects this information according to the Google advertising privacy notice.\nWhere an AdChoices logo appears on an ad,\nyou can click it to learn more about the ad network that provided the ad, its\nprivacy policy, and your choices regarding opting out from any personalized\nadvertising.\nIf you opt out from personalized advertising, you may still see\nnon-personalized ads.</p>\n<p>While we request you not to use ad blockers to prevent the display of\nads because that is how we support our free services, our services are able to\ncontinue functioning if you do use ad blockers.</p>\n<strong>4.\nTracking Technologies &amp.\nCookies</strong>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>4.1.\nAbout

specific\naction.\nWhen you access a page, ad, or email, or click a link, these items let us\nknow that you have accessed that page, opened an email, or clicked a link.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SDKs</strong>\n</p>\n<p>SDKs or software development kits are software code provided by our\nbusiness partners that let our software interact with the services those\npartners provide.\nFor example, in our free mobile apps, we may use an SDK to\nenable our app to serve ads from an advertising network.\nSometimes these\ninteractions will involve that business partner collecting some information\nfrom the device on which the software is run.</p>\n<strong>4.2.\nWhy we use Tracking Technologies</strong>\n<p>We use tracking technologies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide our services.</strong> Some cookies are essential for the proper\noperation of our services.\nFor example, cookies allow us to authenticate

advertising-related purposes.\n</strong>We advertise our services online with the\nhelp of third parties who show ads and marketing about us on sites around the\ninternet.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4.3.\nThird Parties</strong>\n<p>We may allow our business partners to place certain tracking technologies in our\nservices.\nThese partners use these technologies for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To provide our services.</strong> Some business partners who help us to\nprovide our services may use these technologies to support those efforts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For Analytics.</strong> To help us understand how you use our\nservices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>For Marketing.</strong> To

audiences.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>To Serve Ads.</strong> This is relevant to users of our free\nproducts only.\nAd networks and affiliate networks may use these technologies to\ndisplay ads which they think will be more relevant to you.\nFor more\ninformation, please see the \u201cDisplaying Ads\u201d section above.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>4.4.\nYour

personal data is an important aspect of protecting privacy.\nAura employs a\nrange of administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards\ndesigned to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or\nmodification.\nWe endeavor to use reasonably available state-of-the-art network\nand information security standards, protocols and technologies, including\nencryption,

companies, service providers, and partners.\nLaws in other countries\nmay be different to those that apply where you reside.\nFor example, personal\ndata collected within Switzerland or the European Economic Area (EEA) may be\ntransferred and processed outside Switzerland or the EEA for purposes described\nin this policy.\nHowever, we put in place appropriate safeguards that help to\nensure that such data receives an adequate level of protection.\nThese include\nimplementing the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses for\ntransfers of personal information between us and our business affiliates and\nassociates to which we choose to transfer the information that requires these\ncompanies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in\naccordance with European
