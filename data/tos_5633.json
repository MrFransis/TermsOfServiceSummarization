described on the Site, in connection with such Services selected by User.\nIf User is an advertiser under a \u201cpost-payment account\u201d (meaning an account in which User pays for the Services after invoicing by AppLovin), AppLovin will invoice User based on the numbers in AppLovin\u2019s online reporting system, which numbers will be deemed final and payment will be due from User within thirty (30) days of the end of each month.</p>\n<p>If User\u2019s payment method fails or User\u2019s account is past due, AppLovin may take steps to collect past due amounts using any available

planning and targeting, copywriting, site building, account management or technical modifications or technical innovations which may be charged by AppLovin to third parties from time to time.\nThe portion of Net Revenue received by User shall be determined on the first Monday of each calendar month, on which day those revenues accrued to User\u2019s account thirty (30) or more days earlier shall become eligible to be paid.\nIn the event User\u2019s earnings for any given month is less than the applicable threshold communicated to User via User\u2019s online account, AppLovin reserves the right to roll such payment over month to month until the applicable threshold is met.</p>\n<p>All payments will be calculated solely based on AppLovin\u2019s accounting.\nPayments to you may be

agreement.</p>\n<p>AppLovin reserves the right to change its fees and to institute new charges at any time, upon prior notice to User.\nTo ensure proper payment, User is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with User\u2019s account.\nAppLovin\u2019s fees do not include Taxes (defined below) and User agrees to pay all applicable Taxes imposed by any government entity in connection with User\u2019s use of the Services.\nIn the event that any authority requires that Taxes be withheld on payments made by User hereunder, User shall pay such Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority in addition to the full amount owed to AppLovin and without deduction from the amount owed to AppLovin.\nUser may provide&nbsp;AppLovin with an exemption certificate or equivalent information acceptable to the relevant taxing authority, in which case AppLovin will not charge or collect the Taxes covered by such certificate.\n\u201cTaxes\u201d shall mean any direct or indirect local, state, federal or foreign taxes, levies (including any equalization levy), duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including VAT, excise, sales, use, consumption and withholding taxes.</p>\n<p>Subject to the foregoing, AppLovin will pay User\u2019s monthly earnings within 15 days of the end of each calendar month based on the payment
