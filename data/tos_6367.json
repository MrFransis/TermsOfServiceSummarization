analyzing user behavior in aggregate for research.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.16.\nTechnical Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit our Sites, we may collect technical and navigational information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages visited, and average time spent on our Site.\nThis information may be used, for example, to alert you to software compatibility issues, or it may be analyzed to improve our web design and functionality.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.17.\nMobile Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you use the mobile versions of our Sites, we may collect the unique device identifier assigned to that device by phone makers, carriers, or makers of the operating system (the \u201cDevice ID\u201d).\nDevice IDs allow Structural and other app developers to uniquely identify your device for purposes of storing application preferences and other data.\nWe may use your Device ID for security purposes.\nFor example, if you have activated a feature that limits access to a Service from a specific device, our systems will access the Device ID from each device you attempt to access the Service with to determine if the device is the specific authorized device.\nAdditionally, we may use Device IDs to monitor suspicious activity.\nFor example, if we detect that a single account on a Site is being accessed from multiple devices, as determined by tracking the Device IDs that access an account, we may contact the user to ensure that such access has been authorized by the user.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>3.18.\nUser Feedback</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Any feedback, questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, or the like that you send to Structural will be treated as being non-confidential and nonproprietary, and Structural will be free to use such information for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services incorporating the information.</p>\n4.\nEmails from Which You May Opt-Out\n<p>Structural complies with the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003.\nStructural provides users periodic Site-related notifications, newsletters, or other information via email.\nUsers may elect to stop receiving such messages at their discretion.\nIf you no longer wish to receive periodic email updates from Structural, you may update your account preferences on the Site.\nYou may also follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each promotional email.\nHowever, please note that certain Services-related (or transactional) email messages that we send users are necessary for the proper functioning and use of the Services, and users who participate in such Services do not have the ability to opt-out of such email messages.</p>\n5.\nThird Party Providers\n<p>We may use third party service providers to help us analyze certain online activities.\nFor example, these service providers may help us measure the performance of our online promotions or determine Site activity.\nWe do not share any personally identifiable information about our users with these third parties, and these third parties do not collect such information on our behalf.</p>\n6.\nThird Party Providers\n<p>\n<strong>6.1.\nHow We Use Cookies.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To enhance your experience with our Sites, many of our pages use \u201ccookies.\u201d Cookies are text files that are placed on your computer to store your preferences or for other record-keeping purposes.\nCookies and other user tracking mechanisms (e.g., local shared objects), by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our Site.\nHowever, once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie or other tracking mechanism.\nWe may use cookies and other user tracking mechanisms, including \u201cpersistent cookies\u201d, which will remain on your computer even after you close your browser, to understand Site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our Sites.\nFor example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Site (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our Site), and to save your password in password-protected areas.\nWe also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.\nWhile most browsers are set to accept cookies and other tracking devices by default, you can set yours to refuse tracking devices or to alert you before accepting them.\nHowever, by disabling tracking devices, you may not have access to the entire set of features of our Sites.\nYour browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.2.\nOther Internet Technology.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Structural may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and similar technologies, to track your use of the Site or to track your response to email messages that we send you in connection with the Sites or Services.\nWeb beacons (sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or web bugs) are small strings of code that provide a way for us to deliver a small graphic image (usually invisible) on a web page or in an email.\nWeb beacons can recognize certain types of information on your computer such as cookies, the time and date a page is viewed, and a description of the page where the web beacon is placed.\nStructural may use web beacons to improve your experience on the Site, including to provide you with content customized to your interests and to understand whether users read email messages and click on links contained within those messages so that the Site can deliver relevant content.\nOur web beacons may collect some contact information (for example, the email address associated with an email message that contains a web beacon).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.3.\nAnalytics Software.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We use analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Applications on your mobile devices.\nThis software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded.</p>\n7.\nNo Guarantees\n<p>\n<strong>7.1.\nFactors Beyond Our Control.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>While this Privacy Statement expresses Structural\u2019s standards for protection of personally identifiable information, Structural is not in a position to guarantee that the standards will always be met.\nThere may be factors beyond our control that may result in unintentional disclosure of data.\nWe follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the User Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.\nNo method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.\nTherefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your User Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>7.2.\nCompromise or Breach.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the unfortunate event that your \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by email (at our sole and absolute discretion) to the last email address you have provided us in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances.\nprovided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation.</p>\n8.\nYour Choices &amp.\nObligations\n<p>\n<strong>8.1.\nRights to Access, Correct, or Delete Your

your own profile.\nIn addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Users copied or exported out of our Services, because this information may not be in our control.</p>\n<p>Please note:&nbsp;Information you have shared with others (for example, through profile updates, announcements, or polls) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile.\nIn addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Users copied or exported out of our Services, because this information may not be in our control.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.2.\nData Retention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We retain the personal information you provide

period of time, if requested by law enforcement.\nOur Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally
