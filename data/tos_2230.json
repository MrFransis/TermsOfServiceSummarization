about privacy.\nWe believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals.\nOur clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students.\nWe take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously.\nWe therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart.\nYou can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our Privacy Center.</p> Scope of Notice<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>This California Privacy Notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) supplements the information in our Privacy Statement and applies only to individual residents of the State of California (\u201cconsumers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d).</p>\n<p>This CA Notice describes how we (as a \u2018business\u2019) collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information of individual residents of the State of California, either online or offline, within the scope of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA).</p>\n<p>Where we provide our products and services to consumers on behalf of our clients, we are considered a \u2018service provider\u2019 under CCPA.\nIn this case, the client\u2019s privacy notice governs the use of personal information.\nFor example, when we process Student Data on behalf of our client institution, we are acting as a service provider and we retain, use and disclose the Student Data in accordance with our written agreement with the client.\nAccordingly, this Notice only reflects how we collect, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal information for our own purposes (e.g., for our websites and marketing).</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Notice, personal information does not include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Publicly available information from government

you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Information relating to our employees, contractors and other personnel (which is governed by a separate privacy notice)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we use terms that are defined in the CCPA, they have the same meaning as in the CCPA.</p> Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information<i>\n</i>\n<i>\n</i>\n<p>We collect personal information from and about you

threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights.<br>\n<em>(iii) Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.</em> WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSON AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED THE PRODUCTS FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL, OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES\u2019 INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY,

TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS OR THESE
