"https://turtlapp.com/privacy/", "xpath": "/html/body/div[2]/div", "text": " <p>Last update: <strong>December 8, 2015</strong>\n</p> Privacy <p>We have created this page to explain, very clearly and without legal speak, how\nwe collect and use your information while the Turtl app is connected to our\nservers.</p>\n<p>Note that this document will update as new features are added to Turtl.\nHowever,\nparts of this document that state that something will <em>never</em> happen will not be\nchanged in any material way other than to clarify any possible ambiguity.\nWhen\nwe say never, we mean it.</p> Information collection <p>Times when Turtl collects user information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When users join Turtl.\nThey do so with a username and password: the username\nis currently never sent to the servers, but in future versions may be sent in\nplain text to our servers.\nThe password, along with the username, create two\npieces of data: an authentication token used to verify that the user logging\nin is the same user we have on our servers, and a master key used to encrypt\nand decrypt your profile.\nThe master key is never sent outside of the Turtl\napp.\nThe authentication token is created by one-way hashing the username and\npassword and then encrypting using the master key.\nIt does not contain any\npersonally identifiable information, nor can any be reversed from the token.</li>\n<li>When users add a persona.\nPersonas allow your account, which is private by\ndefault, to be shared with by other people.\nSo when you create a persona,\nTurtl asks for an email address (required), name (optional), and in the future\npossibly more optional fields (such as an avatar photo).</li>\n<li>When you add data to your profile.\nThe notes/bookmarks/files you add will all\nbe encrypted (in the client) then sent to the Turtl service (where all your\ndata remains encrypted).\nYour data is only ever decrypted when inside the\napplication, and the only way to decrypt your profile is with your master key\nor if you purposefuly share with another person.\nYour profile cannot even be\nread by us.</li>\n</ul> Information sharing/disclosure <p>Times when Turtl shares your information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you successfully log in to your account, Turtl will download your data\nprofile (notes/bookmarks/files) to your local computer, in encrypted form,\nand then decrypt your data when it arrives.</li>\n<li>When someone is searching for your email in the sharing interface, Turtl will\nindicate whether or not the email typed in belongs to a current Turtl persona.\nHowever, one must be logged in to the Turtl service to perform this search,\nand there is no way to search multiple emails based on a wildcard.\nAn email\nmust be known beforehand.</li>\n<li>When United States law enforcement or a government agency has a court order or warrant which mandates that we share information on a specific user, we\nmust comply.\nHowever, keep in mind that your data profile remains encrypted\nduring this process.\nWe have no way to decrypt your data, and most likely\nneither does any law enforcement agency.\nWhether or not you choose to share\nyour encryption key with them is your decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The above may change, but with the restriction that Turtl will never share your\ninformation with any third party other than a law enforcement agency which has\na valid, legal court order mandating us to turn over information.\nWe will not\ngive your information to third parties.</p> Advertisement <p>Turtl has no third-party advertisements of any kind.\nTurtl will never have any\nform of third-party advertisement.\nDoing so would cripple the security measures\nTurtl takes to protect your information.</p>\n<p>At times, Turtl may advertise, endorse, or promote features or other products,\nbut at no time will any third-party advertiser be allowed to place any hooks\ninto our codebase.\nAny advertisements run on the Turtl application will be run\nby Turtl and no one else.</p> ", "created_at": "2022-01-05 23:47:57.987001", "updated_at": "2022-01-05 22:48:46.109715"}], "points": [], "urls": ["turtlapp.com"]}}
