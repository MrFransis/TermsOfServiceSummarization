&amp.\nSupport at norton.com/support.\nIf you are a U.S.\nvisitor of the Website:</p>\n<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\nYou and NortonLifeLock agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to your access to and use of the Website (a \u201c<strong>Claim</strong>\u201d) will be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.<br>\n</p>\n<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Small Claims Court</strong>.\nEither of us can seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.\nEither of us may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court in your county of residence or in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Arbitration</strong>.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and NortonLifeLock are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of&nbsp;these Terms of Use.</p>\n<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Notice of Claim</strong>.&nbsp;If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to NortonLifeLock, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim (\"<strong>Notice of Claim</strong>\").\nThe Notice of Claim to NortonLifeLock should be addressed to: General Counsel, NortonLifeLock Inc., 60 Rio Salado Pkwy #1000, Tempe AZ 85281, and should be prominently captioned \u201cNOTICE OF CLAIM.\u201d The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address You would like NortonLifeLock to use to contact you.\nIf NortonLifeLock elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to the address you provide to us in your Notice of Claim.\nA Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by NortonLifeLock, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\n(b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought (\"<strong>Demand</strong>\").\nand (c) whether you reject any subsequent modification of this Section by NortonLifeLock.</p>\n<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Arbitration Proceedings</strong>.\nIf we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or NortonLifeLock may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).\nYou may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at&nbsp;www.adr.org.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association (\"<strong>AAA</strong>\") (collectively, the \"<strong>AAA Rules</strong>\"),&nbsp;as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA.\nThe AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org.\nThe arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Use.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.\nUnless NortonLifeLock and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.\nIf your claim is for U.S.\n$10,000 or less, NortonLifeLock agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.\nIf your claim exceeds U.S.\n$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the way the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\nIf the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then We will pay you, in addition to the award, either U.S.\n$500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</strong>.\nExcept as provided in Section 16(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or NortonLifeLock and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.\nTo the extent that you or NortonLifeLock prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.\nThe parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>.\nPayment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\nYou are required to pay AAA\u2019s initial filing fee but NortonLifeLock will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the arbitration to the extent it exceeded the fee for filing a complaint in a federal or state court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County, California.\nNortonLifeLock will not seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying under the AAA Rules or these Terms of Use, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>\n<p>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>.\nYOU AND WE AGREE THAT WE EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.\nIf you have elected arbitration, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\nIf this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 (Disputes.\nMandatory Arbitration) shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<strong>Changes</strong>.\nIf we change this Section 16 after the date you first accepted these Terms, and you have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, you may reject any such change by so stating within Your Notice of Claim.\nBy failing to reject any changes to this Section 16 in Your Notice of Claim, you agree to resolve any Claim between you and us in accordance with the terms of the dispute resolution section in effect as of the date of Your Notice of Claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>17.\nEntire Agreement and Applicable Law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Except as otherwise required herein or by law, these terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America.\nIf any term in these Terms of Use is found by competent judicial authority to be unenforceable in any respect, the validity of the remainder of these Terms of Use will be unaffected, provided that such unenforceability does not materially affect the parties\u2019 rights under these Terms of Use.</p> ", "created_at": "2021-07-07 02:56:28.164812",

bankruptcy.</p>\n<strong>Retention and Deletion of Your Personal Data</strong>\n<p>We will keep your personal data on our systems as long as necessary to provide you with our Services, or for as long as we have another legitimate business purpose to do so, but not longer than permitted or required by law.\nWhen we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business reason to keep your personal data, your personal data will either be securely disposed of, or de-identified through an appropriate anonymization means, such as aggregation, truncation, or one-way hashing so it is no longer identifiable

the European Economic Area and is transferred to NortonLifeLock subsidiaries, affiliates, or third-party vendors engaged by NortonLifeLock to process such personal data on our behalf who are located

information security standards, protocols, and technologies, including encryption, intrusion detection, and data loss prevention, and we monitor our systems and data centers to comply with our

when you visit certain websites owned by third parties.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We use different kinds of cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Essential cookies</strong> are necessary to provide you with Services and features available through our websites.\nWithout these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Advertising cookies

information and content that may be of interest to you, such as promotions or offerings, when you visit third-party websites after you have left ours.\nWe do not permit these third parties to collect personal data about you on our sites beyond such cookies (e.g., email address) unless such data is provided to the third party in their role as a service provider acting solely on our behalf.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Social Media Features and Widgets</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Our websites include social media features, such as Facebook\u2019s \u201cLike\u201d button, and widgets, such as the \u201cShare This\u201d button, or interactive mini-programs that run on our sites.\nThese features are usually recognizable by their third-party brand or logo and may collect your IP address or other personal data, including which page you are visiting on our websites, and set a cookie to enable the feature to work properly.\nAny collection of information through such

Profiling</strong>\n<p>Where NortonLifeLock processes network traffic data for the purpose of network and information security based on our or our customers\u2019 legitimate interest as outlined in the corresponding section of this Statement, automated decisions concerning data elements may occasionally be made.\nThis could involve assigning relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators measured by our and our partners\u2019 cyber-threat detection engines.\nSuch indicators may be, for instance, the determination that malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL or are coming from a given IP address.\nSuch automatically assigned reputation scores may be leveraged by you, by NortonLifeLock, by our partners, and by other customers to detect, block, and mitigate the identified cyber threats.\nThey could therefore result in our Services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses.\nThis processing is intended only to protect you, NortonLifeLock, our partners, and our other customers from cyber threats.\nIf you consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact us as explained above (\u201cContact Us\u201d) to raise your concerns and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.<strong>\n<u>\n</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<strong>Children\u2019s Privacy</strong>\n<p>Our websites are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable

the Product Specific Privacy Statements for additional information.</p>\n<strong>Changes to this Statement</strong>\n<p>We reserve the right to revise or modify this Statement.\nIn addition, we may update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes to our data practices.\nIf we make any material changes in the way we collect, process, and/or share your personal data, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective.\nIn the case of a material change to our personal data processing

contacting LifeLock customer support.</p>\n<p>If you are a U.S.\ncustomer, and the dispute is not resolved through LifeLock customer support, you and LifeLock agree that any such dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Services or these Service Terms (a \"Claim\"), shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction, as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A.&nbsp.\nSmall Claims Court: You may elect to litigate your Claim in small claims court if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the dispute.</p>\n<p>You agree to bring a Claim in small claims court in your county of residence or in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.</p>\n<p>B.&nbsp.\nArbitration:&nbsp.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nYou agree that, by agreeing to these Service Terms, the U.S.\nFederal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and LifeLock are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.\nThis arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Service Terms and/or the termination of your Service.</p>\n<p>a.\nNotice of Claim:&nbsp.\nIf you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to LifeLock, by certified mail, a written Notice of Your Claim (\"Notice of Claim\").</p>\n<p>The Notice of Claim to LifeLock should be addressed to: General Counsel, LifeLock, Inc., 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, CA 94043 and should be prominently captioned \"NOTICE OF CLAIM\".</p>\n<p>The Notice of Claim should include both the mailing address and email address you would like LifeLock to use to contact you.</p>\n<p>If LifeLock elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your billing address on file.</p>\n<p>A Notice of Claim, whether sent by you or by LifeLock, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\n(b) set forth the specific amount of damages or other relief sought (\"Demand\").\nand (c) whether you reject any subsequent modification of the Dispute Resolution section by Symantec (see Section 17(B)(e)).</p>\n<p>b.\nArbitration Proceedings:&nbsp.\nIf you and LifeLock do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Claim is received, you or LifeLock may commence an arbitration proceeding (or, alternatively, file a claim in small claims court).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;You may download or copy a form of notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.\nThe arbitration will be governed by the Consumer or Commercial Arbitration Rules, as appropriate, of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") (collectively, the \"AAA Rules\"), as modified by these Service Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org.\nThe arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Service Terms.\nAll issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision.</p>\n<p>Unless LifeLock and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of Claim.</p>\n<p>If your claim is for U.S.\n$10,000 or less, LifeLock agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>If your claim exceeds U.S.\n$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>\n<p>If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of LifeLock's last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if LifeLock did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then LifeLock will pay you, in addition to the award, either U.S.\n$500 or 10% of the amount awarded, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>c.\nInjunctive and Declaratory Relief:&nbsp.\nExcept as set forth in Section 17.A., the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by you or LifeLock, and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.</p>\n<p>To the extent that you or LifeLock prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration.</p>\n<p>The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>\n<p>d.\nArbitration Fees:&nbsp.\nIf your claim for damages does not exceed $10,000, LifeLock will pay all fees imposed by the AAA to conduct the arbitration, including reimbursement of your initial filing fee, unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).\nIf your claim for damages exceeds $10,000, standard AAA Rules will govern the payment of all AAA fees, including filing, administration and arbitrator fees.</p>\n<p>e.\nClass Action Waiver:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>YOU AND LIFELOCK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</strong>.</p>\n<p>Further, if you have elected arbitration, unless both you and LifeLock agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>\n<p>f.&nbsp.\nModification of Dispute Resolution Section: Notwithstanding Section 3 or the last paragraph on the opening Section, if LifeLock changes this \"Dispute Resolution\"&nbsp;section after the date you first accepted these Service Terms, and you have not otherwise affirmatively agreed to such changes, you may reject any such change by so stating within your Notice of Claim.</p>\n<p>By failing to reject any changes to this Dispute Resolution section in your Notice of Claim, you agree to resolve any Claim between you and LifeLock in accordance with the terms of the Dispute Resolution section in effect as of the date of your Notice of Claim.</p>\n<p>g.\nSeverability:&nbsp.\nWith the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17.B.e of this Agreement (\"Class Action Waiver\"), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Service Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Service Terms shall still apply.</p>\n18.\nGeneral\n<p>Neither these Service Terms, nor any rights hereunder, may be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, by you without our prior written permission.\nAny purported assignment without such permission shall be void.\nAny waiver of our rights under these Service Terms must be in writing, signed by LifeLock, and any such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of any future breach of these Service Terms.\nIn the event any portion of these Service Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, such portion shall be severed from these Service Terms, and the remaining terms shall be separately enforced.\nYour use of the Services shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.\nThese Service Terms, and all documents incorporated into these Service Terms by reference, are the entire agreement between the parties with respect to this subject matter, and supersede any and all prior or contemporaneous or additional communications, negotiations, or agreements with respect thereto.\nOur failure to enforce any of these Service Terms is not a waiver of such term or right.\nThe proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Service Terms.\nThese Service Terms are solely and exclusively between you and LifeLock and you acknowledge and agree that (i) no third party, including a third-party partner of LifeLock is a party to these Service Terms, and (ii) no third party, including any third-party partner of LifeLock has any obligations or duties to you under these Service Terms.</p>\n<p>Copyright \u00a9 2018 LifeLock, Inc.&nbsp;<br>All Rights Reserved&nbsp;<br>Effective Date: May 29, 2018&nbsp;</p> ", "created_at": "2019-06-06
