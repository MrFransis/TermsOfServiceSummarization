<p>\n<br>\n<b>PREAMBLE</b>\n<br>\nviagogo Entertainment Inc, which is registered in Delaware, United States of America, offers a service on its Internet site at the address www.viagogo.com (hereafter, the \u201cViagogo Platform\u201d) that brings together sellers (the \u201cSellers\u201d) of tickets for shows or sporting events (the \u201cTickets\u201d) and buyers (the \u201cBuyers\u201d) for these same Tickets.\nThe Sellers and the Buyers are hereafter jointly referred to as the Members.\nThe Viagogo Platform allows contracts for the sale of Tickets to be concluded.\nHowever, the Members are the sole decision-makers in finalising the sale or purchase of the Tickets.\nThe Members\u2019 acceptance of these General Terms of Use of the Viagogo Platform allows you (\u201cYou\u201d) to access the Viagogo Platform that serves to bring together Sellers and Buyers and to make transactions on the www.viagogo.com site according to the terms defined below.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.1 Introduction.</b> Welcome to viagogo's online ticket exchange (the \"Site\").\nThese Terms and Conditions (including any documents referred to in it) (\"Agreement\") list the terms of the agreement between you and viagogo Entertainment Inc (\"viagogo\" or \"We\" or \"Us\") for the buying and selling of tickets (\"Tickets\"), and all other services that We provide (the \"Services\").\nBy using our Site, You agree to accept this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.2 Ticketing Exchange.</b> viagogo provides a service that allows members who want to buy tickets (\"Buyers\") to find members who want to sell tickets (\"Sellers\").\nviagogo does not take title to the underlying ticket and the actual transactions are between the Buyers and Sellers.\nOnce Buyer and Seller have entered into a transaction, all transactions are covered by the viagogo Guarantee.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.3 viagogo Guarantee.</b> When You purchase tickets on viagogo, viagogo guarantees that You will receive the tickets You paid for in time for the event.\nIn the rare instance that a problem arises and the original ticket Seller does not provide You with the tickets listed for sale, viagogo will, in its sole and absolute discretion, review comparably priced tickets and offer You replacement tickets at no additional cost, or viagogo will issue You a refund for the cost of the tickets.\n\"Comparably priced\" replacement tickets are determined by viagogo in its sole and absolute discretion.\nWhen You sell tickets on viagogo, provided you provide the exact tickets listed for sale and the ticket Buyer successfully gains entry to the event, viagogo guarantees that you will be paid for your sale.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>1.4 Modification.</b> If We change this Agreement, We shall post a revised version of this Agreement, which shall automatically replace the terms of this Agreement.\nThe revised version of this Agreement is automatically effective after it is initially posted on the Site.\nYour continued use of the Site and the Services following viagogo's posting of a revised Agreement will constitute Your acceptance of the revised Agreement.\nIf You do not agree with the terms of this Agreement or any revised version of this Agreement, do not continue to use the Services or this Site.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n<b>2.1 Requirements.</b> To be a member of this Site, You must agree to accept the terms in this Agreement.\nYou may only use the Services if You can legally enter into and form binding contracts.\nIf You do not qualify, do not use the Services.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.2 Registration.</b> We will not allow You to buy or sell tickets before You have registered with Us.\nTo register, You must provide your real name, address, phone number, and email address.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.3 Username and Password.</b> You will need a username and password to access the Site and use the Services.\nYou are responsible for maintaining the security of your username and password and You are responsible for any action taken under your username or password.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.4 Listing.</b> To sell tickets, a Seller lists the tickets in the Site database.\nAs part of the listing process, the Seller assigns a price to the tickets and provides information including but not limited to the event, date, section, seat, and row, and sale end date, all in accordance with the process outlined in the help pages.\nWhen listing seated tickets, all tickets in the same listing must be consecutive seats.\nIf tickets are not consecutive, then the Seller must create a separate listing.\nIf a Seller sends tickets that are not consecutive, but listed them as so, viagogo may charge the seller a replacement fee and other charges, as specified in Section 5.\n\u201cPiggyback\u201d tickets may not be sold in the same listing.\n\u201cPiggyback\u201d tickets are for seats that are directly behind each other.To list as a Seller, You must provide a valid credit or debit card.\nYou also grant Us a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, paid-up, royalty-free right and license to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish and display on the Site and on the sites of our marketing partners your descriptions of tickets listed for sale.\nThis is so we can promote the sale of tickets and items that You list for sale.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.5 Tax on Seller Proceeds.</b> The Seller is responsible for determining whether it/he/she is required to account for VAT (UK or other), GST, sales tax or other similar fees (collectively, \u201cTax\u201d) on the sale of the ticket.\nWe take no responsibility for such issues.\nIf the Seller is required to account for Tax on the sale of the ticket, the Seller should include the Tax (i.e., total) when setting ticket prices on the website.\nNote that this is separate from any Tax viagogo is required to charge on its fees.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.6 Making an Offer.</b> A member who wants to buy a ticket first scans the Site database for tickets listed by Sellers that match the Buyer's desired tickets.\nOnce the Buyer finds a matching ticket, the Buyer notifies Us with an \"offer\" that the Buyer is willing to purchase the ticket.\nNote that the Seller may or may not be required to charge you Tax on the sale of your ticket.\nThus, the ticket price shown (before our fees) may include Tax as appropriate.\nPlease note this does not include any Tax that may be payable on fees We are required to pay.\nAs a Buyer, You grant Us permission to charge your credit card, debit card, PayPal account, or bank account for the purchase of the selected tickets.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.7 Payment Authorisation.</b> When We receive an offer by credit or debit card, We obtain an authorisation from the Buyer's credit or debit card equal to the price, booking fees and delivery fees for the tickets.\nWe will also add Tax on our fees as applicable.\nThe authorisation will remain on the Buyer's credit or debit card until the sale is completed or the order is cancelled.\nWhen We receive an offer by PayPal, We will obtain an authorisation from the Buyer's PayPal account equal to the price, booking fees and delivery fees for the tickets.\nWe will also add Tax on our fees as applicable.\nWhen We receive an offer by bank transfer, We will check to see if the bank account is valid.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.8 Notification.</b> Once We obtain an authorisation from the Buyer, We notify the Seller of the sale via email and/or telephone, and We confirm to the Seller that the Buyer is willing to pay the listed price, booking fees, delivery fees, and taxes on our fees.\nPlease note, selling prices for tickets traded on viagogo may differ from their original \u2018face value\u2019 (i.e.\nthe price it is sold for on the primary market).\nAdditional information can be found in our FAQ\u2019s and on the ticket details pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.9 Seller's Confirmation Obligation.</b> Except as noted in Section 2.9 a), the Seller must confirm the order within forty eight (48) hours of the sale of the tickets.\nSellers should use our automated online confirmation process.\nSellers will be able to see the service fee and taxes on our fees before completing the sell process and committing to sell their tickets.\nSellers have forty-eight (48) hours from the time of sale of the tickets to \u201cReport a Problem\u201d if they are unable to deliver the exact tickets listed for sale.\nSellers can \u201cReport a Problem\u201d using the \u201cReport a Problem\u201d link on the online confirmation page.\nIn the case a Seller has not confirmed a sale within forty eight (48) hours, or in the case a Seller \u201cReports a Problem\u201d the Seller, including without limitation, may be subject to a replacement fee, other charges, and/or other consequences as specified in Section 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.9 a) Exception to Seller\u2019s Obligation to Confirm.</b> Sellers who commit to send tickets directly to viagogo are not required to confirm the order.\nSuch sellers have no right to \u201cReport a Problem\u201d and the order is automatically confirmed immediately after the sale.\nIf the listed ticket is not delivered, viagogo shall have the right to charge the Seller a replacement fee and other charges, as specified in Section 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.10 Collecting Payment.</b> Typically, upon the Buyer completing the transaction, We collect payment from the Buyer for the listed price, booking fees, delivery fees, and taxes on our fees.\nIn the case where multiple different Buyers are sharing the cost of a transaction and each paying part of the total amount (i.e.\na \u2018Split Payment\u2019 transaction), we collect the payments within 24 hours of the first Buyer completing the transaction.\nAt no time do We provide the Buyer's payment information to the Seller.\nThe money is paid to us, and the Seller is compensated for the sale according to their selected payment method and the payment policy in the help pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.11 Ticket Fulfillment.\n</b>Once the Seller lists tickets for sale, the Buyer purchases these tickets, and the Seller has confirmed the sale, the Seller is responsible for completing the transaction with the exact tickets the Seller has listed.\nTickets sales must be fulfilled via the delivery method indicated at the time of sale directly to the Buyer and no later than the shipping deadline communicated to the seller at the time of sale (\u201cMust Ship By Date\u201d).\n<br>\n<br> If the Seller lists tickets for sale, confirms the sale and then is unable to deliver the exact tickets listed, viagogo reserves the right to cancel the Seller\u2019s sale, find replacement tickets for the Buyer and the Sellers may be subject to a replacement fee, other charges, and/or other consequences, as specified in Section 5.\nInvalid tickets: If buyers are refused entry to the venue as a result of invalid tickets we may refund the buyer at any time.\nInvalid tickets are defined as anything where buyers are refused entry.\nWe will collect proof where this is possible but in some cases viagogo reserves the right to refund the buyer and not pay the seller even if proof of non entry is not presented.\nIn the event that an event is cancelled or re-scheduled, viagogo reserves the right to cancel a seller\u2019s transaction.\nIf for any reason your tickets are returned to Us or cannot be delivered We will attempt redelivery up to a maximum of three times.\nWe endeavour to rearrange delivery with the customer or arrange a collection point.\nIf this is also unsuccessful We will not offer a refund.\nWe attempt to ensure all tickets are delivered in time for the event, time scale permitting We may require a venue or box office collection (\u2018pick-up\u2019).\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.12 Seller Payment.</b> The Seller will be paid 5-8 working days after the event if delivery of the tickets was successful to the buyer.\nWe have the right to withhold payment or collect repayment if the event was re-scheduled or cancelled or if We have a good faith basis to believe such sales were unlawful or otherwise made in material violation of this agreement.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.13 Ticket Information.</b> Event dates, times, venues and subject matter, which are listed on the ticket, may change.\nIt is up to the Buyer to verify the most recent changes by contacting the box office or referring to official listings for any changes.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.14 Substituted Seat Locations.</b> Ticket listings are a representation of actual seat location.\nTickets may be substituted with comparable or better seat locations without the Buyers\u2019 approval.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.15 Claims under the viagogo Guarantee.</b> If You receive tickets from the Seller that are not the tickets you ordered or tickets that are invalid and not honoured at the venue, we strongly advise you to Contact Us to report the issue.\nIssues must be reported within 14 days after receiving the tickets otherwise this will no longer be covered by the viagogo Guarantee.\nShould you experience problems with your tickets on the day of the event you must contact viagogo within 48 hours of the incident to report the issue.\nIn certain circumstances, you may be required to complete a Dispute Claim Form and provide additional information in order to claim a refund.\nForms must be returned to viagogo 5 working days after receiving them, in order to apply for a refund.\nviagogo reserves the right to prohibit anyone who brings a fraudulent claim from having further access to our website.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.16 Season Cards.</b> In the event that the Buyer fails to return a Season Card to viagogo within 24 hours of the event concluding, the Buyer agrees that viagogo may charge an additional \u201cfailure to return fee\u201d of \u20ac200 per season card that is not returned to the payment method that was used to purchase the tickets.\nThis charge is in addition to the amount originally paid for the tickets.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>2.18 Merchant Description.</b> A payment to viagogo will appear on the Buyer\u2019s payment method statement as \u201cVIAGOGO EVENT

to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>receive confirmation from us that your personal information is being processed;</li>\n<li>access to your personal information.\nand</li>\n<li>certain other details in relation to how we use your personal information (which is generally included in our Privacy Notice anyway).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can request copies of paper and electronic records (including recorded calls, where applicable) about you that we hold, share or use.\nTo deal with your request, we can ask for proof of your identity and enough personal information about you to enable us to locate the personal information you have requested.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When will access not be provided?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We can only provide you with <em>your personal information</em>, not personal information about another person.&nbsp.\nAlso, where access would negatively affect another person\u2019s rights, we\u2019re not required to provide this.&nbsp.\nDue to legal privilege, we may not be able to show you anything that we learned in connection with a claim or legal proceeding.</p>\n<p>When requesting access to your personal information, to help us respond to your request quickly, please clearly set out in your request the personal information that you would like.&nbsp.\nIf this is not clear, we may need to ask for further information from you by way of clarification.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Correcting your information</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to require us to correct inaccurate personal information that we hold about you.</p>\n<p>If you tell us that the personal information we hold on you is incorrect, we will review it and if we agree with you, we will correct our records.&nbsp.\nIf we do not agree with you, we will let you know.&nbsp.\nIf you believe the records we hold on you are still incorrect, you can let us know in writing, and we will include your statement when we give your personal information to any third parties.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you believe that we hold incomplete personal information about you, you may also have the right to have the information completed, including by providing a supplementary statement.&nbsp.\nWhether or not this right applies will depend on the purposes for which your personal information is being processed.</p>\n<p>We need to notify any third parties with whom we have shared your personal information that you have made a correction request (see <strong>\n<u>Who do we share your information with?</u>\n</strong>).&nbsp.\nWe will take reasonable steps to do this, but if it is not possible or costly we may not be able to do so.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How You Can See and Correct Your Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Generally, if you ask us in writing, we will let you see the personal information that we hold about you, and/or take steps to correct any inaccurate information.</p>\n<p>Due to legal privilege, we may not be able to show you anything that we learned in connection with a claim or legal proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Erasing your information</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When can you request deletion of your personal information?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Subject to the section below <strong>\n<u>When can we refuse erasure requests?</u>\n</strong>, you have a right to have your personal information erased, and to prevent further processing of your personal information, where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the personal information is no longer necessary for the purpose it was originally collected/processed,</li>\n<li>you withdraw your consent (where consent was previously provided and required for us to process the information),</li>\n<li>you object to the processing, as long as our legitimate interests in processing your personal information don\u2019t take priority over your objection,</li>\n<li>we\u2019ve been processing your personal information unlawfully, or</li>\n<li>your personal information has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>When can we refuse erasure requests?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The right to erasure does not apply where your information is processed for certain specified reasons, including to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>\n<p>More importantly, if we have to erase your data we will not be able to continue to provide you with our services, so please carefully consider any request to erase your personal information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do we have to tell other recipients of your personal data about your erasure request?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you request that your personal information is deleted, and we have provided that information to any third parties (see <strong>\n<u>Who do we share your information with?</u>\n</strong>), we need to inform them about your erasure request, so they can also erase the personal information in question.&nbsp.\nWe will take reasonable steps to do this, but it may not always be possible.</p>\n<p>Third parties can also refuse erasure requests if one of the exemptions above applies (for example where third parties need your information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Restricting processing of your information</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When is restriction available?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to restrict the processing of your personal information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>where you consider the information we hold to be inaccurate, in which case we have to restrict any processing while we verify the accuracy of your personal information,</li>\n<li>when the processing we are carrying out is unlawful and you request us to restrict processing, rather than erasing your personal information,</li>\n<li>if we no longer need the personal information, but you need it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim, or</li>\n<li>while we are considering our legitimate interests for processing your personal information to which you have objected in the circumstances detailed in paragraph (a) of <strong>\n<u>Objecting to processing</u>\n</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>What happens while processing is restricted?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We can store your personal information, but we cannot carry out any further processing of it without your consent (unless processing is required in connection with legal claims, to protect another person\u2019s rights or on important public interest grounds).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do we have to tell other recipients of your personal data about the restriction?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Where we have disclosed your relevant personal information to third parties, we need to inform them about the restriction on the processing of your information, so that they do not continue to process it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll take reasonable steps to do this, but it may not always be possible.</p>\n<p>We will also let you know if we decide to lift a restriction on processing.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Taking your personal data with you</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>When does the right to data portability apply?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>The right to data portability only applies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to personal data you\u2019ve provided to us (i.e.\nnot any other information),</li>\n<li>where we are processing your personal information because you have provided your consent for us to do so, or under a contract with you.\nand</li>\n<li>when processing is carried out by automated means.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>When can we refuse requests for data portability?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We can refuse your data portability request if the processing does not satisfy the above criteria.&nbsp.\nAlso, if the personal information concerns more than one individual, we may not be able to transfer the information to you if doing so would prejudice the other person\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<u>Objecting to processing</u>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You can object to processing in the following circumstances:</p>\n<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Legitimate interests</u>\n</p>\n<p>You have the right to object at any time to processing of personal information concerning you which is carried out because of our legitimate interests.</p>\n<p>If we can show compelling legitimate grounds for processing your personal information which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or we need your personal information to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, we can continue to process it.&nbsp.\nProcessing of your personal information will be restricted while we make this assessment (see <strong>\n<u>Restricting processing of your information</u>\n</strong>).\nOtherwise, we must stop using the relevant personal information.</p>\n<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp.\n<u>Direct marketing </u>\n</p>\n<p>You can object at any time to your personal information being used for direct marketing purposes (including profiling

technologies</p>\n<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website.\nCookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie.\nCookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user\u2019s device and to remember your actions and preferences (such as login details, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time.\n<br>\n<br>\nWeb beacons (also known as internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs) are a similar technology which typically uses transparent graphic images placed on a site to gather information about a user.\nWeb beacons are used in combination with cookies to measure the actions of visitors on websites.\nWe make use of both cookies and web beacons when you visit our website, and refer to the technologies together as \u201ccookies\u201d throughout this policy.</p>\n<p> First and Third Party Cookies</p>\n<p>Cookies can be \u2018first party\u2019 or \u2018third party\u2019, depending on the website or domain placing the cookie.\nOn our website, first party cookies are cookies set by viagogo and information is collected and used by viagogo, in accordance with our Privacy Policy.\nThird party cookies are cookies that are set by a company other than viagogo, and information collected is controlled by that other company.\nFor more information on third party cookies used by viagogo, see the \u2018\u201danalytical cookies\u201d and \u201cadvertising cookies\u201d sections below.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe use cookies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep your browser active (session) and cookies that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent).\nYou

cookies used on this site</p>\n<p>There are different types of cookies, and these different kinds of cookies serve different purposes for viagogo and the third parties who place cookies on our site.\nAlthough these cookies mainly work in the same way there are some differences, and we\u2019ve set out below the four categories of cookies we use on our website.\n<br>\n<br>\n</p>\n<li>\n<b>Strictly necessary cookies.</b> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website.\nThey include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, add items to your basket or to make payments via our website.\nWe do not require your consent in order to place these cookies, and they provide essential website functionality and without them, you would be unable to use our website and services.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<b>Functionality cookies.</b> These are used to recognise you and choices you make when you return to our website.\nThis enables us to enhance and personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region and your log-in information).\nWhen you first access our website, we ask for your consent to place functionality cookies on your device.\n</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<b>Analytical/performance cookies.</b> These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it, including items that have been clicked on and the individual pages viewed.\nThis helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.\nThese cookies may be provided by our third party analytic provider, Google Analytics, but any information collected is only used by viagogo for purposes related to improving our website.\nWhen you first access our website, we ask for your consent to place analytical/performance cookies on your device.</li>\n<br>\n<br>\n<li>\n<b>Advertising cookies.</b> We allow third parties such as Google and Doubleclick by Google to place cookies on your device in order to show you online advertising on other (non-viagogo) websites that you visit.\nThese third parties will collect information about you (such as pages you have viewed and events you may be interested in) in order to select and serve relevant adverts to you.\nThe information collected by these advertising cookies will be controlled by the relevant third party and will not be provided to viagogo (except as part of statistical information we receive).\n</li>\n<br>\n<br>\nFurther information about Google\u2019s and Doubleclick\u2019s use of cookies to deliver advertising content can be found on Google\u2019s website here, and to opt-out of Google\u2019s and Doubleclick\u2019s use of cookies, you can control your Google advertising settings here.\n<br>\n<br>\nOther third party advertising cookies are placed by Awin.com and, if using the Brazilian version of our website, Awin.com\u2019s affiliate Zanox.br (further information on Awin.com\u2019s use of cookies can be found in section 2.3 here).\nIf you are using the Japanese language versions of our website, additional cookies will be placed by A8.net.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen you first access our website, we ask for your consent to place advertising cookies on your device.\nYou can find more information about the individual cookies we use, the purposes for which we use them and the duration of the cookies we use here.<p>\n</p>\n<p> How to control and delete cookies</p>\n<p>When you first use our website, you will see a \u201cpop up\u201d cookies notice.\nBy using our website after accepting the cookies notice, or by browsing our website after you have been presented with this notice, you agree to us placing cookies on your device in accordance with the terms of this Cookies Policy.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe majority of web browsers accept cookies, but you can usually change the web browser\u2019s settings to refuse new cookies, disable existing ones or simply let you know when new ones are sent to your device.\nIf you do not consent to our use of any of the cookies listed above, please disable them following the below instructions so that cookies from our website cannot be placed on your device.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the \u201cHelp\u201d, \u201cTools\u201d or \u201cEdit\u201d

can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, which will prevent your browser from sending information to Google Analytics.\n<br>\n<br>\nIn addition, disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete the cookie from your device.\nyou will need to do this yourself from within your browser.</p>\n<p> Changes to our use of cookies</p>\n<p>Any changes to our use of cookies for
