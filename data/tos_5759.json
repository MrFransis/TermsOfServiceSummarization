ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To process and send Voter Members merchandise redeemed with their TW Points,</li>\n<li>To process and bill Business Members for the purchase of business packages,</li>\n<li>By TW

email address.</li>\n<li>TW has various checks and balances to determine if a Voter Member is random clicking and or using computerized techniques to perform automated voting on online surveys.\nThese techniques will raise a flag in the Voter Member Site profile, only accessible by the Site administrators.\nVoter Members are subject to TW reward forfeiture and account closure as per the Terms and Conditions.</li>\n<li>PS may also share your personal (but non-identifiable) data with our clients who request this information for use in aggregate analysis.\nFor example, PS may provide a client with data collected from a recent survey, with variables such as age, household income, or gender from the registration survey appended to the file.\nThis is primarily designed to save our panelists time and effort, so they do not need to re-answer these questions on each and every survey.\nThis appended data, however, will never include personally identifiable information such as your full name, mailing address, or email address.</li>\n</ul>\nDo Business Members receive my personal information connected with my online survey responses?\n<p>No.\nYour Account Information is not disclosed to Business Members who send you surveys through the TW system.\nRather, TW sends the Surveys and Promotional Emails on their behalf.\nA Voter Member's answer to a survey is not disclosed by TW to Business Members unless they ask for personally identifiable information in the survey and you consent by responding with this information.\nAny demographic information given to Business Members regarding the responses to their survey questions is aggregated and not personally identifiable.\nCross tab reporting is available to the Business Member, however there is no voter id, name, email reference provided, unless the Voter provides this information themselves by inputting this as part of an answer.\nA Voter Member can also let others know his/her answer if they do so in writing through a blog comment post on the Site or through other means by the Voter Member directly when answering a survey.\nTo illustrate: If a Business Member is interested in internet usage, they may post a survey which asks Voter Members questions like \"How much time do you spend on the internet a week, that is not work or school related?\" Answer options might be in ranges like 0 to 5 hours, 6 to 10 hours, etc.\nTW tabulates the results which will then be available to the Business Member by broad categories such as gender, age, country, state, ethnicity and marital status or by answer when crosstab reporting is used.\nResults will not be provided based on email, personal or user name, or telephone number.\nCross tab reporting is available to the Business Member, however there is no voter id, name, email reference provided, unless the Voter Member provides this information themselves by inputting this as part of an answer.</p>\nDoes PS disclose my personal information to third

of such information to providing services on PS's behalf.\nThese service providers may be in another country, and the personal information may be subject to disclosure in accordance with the
