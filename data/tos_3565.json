Platform Access Agreement\nDate of Last Revision: August 12,&nbsp;2020\n<p>Notice: this Client Platform Access Agreement is a substantial revision from the prior Toptal on-line agreement entitled

Platform portions of https://www.toptal.com.</p> 1.\nToptal Properties: Description of Platform and Matching Service.\n<p>Toptal, LLC (\u201cToptal\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) provides a network (\u201cNetwork\u201d) of independent contractors who provide software engineering or other professional services (each a \u201cTalent\u201d and the services they provide, the \u201cTalent

Policy\nLast Updated May 7,&nbsp;2021\n1.\nIntroduction <p>Welcome to the Toptal website or mobile application (<strong>\u201cSite\u201d</strong>).\nToptal LLC (<strong>\u201cToptal\u201d</strong>, \u201c<strong>we</strong>\u201d, \u201c<strong>us</strong>\u201d, and/or \u201c<strong>our</strong>\u201d) operates this Site, and its mobile application, to provide our users (\u201c<strong>you</strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>your</strong>\u201d) with information about Toptal and its platform.</p>\n<p>Toptal is used by professional freelancers (\u201c<strong>Freelancers</strong>\u201d) who wish to offer their development, engineering and other services (\u201c<strong>Services</strong>\u201d) and clients who need the Services (\u201c<strong>Clients</strong>\u201d).\nFreelancers that have passed our screening process and are admitted to our network of professional Freelancers (\u201c<strong>Network</strong>\u201d) are referred to as <strong>\u201cTalent\u201d</strong>.\nFor purposes of this policy the term \u201cFreelancers\u201d is broader in scope and includes both Talent and Freelancers who are not Talent.\nThe Personal Data we receive from Freelancers and Clients and how we handle it differs, so we explain our data practices for Freelancers and Clients in two distinct sections below.\nNavigate to the section that applies to you: Freelancers.\nClients.</p> 2.\nScope <p>This Privacy Policy sets out how Toptal collects, retains, and uses information, including personal data (\u201c<strong>Personal

users of Toptal software offerings such as our image sharing and editing tool Collabshot, affiliated sites, and data that Toptal collects in-person, for instance, at business conferences and trade shows.</p> 3.\nFreelancers 3.1.\nInformation We Collect A.\nInformation That You Provide To Us <p>When you apply as a Freelancer on the Site, you are asking to be admitted to our Network.\nIn order to admit you to the Network and match your qualifications with our Client\u2019s needs, we need to perform a screening process, which evaluates your language skills, personality, domain-specific knowledge, competence and professionalism.\nWe may also need to screen potential Freelancers for specific technical skills, as required by our Clients.\nIn this context, you will be asked to provide information about yourself, which includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>your name</li>\n<li>contact information</li>\n<li>address</li>\n<li>location</li>\n<li>work experience</li>\n<li>education</li>\n<li>photo</li>\n<li>social network information</li>\n<li>family information</li>\n<li>billing information</li>\n<li>identification</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our provider of background check services may collect additional data about you (including information about criminal convictions or offenses) if and when we undertake vetting/background checks.\nIf applicable to you, your consent to the collection of such additional data will be solicited at such time, pursuant to applicable laws.</p>\n<p>When you participate in the community of Toptal\u2019s experts on our

the Services.\nthis profile is searchable and may be viewed by Clients seeking Freelancers.\nOur mobile application is also accessible by members of our Talent network.\nThe mobile application may collect location information in an effort to tailor the user experience.</p>\n<p>Once you are admitted to the Network and you are matched with a Client, we will receive from our Clients information regarding the performance of your services to that Client, as necessary for maintaining standards of integrity and excellence in our Network.</p>\n<p>In addition, Toptal may record video and/or phone calls for quality assurance and training purposes.</p> B.\nInformation Obtained From Third Parties <p>We collect information about you that we receive from our affiliates, such as TopTracker LLC, in relation to the TopTracker application which helps you keep track of how you spend your time.\nPlease refer to the TopTracker privacy policy for information regarding the scope of collected data.\nThe
