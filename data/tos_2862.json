Arbitration</p>\n<p>15.1 Generally.\nIn the interest of resolving disputes between you and Aura in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Aura agree that any and all disputes arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or your use of the Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration.\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.\nArbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts.\nArbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\nOur agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p>15.2 No class actions or jury trials.\nThis Arbitration Agreement involves interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (\u201cFAA\u201d), and not by state law.\nIf you or we elect to resolve a dispute by arbitration, neither you nor we will be able to have a court or jury trial or participate in a class action or class arbitration.\nOther rights that you and we would have if you or we went to court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights.\nYou and we each understand and agree that by allowing each other to elect to resolve any dispute through individual arbitration, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR JURY TRIAL.\nIF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION, THAT DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING.\nThe arbitrator(s) may not consolidate the claims of multiple parties, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>\n<p>15.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice.\nProcess.&nbsp;A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (\u201cNotice\u201d).\nThe Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute.\nand (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\u201cDemand\u201d).\nWe agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Aura may commence an arbitration proceeding.\nDuring the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Aura shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.\nprovided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Aura shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, or (ii) the greatest amount offered by Aura in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator\u2019s award, whichever is greater.</p>\n<p>15.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Procedure Generally.&nbsp;Arbitrations shall be administered by the JAMS (\u201cJAMS\u201d) pursuant to the applicable JAMS rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated.\nYou may obtain information about arbitration, arbitration procedures and fees from JAMS by calling 800-352-5267 or visiting http://www.jamsadr.com/.\nIf JAMS is unable or unwilling to arbitrate a dispute, then the dispute may be referred to any other arbitration organization or arbitrator we both agree upon in writing or that is appointed pursuant to section 5 of the FAA.\nThe arbitrator shall be authorized to award any relief that would have been available in court, provided that the arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to you and us alone, except as otherwise specifically stated herein.\nNo arbitration decision will have any preclusive effect as to non-parties.\nThe arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be final and binding.\nYou and we agree that this Arbitration Agreement extends to any other parties involved in any Claims, including but not limited to affiliated companies and vendors.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall take precedence over the rules of the arbitration organization or arbitrator in the event of any conflict.\n</p>\n<p>15.5 Fees.\nIn the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, Aura will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the Rules.\nAny arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Herndon, Virginia for United States residents, and at a location to be mutually agreed upon for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for US $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the Rules.\nIf the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the Rules.\nIn such case, you agree to reimburse Aura for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the Rules.\nRegardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.\nThe arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p>15.6 Enforceability.\nIf Section 15.2 above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 15 will be null and void.</p>\n<p>16.\nMiscellaneous.</p>\n<p>16.1 Assignment.\nThis Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Aura without restriction.\nAny assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void.</p>\n<p>16.2 Entire Agreement.\nThis Agreement (including any documents incorporated here by reference) constitutes the entire agreement between you and Aura concerning its subject matter, and it supersedes any other prior or contemporaneous agreements or terms, written or oral.\n</p>\n<p>16.3 &nbsp;Force Majeure.\nNeither Aura nor you will be liable for inadequate performance to the extent caused by events beyond the reasonable control of a party, which may include denial-of-service attacks, internet disturbance, strikes, riots, pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters, acts of God, war, terrorism, and governmental action.</p>\n<p>16.4 Governing Law.&nbsp;This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, exclusive of its choice of law principles.</p>\n<p>16.5 &nbsp;Interpretation.\nThis Agreement was prepared and written in English.\nAny non-English translations of this Agreement which may be

interpretation of particular provisions.\nThe use of the words \"includes,\" \"including,\" \"such as,\" \"for example,\" and similar terms are deemed not to limit what else might be included.</p>\n<p>16.6 Jurisdiction.\nYou agree that in the event of a dispute that is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 15, or if Section 15 is found to be unenforceable, any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement or Aura will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the Herndon, Virginia, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.</p>\n<p>16.7 Notice.&nbsp;All notices must be in writing and will be deemed given when: (a) personally delivered, (b) verified by written receipt, if sent by postal mail with verification of receipt service or courier, (c) received, if sent by postal mail without verification of receipt, or

reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>\n<p>16.9 Survival.\n&nbsp;Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason, the following provisions will survive such termination or expiration: Sections 4, 5.3, and 10
