or improve the Service, for example by storing your password or delivering relevant advertising to you when you use the Service.\nWe may also work with our Partners to use such technologies to help

companies may collect and use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to or use of the Service and other websites and apps.\nThe use of cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by such Partners and advertisers is not in Patch\u2019s control and is subject to the privacy policies of such third parties.</p>\n<p>By accessing or using the Service, you consent to such use of cookies and other technologies, and similar technologies that may be developed in the future, by Patch and its Partners.\nYou may be able to set your browser to disable cookies or LSOs, or to refuse certain types of cookies or warn you before accepting cookies.\nLSOs using Adobe Flash can be managed using Flash management tools on the&nbsp;Adobe website.\nHowever, doing so may mean that certain parts of the Service may not work for you.\nFurther, \u201copting out\u201d does not prevent the display of all advertising.\nSome Partners may use technologies other than cookies to recognize your computer or device or to collect information about your use of the Service or other websites or services, and you may not be able to block use of such technologies.\nWhile some browsers may transmit \u201cdo not track\u201d signals to websites and online services, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, and

your IDFA or Android Advertising ID, and other information about how your device interacts with the Service.\nSDKs allow app developers to enable advertising, collection of data and related services

widgets, SDKs, IP addresses and similar technologies when you access or use the Service or see advertisements provided through the Service for purposes such as providing you with advertising that is relevant to you, analytics purposes (for example to determine whether you later purchased a product or service in an advertisement you clicked on or took some other action), providing content from a content provider\u2019s server, and offering content or services based on the content of the pages you visit or other criteria.\nIn some cases, because you must request content from the Partner\u2019s server or otherwise communicate directly with the Partner\u2019s server the Partner can collect your information, such as your IP address or browser information, as if you had visited their website or used their app directly.\nIn connection with the foregoing, Patch Partners may collect information about the content or ads you viewed, how long you spent on different pages or parts of the Service, how you arrived at specific pages on the Service, and how you responded to ads that you saw.\nPartners may also collect information about other apps on your devices, the websites you visit, your

Although you may be tempted to skim over some of this\u2014indeed, there is some \u201clegalese\u201d involved\u2014we hope you\u2019ll read it through.\nWe\u2019ll do our best to help you understand everything so you can feel good about using and contributing to Patch.\n</p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, the Patch.com desktop and mobile websites (and any other versions of the Patch.com website) (the \u201cSites\u201d), the Patch mobile applications (the \u201cApps\u201d) and other services, such as emails, provided by Patch are a service (the \u201cService\u201d) designed to make your life better.\nUnless we state otherwise, any new features or functionality provided on the Sites and/or Apps are also part of the Service.\nThe Service is operated by Planck, LLC, d/b/a Patch Media (\u201cPatch\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d).\nBy accessing or using the Service, whether through a personal computer, mobile device or any other means, or submitting any content for publication or distribution, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and by the Patch Privacy Policy, the Patch Community Guidelines and by any other guidelines and supplemental terms provided to you with respect to your use of the Service.\nWe ask that you read these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy and\tPatch\tCommunity\tGuidelines and any other guidelines and supplemental terms carefully before registering or using the Service or submitting any content.\nIf you do not accept these Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy, and\tPatch\tCommunity\tGuidelines or any other guidelines or supplemental terms, we promise not to get mad.\nBut in that case, you may not use the Service or submit any content.\n</p>\n<p>Just like your local community, Patch and the Service are growing and changing every day, and thus the Terms of Use are subject to change by Patch at any time.\nThe most current version of these Terms of Use can always be viewed on the Sites, and we will always let you know when the latest update occurred \u2013 just check the \u201cEffective Date\u201d on the Terms of Use posted on the Sites.\nBy using the Service or submitting any content after the latest Effective Date you have accepted the updated Terms of Use.\n</p>\nUse of the Service\n<p>\nYou may use the Service solely for personal and non-commercial purposes.\nThat is to say: While you can use the Service to promote your own business or activities as allowed by Patch, by submitting a classified ad or business listing or promoting an event in accordance with these Terms of Use, you can\u2019t use the Service itself to make a living, for example by distributing or repurposing content you find on the Service or for any other purpose or in any other manner, unless you enter into a separate written agreement with us that says you can.\nYou may download and print a single copy of the content of the Service solely for your personal, non-commercial use and provided that you do not delete or modify any copyright or other proprietary notice.\nKeep in mind that all applicable laws, rules and regulations and any agreements or terms with third parties to which you are subject still apply.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to comprehensively cover your community, the Service contains information on businesses, establishments, public services and other third parties, as well as news, feature stories, images, video, audio and other materials.\nThe Service may provide you with other ways to access and use such information and materials\u2014for instance, we give you the option to receive our emails and bookmark our items in other social networking services.\nWe try to ensure everything passes muster, but Patch makes no guarantee that any information provided or accessed on or through the Service is accurate, current or complete.\nYour use of the information we provide or that you obtain on or through the Service is at your own risk.\nIf you think something looks fishy, please let us know.\nYou agree that you will not hold Patch liable for any inaccurate, incomplete, outdated or missing information provided on or through the Service.\n</p>\nRegistration\n<p>\nWe want everyone to enjoy Patch, so you may use some parts of the Service without registration (i.e., without signing up with a name, email address and password).\nIf you wish, you can register for a \u201cread-only\u201d Patch profile account.\nA \u201cread-only\u201d account does not allow you to post on the Service or use some other parts of the Service, but it does let you tell us a bit about yourself \u2013 your name and email address \u2013 and it lets you \u201cpick your Patch\u201d so that we can show your local news on the homepage when you are signed in.\nIf you want to post on the Service, or access or use some other parts of the Service, you will need to register for a \u201cverified\u201d Patch profile account, which requires verification, through Facebook or some other specified means, that you are who you say you are.\nYou can also change your \u201cread-only\u201d profile to a verified profile by verifying your identity.\nWe\tstrongly encourage you to use your real name and current \"hometown\" \u2013 that way, your neighbors can get to\tknow you,\tand\twe require that\tyou provide\tyour\town, valid\temail\taddress\twhen you register, whether for a \"read-only\u201d account or\ta\tverified account.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhatever type of account you choose, remember that your account is for your sole, personal use.\nYou may not allow others to use your account and you may not assign or otherwise transfer your account to any other person or entity.\nIf someone else wants an account, they can easily sign up themselves.\nYou are responsible for the security of your password and will be solely liable for any use or unauthorized use of your account or otherwise under such password.\nTherefore, if you share a computer with others or want to help make your account more secure, don\u2019t allow your Internet browser or any other service or technology to automatically save your password.\nIf you do allow your password to be saved, it may be saved for up to sixty (60) days before you need to sign in again.\nAlso, don\u2019t write your password on a Post-It note and leave it on your desk for all to see \u2013 but you knew that!\n</p>\nYour License to Patch\n<p>\nPatch is built to let you do fun things such as upload and share photos, videos, text, and other materials and information (all of which we call \u201cYour Content\u201d).\nWhen you do this, you own Your Content except as you may otherwise agree.\nHowever (and here comes some legalese), by sharing or uploading Your Content, you grant Patch (and any of Patch\u2019s contractors and licensors with respect to any of Your Content you provide to them through your use of our Site) a perpetual, worldwide license to use, redact, republish, copy, perform, modify, adapt and distribute Your Content and your screen name, including, without limitation, any intellectual property contained therein, in any medium now known or hereinafter developed, without payment or compensation to you and without seeking any further approval from you.\nWe may also use your name, your town\tor \u201cPatch\u201d, likeness, publicly accessible biographical data and any other information in connection with such use of Your Content.\nYou acknowledge that our use of Your Content may include licensing Your Content to third parties and/or using Your Content for advertising purposes.\nIn no event will we be required to seek your approval or provide you with any compensation in connection with any such use.\nYou warrant (that is, promise us) that Your Content complies with these Terms of Use and that nothing contained within Your Content would require us to seek permission of a third party in order to use Your Content as described in these Terms of Use.\nThis may sound like a lot, but these rights are primarily designed to give us legal protection\u2014we're not looking to go into the \u201cyou business\u201d (as they say in Hollywood).\n</p>\nAcceptable Use\n<p>\nWhile we encourage you, to be honest and post what\u2019s on your mind, communities thrive when people care about each other, and as such, Patch expects all of its users to be respectful of others.\nThis means that whether you are being complimentary or critical, whether you are agreeing or disagreeing with the subject of an article or another user\u2019s comment, you should act in a civil manner and refrain from personal attacks \u2013 after all, these are your neighbors.\n</p>\n<p>\nPatch is under no obligation to enforce the Patch Terms of Use on your behalf or based on a claim by you that another user has breached any of these Terms of Use.\nWhile we encourage you to let us know if you believe that another user has breached these Terms of Use or has engaged in other unacceptable behavior by reporting it to support@patch.com, Patch will make the sole determination, in Patch\u2019s sole discretion, as to whether Your Content or any other content is acceptable for the Service.\n(Someone has to be in charge, right?)\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause Patch provides a platform for wide-ranging commentary \u2013 both positive and negative \u2013 by members of local communities, you should keep in mind that, even if you disagree with or object to a comment or review, Patch typically does not remove comments or reviews in response to requests from users.\nPatch\u2019s role is not to arbitrate disagreements between community members and local businesses, or among community members.\nAnd (for the lawyers out there) the law doesn\u2019t require us to perform that role in order to keep offering what we think is a valuable community service: providing a platform for community discussion, debate and expression of opinions on the topics at hand.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy using the Service, you agree that you will not hold Patch responsible or liable for any content or information from other users that you access on or through the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou are solely responsible for Your Content that you post on the Service or transmit to other users.\nWithout limitation, you agree that Your Content that you post or transmit to other users using the Service will not include any content that:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> is defamatory, abusive, obscene, profane or offensive.\n</li>\n<li> infringes or violates another party's intellectual property rights (such as music, videos, photos or other materials that you do not own, or for which you do not have written consent from the owner of such materials to post on the Service).\n</li>\n<li> violates anyone\u2019s right of publicity or right of privacy.\n</li>\n<li> is threatening or harassing, or that promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual.\n</li>\n<li> promotes or encourages violence.\n</li>\n<li> is inaccurate, false or misleading in any way.\n</li>\n<li> is illegal or promotes any illegal activities.\n</li>\n<li> promotes illegal or unauthorized copying of another person's copyrighted work or links to sites that do so, or provides information to circumvent security measures.\n</li>\n<li> contains \u201cmasked\u201d profanity (e.g., F@&amp;#) </li>\n<li> contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.\nor </li>\n<li> contains, or includes links to, any \u201cjunk mail,\u201d \u201cspam,\u201d \u201cchain letters,\u201d \u201cpyramid schemes,\u201d or any other form of solicitation not specifically allowed on the Service.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nYou might want to boil it down to three main principles: \u201cKeep it clean,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t try to trick or steal from people,\u201d and \u201cTreat others as you\u2019d like to be treated.\u201d Easy, right?\n</p>\n<p>\nPatch is under no obligation to screen or monitor any content, but we may review content from time to time at our sole discretion to determine compliance with these Terms of Use.\nPatch will make all determinations as to what content is appropriate at our sole discretion.\nWe may include, edit or remove any content at any time, for any reason, and without notice.\n</p>\n<p>\nVariety is the spice of digital life, so understand that when using the Service, you will be exposed to content and communications from a variety of sources, and that Patch is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to any such content.\nAnd, just like when you visit any website, by using Patch you acknowledge that you may be exposed to content that is inaccurate or that you find to be offensive, indecent or objectionable.\nIf you object to this possibility, you should not use the Service.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn keeping with the \u201cDon\u2019t trick anyone\u201d principle, you may not use spiders, robots, data mining techniques or other automated devices or programs to catalog, download or otherwise reproduce, store or distribute content available on the Service.\nFurther, you may not use any such automated means to manipulate the Service or attempt to exceed the limited authorization and access granted to you under these Terms of Use.\nAnd, you may not resell use of or access to the Service to any third party.\n</p>\nLocal Deals, Local Directory, Classifieds and Promoted Events\n<p>\nPatch does not charge you a fee for access to or use of most of the Service.\nHowever, everyone needs to make a living, and use of some parts of the Service, such as certain categories of classifieds, local directory listings or promoting an event, may require a fee We will let you know if a fee is required at the time you post the classified, listing or event or use any other part of the Service.\nSorry, but unless we specifically agree otherwise, all fees are non-refundable \u2013 even if we remove the classified, listing or event, for example .\nPayment may made be by valid credit card or by another payment method allowed by Patch.\nBy making a purchase, you authorize Patch to bill your selected payment method.\nAll amounts are in US dollars, and any tax is additional.\nAll classified advertising, local directory listings, and events posted to the calendar are subject to these Terms of Use, in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other terms or conditions made available at the time a classified, listing or event is posted.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs much as we love a good haggle, we stay out of transactions in our local deals and classifieds and events posted on our calendar.\nPatch does not control the content of classifieds or event promotions, or any other content posted by users of the Service, nor do we guarantee the accuracy or quality of their content.\nTransactions are solely between buyers and sellers, and Patch does not review or confirm local deals or classifieds offered on the Service, or review or confirm any events posted on the calendar.\nYou agree that any dispute between you (as the buyer or seller of any item or poster of or attendee at an event) and another party with whom you interact as a result of or in connection with any local deal, classified or calendar event does not involve Patch, and you hereby release Patch from any claims, and agree to indemnify Patch from any claims, based on or resulting from your, or anyone else\u2019s, acts or omissions in connection with local deals, classifieds or events.\nSo, play nice and leave us out of your transactions.\n</p>\n<p>\nMany laws and regulations in various jurisdictions regulate the types of goods and services bought, sold, or exchanged in those jurisdictions, as well as the manner in which they are bought, sold, or exchanged.\nIf you post a classified or event on Patch, you are responsible for complying with such laws and regulations.\nAnd, you wouldn\u2019t want to be a law-breaker, now, would you?\n</p>\n<p>\nBelow for your convenience is a partial list of prohibited items and services \u2013 that is, items and services that you may not sell, buy or exchange through the Service, because they are against the law and/or against Patch policies:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Obscene material or pornography.\n</li>\n<li> Offers or solicitation of illegal prostitution.\n</li>\n<li> Adult products or services.\n</li>\n<li> Weapons, explosives,

content that wrongfully discriminate.\nThis means that your housing, employment and other classifieds should not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, color, national origin, citizenship, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family or marital status, disability or any medical or genetic condition.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you see a classified or event that violates these Terms of Use or any applicable law, please contact support@patch.com.\n</p>\n<p>\nRemember, folks: you can never be too careful with your money \u2013 or yourself.\nWatch out for scams, and take common sense precautions just as you would in any situation.Here are some suggested basic safety precautions that may help keep you safe:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Meet the seller/buyer in person.\n</li>\n<li> Meet them in a public place or bring a friend.\n</li>\n<li> Tell a friend or family member where you are going.\n</li>\n<li> Examine the item before you buy.\n</li>\n<li> Keep payment simple.\nNever wire funds or accept cashier or certified checks or money orders.\n</li>\n<li> Limit sharing of personal or financial information.\n</li>\n<li> If the offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.\n</li>\n</ul>\nTermination of Access\n<p>\nWe want to keep Patch a safe and friendly place, so in addition to any right or remedy that may be available to us under these Terms of Use or applicable law, we may suspend, limit or terminate your account, or all or a portion of your access to the Service, at any time with or without notice and with or without cause.\nIn addition, we may refer any information on illegal activities, including your identity, to the proper authorities \u2013 that includes the police and/or your parents take any other action we believe to be in the interest of Patch and users of the Service.\n</p>\nPrivacy\n<p>\nThe privacy of your personally identifiable information is very important to us.\nFor more details on what information we collect and how we use and disclose such information, please read our Privacy Policy.\nThe Service is not directed at children, and Patch will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from any child under age 13.\n</p>\nLinks\n<p>\nIn order to provide you with as much relevant information as possible, the Service may contain links to other websites not provided by us.\nThe links may include listings that provide you with further information, or links that have been included in materials uploaded to the Service by a party other than Patch.\nBe aware when you leave our Service and read the terms and conditions and privacy statements of each and every website you visit, even if they are not as charming as ours.\nWe are not responsible for the practices or the content of such other websites or services.\nDespite any links that might exist on the Service, we do not endorse and are not affiliated with such third parties.\n</p>\nOur Proprietary Rights\n<p>\nWe work hard on our

LICENSEES AND LICENSORS.\n(Sorry to yell at you.) Back to our inside voice: If any part of these warranty disclaimers or limitations of liability is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, or if we are otherwise found to be liable to you in any manner, then our aggregate liability for all claims under such circumstances for any and all liabilities shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the amount paid by you for your use of the Service during the prior twelve (12) months.\nor (b) ten dollars ($10).\n</p>\nIndemnity\n<p>\nWe made these Terms of Use for a reason.\nTherefore, we can\u2019t be held responsible if you disregard them.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Patch, its officers, directors, members, employees, licensors, licensees, business partners and agents, and each of their respective heirs, successors and assigns, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including, but not limited to, attorney's fees) arising from: (a) any breach or alleged breach by you of any of these Terms of Use, (b) Your Content, (c) your use of materials or features available on the Service (except to the extent a claim is based upon

a third party to which you are subject.\n</p>\nAgreement to Arbitrate\n<p> Any dispute, claim or controversy relating in any way to these Terms of Use, your access to or use of the Service, or to any product or service provided by Patch or any advertising for any such product or service, whether with Patch, any affiliate of Patch and/or their respective employees or agents, will be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.\n</p>\n<p> You understand that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, binding arbitration, or an action in small claims court if available, will be the sole and exclusive means of resolving any dispute.\nBy agreeing to arbitrate, both you and Patch give up the right to bring a claim in court (except for small claims court, if available) or in front of a jury, and we each also both give up the right to bring or participate in any class action or other representative action.\nDepending on the circumstances, the costs of arbitration could be greater than the cost of litigation, and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.\nAnd, appeal or court review of an arbitration award is only available in very limited circumstance.\nThe arbitrator will have the power to award only those damages permitted in these Terms of Use, subject to the disclaimers and limitations of liability herein.\nAlthough arbitration procedures may differ from court procedures, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use just as a court would.\nJudgment on any award by the arbitrator may be entered and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n</p>\n<p> To begin an arbitration proceeding, the party seeking arbitration must provide written notice to the other party, requesting arbitration and describing the dispute, the nature of the claim and the relief being sought, at least sixty (60) days before initiating arbitration.\nAny notice to Patch should be sent by mail to Legal Disputes, 134 W.\n29th Street, 11th Floor New York, NY 10001, and\tmust include your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your Patch account, as well as the information described above.\nAny notice to you will be sent to your email address and/or street address, if any, in Patch records at the time the notice is sent.\nIf we are not able to resolve the dispute within sixty (60) days of notice, either party will have the right to seek arbitration as provided below.\n</p>\n<p> The Federal Arbitration Act applies to these Terms of Use.\nAny arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or if you are an individual and use the Service for personal or household use, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (excluding any rules applicable to or permitting class actions) in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced.\nThe AAA's rules and procedures, including the process for beginning an arbitration, are available at www.adr.org.\nIf there is a conflict between the Commercial Arbitration Rules and/or the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, these Terms of Use will control.\nUnless we each agree otherwise, any arbitration proceeding will take place in the county of your primary residence, if you are a resident of the United States, or in the borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, USA.\n</p>\n<p> Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.\nWe will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.\nLikewise, we will not seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\n</p>\n<p> WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.\nIf the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable as to all or part of any dispute, such part(s) will be severed and the remaining part(s) will proceed in arbitration.\nIf for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.\nAnd, notwithstanding the foregoing, we will each have the right to bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\n</p>\n<p> If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the court will reform the agreement to the extent necessary to cure such unenforceability, and the parties will arbitrate the dispute(s) without reference to or relying on the unenforceable part(s).\n</p>\nGoverning Law/Jurisdiction\n<p>\nBecause the Patch HQ is located in New York, we have to play by New York\u2019s rules.\nThat\u2019s why the laws of the State of New York will govern these Terms of Use, without regard to conflict of law provisions.\nIf for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, the courts located in the borough of Manhattan, New York County, New York USA will have exclusive jurisdiction of such dispute, and you and Patch each irrevocably agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose and waive any and all objections to exercise of such jurisdiction by such courts and to venue in such courts.\n</p>\n<p>\nAny claim asserted by you in connection with the Service must be asserted in writing to Patch within one (1) year of the date such claim first arose, or such claim is forever waived by you.\n</p>\nReporting Claims of Copyright Infringement - Digital Millennium

be invalid or unenforceable for any reason by any court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective but shall not affect any other part of these Terms of Use.\nThis
