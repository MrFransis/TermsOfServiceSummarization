as the CC newsletter, campaign updates, or other ongoing email communications from CC), we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on any links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send.\nThis data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.\n&nbsp;As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>\n<p>Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or

information with trusted service providers or business partners in countries other than your country of residence, including the United States, in accordance with applicable law.\nThis means that some

unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.</p>\n10.\n&nbsp;Children\n<p>The Services are intended for users over the age of 18 and are not directed at children under the age of 13.\nIf we become aware that we have collected personal

time.</p>\n12.\n&nbsp;Third-Party Links and Services\n<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., social media sites like Facebook and Twitter), third-party plug-ins (e.g., the

third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function.\nCreative Commons is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such third party websites or services.\nThe collection, use and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy.\nWe
