that Belgium does not have any equivalent to the US NSL (National Security Letter) and gag order, so we cannot be forced to do something without being allowed to disclose it.</li>\n<li>We do not co-operate with the NSA, we do not offer any authority shadow access to our Service.</li>\n<li>We also do not directly disclose any information about our users to law enforcement agencies from outside Belgium and it would be illegal for us to do so.</li>\n<li>Check our transparency report along with an up-to-date warrant canary.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>What information do we collect ? <ol>\n<li>We collect IP addresses, message-ID's, sender and recipient addresses, subjects, browser versions, countries and timestamps.</li>\n<li>When registering, you will be asked to enter an external email address.\nWe send your activation code to this address and use it to communicate with you in case you are unable to access your account.</li>\n<li>Incoming and outgoing messages are automatically analysed by our anti-spam, anti-virus and anti-abuse checking routines.</li>\n<li>We implement a local instance of Matomo, an open source analytics tool, on the commercial website only (home,

? <br>Yes.\nOur cookies are \"authentication cookies\" and not \"tracking cookies\": we do not track you after your session on our servers.\nMore info about cookie types can be found here.</li>\n<li>Do we disclose any information to outside parties ? <br>No.\nWe do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information except when forced by Belgian law (see paragraph about Surveillance and law enforcement).</li>\n<li>Data mining and profiling <br> We do not use Google Analytics trackers.\n&nbsp.\nWe do not sell or give information about our users to any third parties.\nTo make searching fast, we build an index of your messages, calendar, contacts and documents (this is a table, similar to those you might find at the end of a reference book).\nNo information from this or any other activity is used to compile any kind of profile of our users.</li>\n<li>Data retention <br>We retain backups of deleted messages and documents for 45 days.\nThis is for the purpose of restoring data in case of accidental deletion by users.\nAfter 45 days, data will be permanently deleted from all our systems.</li>\n<li>Account deletion <br>Should you close your account, all data will be permanently deleted 30 days after the legal expiration date (i.e.\nthe Belgian law imposes 365 days after account closing).\nThis means that your data will be PERMANENTLY deleted, as opposed to the practice of some major cloud companies which are unable to delete data.\nWe do not delete your account before the legal expiration date because
