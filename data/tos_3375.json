to a country or jurisdiction that cannot guarantee the required level of protection as required by applicable privacy laws, we have enhanced our IT security measures and have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the transferee to require security obligations on the transferee, both of which are intended to increase the protection of your personal data.\nSCCs are one of a number of \"appropriate safeguards\" under the applicable privacy laws that enable the transfer of personal data concerning data subjects within the European Economic Area to jurisdictions that have not been designated by the European Commission as possessing an adequate level of data protection.\nYou may request a copy of such SCCs from us, or inquire about transfers of your information, by providing your request to the contact window set forth in the \"Whom should I contact?\" section.</p> Further processing <p>If we wish to use your personal data for a new purpose not covered by this Notice,

your data using technical measures to minimize the risks of misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized disclosure, loss or theft, and loss of access.\nSome of the safeguards we use are data pseudonymization, data encryption, firewalls, and data access authorization controls.\nWe take our data security very seriously.\nTherefore the security mechanisms used to protect your data are checked and updated regularly to provide effective protection against abuse.</p>\n<p>The servers through which we collect your information are usually encoded using the encryption module of your browser, and are certified by renowned institutions for international encryption technique.\nIf necessary, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your personal information.\nMoreover, we have put in place additional and comprehensive state-of-the-art security measures every time your data are accessed through the internet.\nFirewalls prevent unauthorized access.\nDiverse encryption and identification layers protect your data from intrusion or disclosure to third parties during data transfer.\nFurthermore, we internally use sophisticated encoding methods in order to prevent decoding by unauthorized persons.\nMoreover, an electronic identifier is generated during data transfer to safeguard your information.</p>\n<p>For your confidentiality and security, we use IDs and passwords to secure your personal information.\nIt is important for you to protect your ID, password, or any personal information.\nDo not disclose your personal information, especially your password, to anyone.\nWhen you are finished using our services, please do not forget to log out from your account.\nIf you share a computer, whether in a public or private setting, be sure to sign off and close your browsers when finished using a shared computer.</p>\n<p>If you believe that the security of your data has been compromised, or if you would like more information on the measures we use to protect your data, you can contact us using the channels set forth in the \"Whom should I contact?\" section of this Notice.</p> What are your choices? <p>You have the choice to allow us to collect and

services without the necessary data.</p>\n<p>If you are dealing with us online, note that most browsers will inform you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to receive

the extent that you have consented to our processing of your data, you can choose to discontinue our processing at any time.</p>\n<p>You can choose to add or update data that you have provided us with.</p>\n<p>You can choose to erase your data, or choose to restrict our processing of your data instead.</p>\n<p>You can choose to port your data to a third party under the conditions stated above.</p>\n<p>You can choose to object to our processing of your data.</p>\n<p>You can inform us of your choices or request on any data processing aspect listed above using the channels set forth in the \"Whom should I contact?\" section of this Notice.</p>\n<p>In summary, what we are allowed to do with your data\u2014with limited exceptions under applicable privacy laws\u2014is up to
