<ol>\n<li>Developing a gaming app from scratch is hard.\nThis is why we\u2019ve built a framework that provides creators all the tools they need to build apps that benefit gamers.\nEvery app is independent (desktop icon, dedicated installer etc.), the creator has full ownership and development freedom, and Overwolf makes sure it meets the terms of Game Developers (read more, if you like)</li>\n<li>Overwolf is free and registration is NOT required.</li>\n<li>App developers own, choose, control and manage their creations.\nThey can offer them free of charge, place ads or ask for a monthly subscription.\nIt\u2019s up to them.\nOverwolf makes sure they do it based on our guidelines for quality and user experience.</li>\n<li>Overwolf partners with select service providers to facilitate integrations for app developers (for example, we may partner with Xsoalla or PayPal to facilitate the subscription model for app developers)</li>\n<li>When you install or use an app, you also agree to their Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n</li>\n<li>If you have any feedback or concerns, please let us know.</li>\n</ol>\n<br>\n<p> Overwolf is a tech framework, allowing 3rd party
