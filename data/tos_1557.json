we may inform you of third party research opportunities for which you may be eligible.\nFor example, if a university tells us about a new cancer research project, we may send an email to 23andMe research participants who potentially fit the relevant eligibility criteria to make them aware of the research project and provide a link to participate with the research organization conducting the study.\nWe will not share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party without your explicit consent.\nIf you do not wish to receive these notifications, you can manage them by editing your preferences in your 23andMe Account Settings.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor individuals located in the Designated Countries: Our legal basis for processing your Sensitive Information for the purpose described above is based on your consent.\nYou may withdraw your consent at any time, however, the withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nTo provide customer support\n</strong>\n<p>\nWhen you contact Customer Care, we may use or request Personal Information, including Sensitive Information, as necessary to answer your questions, resolve disputes, and/or investigate and troubleshoot problems or complaints.\nIn some instances, we may be required to process one customer\u2019s Personal Information to resolve another customer\u2019s dispute or request.\nFor example, if a customer reports behavior that violates our Terms of Service, we will separately process both customers\u2019 Personal Information and respond separately to each individual as appropriate.\nWe will not share your Personal Information with another customer without your consent.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor individuals located in the Designated Countries: Our legal basis for processing your Personal Information for the purpose described above depends on the nature of the customer support request.\nOur legal basis can be to satisfy our contractual or legal obligations and/or our legitimate interest to improve our Services.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nTo conduct surveys or polls, and obtain testimonials\n</strong>\n<p>\nWe value your feedback and may send you surveys, polls, or requests for testimonials to improve and optimize our Services.\nYou are in control of the information you would like to share with us.\nIf you do not wish to receive these requests, you can manage them in your 23andMe Account Settings.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor individuals located in the Designated Countries: Our legal basis for processing your Personal Information for the purpose described above is based on our legitimate interest.\nWe think it is important to continue improving our Services to ensure your continued enjoyment.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nTo provide you with marketing communications\n</strong>\n<p>\nBy creating a 23andMe account, you are agreeing that we may send you product and promotional emails or notifications about our Services, and offers on new products, services, promotions or contests.\nYou may also opt-in to receiving similar notifications on the website or mobile application(s).\nYou can unsubscribe from receiving these marketing communications at any time.\nTo unsubscribe, click the email footer \u201cunsubscribe\u201d link or go to the \u201cPreferences\u201d section of your 23andMe Account Settings to edit your email notification preferences.\nTo opt-out of receiving website and mobile notifications, you may do so within your browser or device settings.\nPlease note, the opt-out process differs between web browsers and mobile devices.\nYou may not opt-out of receiving non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as technical notices, purchase confirmations, or Service-related emails.\n</p>\n<p>\nIndividuals located in Designated Countries should review Section 9.d.\nto understand our marketing practices in relation to the Designated Countries.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>\n4.\nInformation we share with third parties\n</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>\nGeneral service providers.\n</strong>\n<p>\nWe share the information described above in Section 2 with our third party service providers, as necessary for them to provide their services to us and help us perform our contract with you.\nService providers are third parties (other companies or individuals) that help us to provide, analyze and improve our Services.\nWhile 23andMe directly conducts the majority of data processing activities required to provide our Services to you, we engage some third party service providers to assist in supporting our Services, including in the following areas:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Order fulfillment and shipping.\u200b</strong> Our payment processor processes certain Registration Information, such as your billing address and credit card information, as necessary to enable you to purchase a 23andMe kit from the 23andMe.com online store.\nOur distribution centers ship your kit(s) to you, and in some cases help return your kit safely to us or to our third party laboratory so your sample can be processed.\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Our CLIA-certified genotyping lab.\u200b</strong> To use our genetic testing services, you must purchase, or receive as a gift, a 23andMe Personal Genetic Service testing kit, and ship your saliva sample to us or our third party laboratory.\nOnce delivered, receiving personnel at the laboratory remove and discard kit packaging, which in some cases may contain \"sender information\" (e.g., name, address), before testing personnel receive the samples for processing.\nReceiving personnel do not perform testing, and testing personnel handle saliva samples that are only identified by a unique barcode.\nFor samples processed by our third party genotyping laboratory, when the laboratory has completed their analysis, they securely send the resulting Genetic Information to us identified by your unique barcode.\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring kit registration, you are asked to review our Consent Document for Sample Storage and Additional Genetic Analyses.\nUnless you consent to Biobanking and additional analyses, your saliva sample and DNA are destroyed after the laboratory completes its work, subject to the legal and regulatory requirements.\nShould you wish to update your sample storage preference to discard a stored sample, you can do so within your 23andMe Account Settings once your sample has completed processing.\nAs detailed further in Section 5.d.\n(Account Deletion), our genotyping laboratory or contracted genotyping laboratory will retain certain information as necessary to comply with applicable regulatory and legal obligations.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer Care support.</strong> Our Customer Care team uses a number of tools to help organize and manage the requests we receive.\nThese tools help to ensure we provide timely, high quality support.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Cloud storage, IT, and Security.</strong> Our cloud storage providers provide secure storage for information in 23andMe databases, ensure that our infrastructure can support continued use of our Services by 23andMe customers, and protect data in the event of a natural disaster or other disruption to our Service.\nOur IT and security service providers assist with intrusion detection and prevention measures to stop any potential attacks against our networks.\nWe have these third party experts perform regular penetration tests and periodically audit 23andMe\u2019s security controls.\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<strong>Marketing and analytics.</strong> When you use our Services, including our website or mobile app(s), our third party service providers may collect Web-Behavior Information about your visit, such as the links you clicked on, the duration of your visit, and the URLs you visited.\nThis information can help us improve site navigability and assess our Marketing campaigns.\nPer applicable data protection regulations, our EU, UK, and International websites present visitors with a cookie opt in to allow the processing described above via Functionality and Advertising Cookies.\n</p>\n<p>\nNOTE: Our service providers act on 23andMe's behalf.\nWe implement procedures and maintain contractual terms with each service provider to protect the confidentiality and security of your information.\nHowever, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality and security of your information due to the inherent risks associated with storing and transmitting data electronically.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\nFor individuals located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), United Kingdom, or Switzerland (collectively the \u201cDesignated Countries\u201d): Where Personal Information are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, 23andMe implements appropriate safeguards, such as contractual obligations, relating to the transfer.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\n\"Targeted advertising\" service providers\n</strong>\n<p>\nWe permit third party advertising networks and providers to collect Web-Behavior Information regarding the use of our Services to help us to deliver targeted online advertisements (\"ads\") to you.\nThey use cookies and similar technologies, to gather information about your browser's or device's visits and usage patterns on our Services and on other websites over time, which helps to better personalize ads to match your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.\nWe and our third party service providers will not use your Sensitive Information, such as&nbsp;Genetic Information&nbsp;and&nbsp;Self-Reported Information, for targeted marketing without asking for and receiving your explicit consent.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor more information about our marketing practices, please review our Cookie Policy.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nAggregate information\n</strong>\n<p>\nWe may share Aggregate Information, which is information that has been stripped of your name and contact information and combined with information of others so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual, with third parties.\nThis Information is different from \"Individual-level\" information and is not Personal Information because it does not identify any particular individual or disclose any particular individual\u2019s data.\nFor example, Aggregate Information may include a statement that \"30% of our female users share a particular genetic trait,\" without providing any data or testing results specific to any individual user.\nIn contrast, Individual-level Genetic Information&nbsp;or Self-Reported Information consists of data about a single individual's genotypes, diseases or other traits/characteristics information and could reveal whether a specific user has a particular genetic trait, or consist of all of the Genetic Information about that user.\n23andMe will ask for your consent to share Individual-level Genetic Information or Self-Reported Information with any third party, other than our service providers as necessary for us to provide the Services to you.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nInformation we share with commonly owned entities\n</strong>\n<p>\nWe may share some or all of your Personal Information with other companies under common ownership or control of 23andMe, which may include our subsidiaries, our corporate parent, or any other subsidiaries owned by our corporate parent in order to provide you better service and improve user experience.\nGenerally, sharing such information is necessary for us to perform on our contract with you.\nWe may provide additional notice and ask for your prior consent if we wish to share your Personal Information with our commonly owned entities in a materially different way than discussed in this Privacy Statement.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nAs required by law\n</strong>\n<p>\nUnder certain circumstances your Personal Information may be subject to processing pursuant to laws, regulations, judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.\nFor example, we may be required to disclose Personal Information in coordination with regulatory authorities in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.\n23andMe will preserve and disclose any and all information to law enforcement agencies or others if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal or regulatory process (such as a judicial proceeding, court order, or government inquiry) or obligations that 23andMe may owe pursuant to ethical and other professional rules, laws, and regulations.\n(b) enforce the 23andMe Terms of Service and other policies.\n(c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties.\nor (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 23andMe, its employees, its users, its clients, and the public.\nView our Transparency Report for more information.\n</p>\n<p>\nNOTE: If you are participating in 23andMe Research, 23andMe will withhold disclosure of your Personal Information involved in such Research in response to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants or orders in accordance with any applicable Certificate of Confidentiality that 23andMe has obtained from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nThere are limits to what the Certificate of Confidentiality covers so please visit the Certificates of Confidentiality Kiosk.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nBusiness transactions\n</strong>\n<p>\nIn the event that 23andMe goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.\nIn such a case, your information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Statement.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>5.\nYour choices</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>\nAccess to your account\n</strong>\n<p>\nWe provide access to your 23andMe data within your 23andMe account.\nYou can access and download data processed by 23andMe within your 23andMe Account Settings and within applicable Reports, Tools, and features.\nIf you lose access to your 23andMe account or account email address, please contact Customer Care for assistance.\nIf you lose access to your 23andMe account, in certain circumstances, we may require that you submit additional information sufficient to verify your identity before providing access or otherwise releasing information to you.\nIf you choose not to submit the required documentation, or the information provided is not sufficient for the purposes sought, 23andMe will not be able to sufficiently verify your identity in order to complete your request.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou may access, correct or update most of your Registration Information on your own within your 23andMe Account Settings.\nYou may also review and update your consent to 23andMe Research and Biobanking.\nYou may be able to correct Self-Reported Information entered into a survey, form, or feature within your account, such as on the surveys page, by clicking \u201cEdit your answers here.\u201d Please note that you may not be able to delete User Content that has been shared with others through the Service and that you may not be able to delete information that has been shared with third parties.\n</p>\n<p>\nIndividuals located in Designated Countries should review Section 9.e.\nto understand their rights to access Personal Information.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nMarketing communications\n</strong>\n<p>\nAs noted in Section 3.h.\nyou may be asked to opt-in to receive product and promotional emails or notifications when creating your 23andMe account or when using our Services.\nYou may view or update your notification preferences for marketing communications by visiting your 23andMe Account Settings, opting out at the browser or device level, or by contacting our Privacy Administrator at privacy@23andMe.com.\nYou can also click the \"unsubscribe\" button at the bottom of promotional email communications, as applicable.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nSharing outside of the 23andMe Services\n</strong>\n<p>\nYou may decide to share your Personal Information with friends and/or family members, doctors or other health care professionals, and/or other individuals outside of our Services, including through third party services such as social networks and third party apps that connect to our website and mobile apps through our application programming interface (\"API\").\nThese third parties may use your Personal Information differently than we do under this Privacy Statement.\nPlease make such choices carefully and review the privacy statements of all other third parties involved in the transaction.\n23andMe does not endorse or sponsor any API applications, and does not affirm the accuracy or validity of any interpretations made by third party API applications.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn general, it can be difficult to contain or retrieve Personal Information once it has been shared or disclosed.\n23andMe will have no responsibility or liability for any consequences that may result because you have released or shared Personal Information with others.\nLikewise, if you are reading this because you have access to the Personal Information of a 23andMe customer through a multi-profile account, we urge you to recognize your responsibility to protect the privacy of each person within that account.\nUsers with multi-profile accounts (i.e., where multiple family members register their kits to one account) should use caution in setting profile-level privacy settings.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>\nAccount deletion\n</strong>\n<p>\nIf you no longer wish to participate in our Services, or no longer wish to have your Personal Information be processed, you may delete your 23andMe account and Personal Information within your 23andMe Account Settings.\nOnce you submit your request, we will send an email to the email address linked to your 23andMe account detailing our account deletion policy and requesting that you confirm your deletion request.\nOnce you confirm your request to delete your account and data, your account will no longer be accessible while we process your request.\nOnce you confirm your request, this process cannot be cancelled, undone, withdrawn, or reversed.\nWhen your account is deleted, all associated Personal Information is deleted and any stored samples are discarded, subject to the following limitations:\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nInformation previously included in 23andMe Research.\nAs stated in any applicable Consent Document, Genetic Information and/or Self-Reported Information that you have previously provided and for which you have given consent to use in 23andMe Research cannot be removed from completed studies that use that information.\nYour data will not be included in studies that start more than 30 days after your account is closed (it may take up to 30 days to withdraw your information after your account is closed).\n</li>\n<li>\nLegal Retention Requirements.\n23andMe and/or our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations, including the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), California Business and Professions Code Section 1265 and College of American Pathologists (CAP) accreditation requirements.\n23andMe will also retain limited information related to your account and data deletion request, including but not limited to, your email address, account deletion request identifier, communications related to inquiries or complaints and legal agreements for a limited period of time as required by law, contractual obligations, and/or as necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims and for audit and compliance purposes.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<strong>6.\nSecurity measures</strong>\n<p>\n23andMe takes seriously the trust you place in us.\n23andMe implements physical, technical, and

Transfers\n</strong>\n<p>\nYour Personal Information will likely be transferred to, stored, and processed in the U.S.\nand other countries outside of where you live.\nWhen we conduct such transfers,

legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest.\nWe will notify you if the restriction is lifted.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Notification of erasure, rectification and restriction.</strong> We will provide notice to each recipient that we disclosed your Personal Information to regarding any

access to the 23andMe public Website and personal\ngenotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample.\n</li>\n<li>\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided using the current\nstate of the art genetic research and technology available at the time of\nproviding the Services.\n</li>\n<li>\nAs research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, 23andMe\nis constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for\nits users.\nYou therefore acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of\nthe Services which 23andMe provides may change from time to time.\n</li>\n<li>\nAs part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that 23andMe\nmay stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features\nwithin the Services) to you or to users generally at 23andMe's sole discretion.\n</li>\n<li>\nYou may stop using the Services at any time.\nYou do not need to

any time, at 23andMe's discretion.\n</li>\n</ul> Important Issues Regarding 23andMe Services <strong>\n</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is permanent.\n</strong> You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide\nto you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive.\nYou should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to\nassess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need\nto obtain further services from 23andMe or from your physician or other health\ncare provider.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.\n</strong> This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to\nalter your life and worldview.\nYou may discover things about yourself that\ntrouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g.,\nyour father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your\nancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average\nchance of developing a specific condition or disease).\nThese outcomes could\nhave social, legal or economic implications.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the\nlaboratory process may result in errors.</strong> The laboratory may not be\nable to process your sample if your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume\nof DNA, you do not provide enough saliva, or the results from processing do\nnot meet our standards for accuracy.\nIf the initial processing fails for any\nof these reasons, 23andMe will reprocess the same sample at no charge to you.&nbsp.\nIf the second attempt to process the same sample fails, 23andMe will offer to\nsend another kit to you to collect a second sample at no charge.\nIf you send another sample and 23andMe's attempts to process the\nsecond sample are unsuccessful, 23andMe will not send additional sample\ncollection kits and you or the person who paid for the Service (if that is\nnot you) will be entitled to a complete refund of the amount paid to 23andMe.\n</li>\n<li>\nIn this event, you will not resubmit another sample through a future purchase\nof the service.\nIf you breach these TOS and resubmit another sample through\na future purchase of the service and processing is not successful, 23andMe\nwill not offer to reprocess the sample or provide you or the person who paid\nfor the Service (if that is not you) a refund.\n</li>\n<li>\nEven for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction\nof the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable\nor incorrect (referred to as \"Errors\").&nbsp.\nAs this possibility is known in advance,\nusers are not entitled to refunds or entitled to make any other claims where\nthese Errors occur.\n</li>\n<li>\nThe above sets out our sole responsibility to you in the event that we are\nunable to process your sample.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of\ninformation from 23andMe.</strong> Make sure to discuss your Genetic\nInformation with a physician or other health care provider before you act\nupon the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe Services.\nFor most common\ndiseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction\nof the risk.\nThere may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle\nchoices that are far more important predictors.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf your data indicates that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a\nparticular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected.\nThe opposite is also true.\nif your data indicates you are at an elevated genetic\nrisk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively\ndevelop the disease or condition.\nIn either case, if you have concerns or\nquestions about what you learn through 23andMe, you should contact your\nphysician or other health care provider.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Genetic research is not comprehensive.</strong> While we measure many\nhundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage\nof them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions.\nThe\nresearch community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important\nmission of 23andMe is to conduct and contribute to this research.\n</li>\n<li>\nPlease note that many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies.\nBecause interpretations provided in the Services rely on these published\nstudies, some interpretations may not apply to you.\n</li>\n<li>\nPlease further note that future scientific research may change the interpretation\nof your DNA and the scientific community may show previous research to be\nincomplete or inaccurate.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your\ninterests.</strong> You should be careful about sharing your Genetic\nInformation with others.\nCurrently, very few businesses or insurance companies\nrequest genetic information, but this could change in the future.\n</li>\n<li>\nYou may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection\nof your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.\n</li>\n<li>\nFurthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician\nor other health care provider may become part of your medical record and\nthrough that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or\ninsurance companies in the future.\n</li>\n<li>\nYou acknowledge that Genetic Information that you share with family, friends\nor employers may be used against your interests.\nEven if you share Genetic\nInformation that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have\ngreater meaning in the future as technology improves and new discoveries are made.\n</li>\n<li>\nYou should be aware that, if you are asked by an insurance company whether\nyou have learned Genetic Information about health conditions and you do not\ndisclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud or a breach of the\npolicy that you subsequently purchase.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>23andMe Services are for research, informational, and educational\nuse only.</strong> We do not provide medical advice.\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The Genetic Information provided by 23andMe is for&nbsp;research,\ninformational, and educational use only.</strong> This means two things.\nFirst, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically\nvalidated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the\nresearch community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing.\nSecond, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical\napplication of genetic knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users\nto participate in 23andWe Research.\nParticipation in such research is voluntary\nand based upon an IRB-approved consent document.\n</li>\n<li>\nAs a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our\nServices are for research, informational, and educational purposes only.\nThe\nServices are not intended to be used by you for any diagnostic purpose and are\nnot a substitute for professional medical advice.\nYou should always seek the\nadvice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you\nmay have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of\nany disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.\n</li>\n<li>\n23andMe does not endorse, promise or guarantee the effectiveness of any\nspecific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care\nproviders, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures,\nopinions or other information that may be mentioned on our Website or available\nthrough our Service.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf we provide to you through our Service any information that identify for you,\nbased on your Genetic and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature\nor research, concerns about your health, this information is intended for\ninformational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other\nhealthcare provider.\n</li>\n<li>\nWe believe that:\n<ul>\n<li>\ngenetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being.\n</li>\n<li>\nthe state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly\nevolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture\nof the role of genetics.\nand\n</li>\n<li>\nonly a trained physician or other health care provider can assess\nyour current state of health or disease, taking into account many\nfactors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current\nsymptoms, if any.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\nYou should not take any decisions about your health or life based on the\ninformation you receive through the Service and, if you do, you do so entirely\nat your own risk.\n</li>\n<li>\nWe are licensed in California as a clinical laboratory and do not require a\nlicense to provide our Services in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark,\nFinland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n</li>\n</ul> Your Promises <strong>\n</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>By accessing 23andMe Services, you agree to, acknowledge, and promise as\nfollows:\n<ul>\n<li>\nYou understand that information you learn from 23andMe is not designed\nto diagnose, prevent, or treat any condition
