(\u201cVIA,\u201d \u201cCorporation,\u201d \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d and \u201cus\u201d) knows that you care how information about you is used and safeguarded.\nWe respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting your privacy through our compliance with this Privacy Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d).\nThis Policy should be read in conjunction with our Terms of Service, into which this Policy is incorporated by reference.</p>\n<p>In compiling this Policy, we have taken steps to ensure we have incorporated the standards and principles outlined in data collection and privacy frameworks, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nThis Policy describes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the website https://www.viacharacter.org/ (the \u201cWebsite\u201d) as well as any websites and blogs directly owned by VIA (\u201cour websites\u201d)</li>\n<li>Our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This Policy does not apply to websites or other domains that are maintained or operated by third parties or our affiliates.\nOur websites may link to third party websites and services, but these links are not endorsements of these sites and this Policy does not extend to them.\nBecause this Policy is not enforced on these third party websites, we encourage you to read any posted privacy policy of the third party website before using the service or site and providing any Personal Information.\nPersonal Information is any information that can be used to individually identify you from a larger group, and can include details such as your name, email address, age, and address.</p>\n<p>Please read this Policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.\nIf you do not agree with our policies and practices, then please do not use our websites.\nBy using our websites, you agree to the terms of this Policy.\nThis Policy may change from time to time (see below, \u201cChanges to this Policy\u201d).\nYour continued use of our websites after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Policy periodically for updates.</p>\n<p>Your responses to questionnaires on the Website are entirely voluntary and will be used, anonymously, in ongoing research by VIA, the creators of the questionnaires, and other researchers with VIA\u2019s permission.\nBy visiting the Website and completing the questionnaires, you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What We Collect and How We Collect It</strong>\n</p>\n<p>To ensure that we provide you with the best possible experience, we will store, use, and share information about you in accordance with this Policy.\nFor example, when you request information, subscribe to our emails, complete a survey, or register yourself with the Website, we will ask you to provide Personal Information to complete these transactions.</p>\n<p>You are not required to give us your real email address or name, but providing your real email address and name will help us assist you with your account.\nIf we receive a request for information about your account, the response will be sent to the registered address, not the one making the request, unless we can verify that the registered address is an invalid or defective address and that the person making the request is the person who created the account.</p>\n<p>Some of the questions presented in our surveys and questionnaires will ask for potentially sensitive information relating to your political opinions, or religious, spiritual, and philosophical beliefs.\nBy answering these questions, you consent to the processing of that personal data for the purpose of providing results about your character strengths.</p>\n<p>You are not required to provide us with any of this data, but if you choose to submit the registration form or any of the questionnaires, you must answer all of the questions to receive your scores.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Automatic Information Collection</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In addition to the information that you provide us through registration, questionnaires, or elsewhere, we may also collect information about you during your visit to our Website or while you engage with one of our marketing campaigns.\nWe collect this information using automated tools that are detailed below.\nThese tools may collect information about your behavior and your computer system: information like your internet address (IP address), the pages you have viewed, the type of browser you used, and the actions you have taken while on our websites.\nThis helps us understand usage of the website and allows us to produce aggregate statistics on usage.</p>\n<p>We may also use these tools in connection with our email marketing campaigns to allow us to understand what links you click on and what content is of interest to you.\nVIA may also collect information from commercial sources to enrich and verify the information that you have provided or that we have collected about you.\nThis information will help us to ensure that we have accurate records, and will provide us with the ability to keep your information up to date.\nIn some cases, we may use this commercial information to determine something about you.\nFor example, we may use your IP address to calculate
