authorization or made available on or through the Crowdin Services by Supplier.\nBy uploading Client Data to the Platform, Client authorizes Supplier to process the Client Data.</p>\n<p>The Client is responsible for ensuring that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Client and any of the Users associated with the Account do not create, transmit, display or make otherwise available any Client Data that violates the terms of these Terms, the rights of Supplier or is harmful (for example viruses, worms, malware and other destructive codes), offensive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another\u2019s privacy, hateful or otherwise unlawful;</li>\n<li>and the Client and all of the Users associated with the Account have the necessary rights to use the Client Data,

of Accuracy.\n<p>Supplier does not guarantee any accuracy with respect to any information contained in any Client Data, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you transmit, submit or post to or through the Crowdin Services.\nYou understand that all information contained in Client Data is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Client Data originated.</p>\n<p>This means that Client, and not Supplier, is entirely responsible for all Client Data that is uploaded, posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Crowdin Services, as well as for any actions taken by the Suppliers or other Clients or Users or third parties as a result of such Client Data.</p>\n<p>Supplier has no obligations to monitor the use of or ensure that the Client Data does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of other Clients, Users or third parties.\nClient or User (as the case may be) is solely responsible for securing all necessary rights to the Client Data.</p> 7.3 Unlawful Client Data.\n<p>Supplier is not obliged to pre-screen, monitor or filter any Client Data or acts of its processing by the Client in order to discover any unlawful nature therein.\nHowever, if such unlawful Client Data or the action of its unlawful processing is discovered or brought to the attention of Supplier or if there is reason to believe that certain Client Data is unlawful, Supplier has the right to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>notify the Client of such unlawful Client Data;</li>\n<li>demand that the Client bring the unlawful Client Data into compliance with these Terms and applicable law;</li>\n<li>temporarily or permanently remove the unlawful Client Data from the Web Site or Account, restrict access to it, suspend it or delete it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If Supplier is presented convincing evidence that the Client Data is not unlawful, Supplier may, at its sole discretion, restore such Client Data, which was removed from the Account or access to which was restricted.\nIn addition, in the event Supplier believes in its sole discretion Client Data violates applicable laws, rules or regulations or these Terms, Supplier may (but has no obligation), to remove such Client Data at any time with or without notice.</p>\n<p>Crowdin O\u00dc as the data processor will assist the Client as the data controller in meeting the Client\u2019s obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providing subject access, and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.</p> 7.4 Compelled Disclosure.\n<p>Supplier may disclose a Client\u2019s confidential information to the extent compelled by law to do so.\nIn such instance, Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client with prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and Client shall provide reasonable assistance, at its cost, if Client wishes to contest the disclosure.\nIf Supplier is compelled by law to disclose Client\u2019s confidential information as part of a civil proceeding to which Supplier is a party, and Client is not contesting the disclosure, Client will reimburse Supplier for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that confidential information.</p> 8.\nSERVICES<i>\n</i> 8.1 Use of the Crowdin Services.\n<p>Subject to these Terms, and the payment of the

the Services in centralized databases and with service providers located in the U.S.\nThe U.S.\nmay not have the same data protection framework as the country from which you may be using the Services.\nWhen we transfer Personal Data to the U.S., we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>The Service is hosted in the United States or Germany.\nRegardless of the database being hosted in the EU, if you choose to use the Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S.\nlaw, then please note that you may be transferring your Client Data and Personal Data outside of those regions to the United States for storage and processing by our service providers listed in the Crowdin Terms of Service.\nWe will comply with GDPR requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information from Europe to the U.S.\nAlso, we may transfer your data to the U.S., the EEA, or other countries or regions deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection of personal data in connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service.</p> 14.\nDATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR<i>\n</i>\n<p>Crowdin does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Client Data stored or processed by a Client or User via the Service.\nOnly the Client or Users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Client Data.\nCrowdin is largely unaware of what Client Data is actually being stored or made available by a Client or User to the Service and does not directly access such Client Data except as authorized by the Client, or as necessary to provide Services to the Client and its Users.</p>\n<p>Because Crowdin does not collect or determine the use of any Personal Data contained in the Client Data and because it does not determine the purposes for which such Personal Data is collected, the means of collecting such Personal Data, or the uses of such Personal Data, Crowdin is not acting in the capacity of data controller in terms of the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, hereinafter \u201cGDPR\u201d) and does not have the associated responsibilities under the GDPR.\nCrowdin should be considered only as a processor on behalf of its Clients and Users as to any Client Data containing Personal Data that is subject to the requirements of the GDPR.\nExcept as provided in this Privacy Policy, Crowdin does not independently cause Client Data containing Personal Data stored in connection with the Services to be transferred or otherwise made available to third parties, except to third party subcontractors who may process such data on behalf of Crowdin in connection with Crowdin\u2019s provision of Services to Clients.\nSuch actions are performed or authorized only by the applicable Client or User.</p>\n<p>The Client or the User is the data controller under the Regulation for any Client Data containing Personal Data, meaning that such party controls the manner such Personal Data is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such Personal Data.</p>\n<p>Crowdin is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in the Client Data or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors\u2019 servers) at the discretion of the Client or User nor is Crowdin responsible for the manner in which the Client or User collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.</p>\n<p>If you need a signed Data Processing Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you can find the document signed on behalf of Crowdin here.</p> 15.\nCHANGES AND UPDATES TO THIS POLICY<i>\n</i>\n<p>Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Policy, which we may update from time to time.\nIf we modify the Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision, and will comply with applicable law.\nYour continued use of the Service after the revised Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Policy.</p> 16.\nHOW TO CONTACT US<i>\n</i>\n<p>Please contact us with any questions or comments about this Policy, your Personal Data, our use and disclosure practices, your consent choices, or if you have any concerns or
