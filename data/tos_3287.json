protecting your privacy.\nThis privacy policy (\"<b>Policy</b>\") applies to NetZero Internet and mobile websites (the \"<b>Sites</b>\") and NetZero services (the \"<b>Services</b>\").\nThe purpose of this Policy is to disclose NetZero's practices related to information we collect from you and have about you.\nPlease read this Policy carefully.\nYou may select any of the links below or simply

applies to the Sites and Services only.\nWhen you visit websites to which we link, or if you click on third party advertisements that appear on our Sites, you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policies.\nFor example, a third party website will have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and web beacons or collection of your information.\nIn addition, you may choose to use services and products offered by third parties through our Services or devices such as third party applications.\nYour use of such services and applications may result in these third parties collecting your personal information and obtaining information from NetZero, including location information (when applicable).\nYou may also choose to give personal information directly to third parties when using such services.\nIn each case, personal information you give a third party will be subject to its terms, conditions, and policies-not this policy.\nYou should review a third party's privacy policy and terms of service before providing your information or using the service.\nWe encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other website or application from which you request products or services.\nYou can access and update most of your basic account information by visiting your account page.\nBecause your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information.\n</p>\n<p>I.\nCollection of Your

know which emails you have opened.\n<br>\n<br>\nNetZero does not currently take action as to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not been developed.\n<br>\n<br>\nPlease

&amp.\nOpt-Outs</p>\n<b>A.\nTargeted Advertising Opt-Outs:</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nWe may display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites based on information we obtain from you, about you, and/or from third parties.\n<br>\n<br> We work with advertisers, agencies, and other companies that connect advertisers to the Internet (collectively, \"<b>Advertisers</b>\") in order to display targeted advertisements to you while you are on and off our Sites.\nThese advertisements are targeted based on information that we or third parties may have collected about you such as demographic information (gender, age, general geographic location, etc.) as well as behavioral information.\nBehavioral information is information about your preferences that is collected or inferred based on, among other things, online data such as the URLs or websites you visit and searches you perform, and offline data such as your purchases and subscriptions.\nInformation shared with Advertisers is pseudonymized prior to transfer.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe and our Advertisers may use technological methods to measure the effectiveness of advertisements and to personalize advertising content.\nfor example, web beacons may enable us or our Advertisers to recognize your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.\nIn addition, a unique third party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser when you visit our Sites or when you open an email.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may opt out of targeted advertising from many Advertisers by exercising your choice

other similar device you are using at the time you opt out.\nYour opt-out choice cannot be honored if you access our Sites using a different browser on this computer, mobile device or other similar

instructions provided by the Advertiser.\nThese solicitations are a condition of receiving the free or discounted Service and you agree that if you opt out of receiving these solicitations you are required to terminate the relevant Service.\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>IV.\nHow We Keep Your Information Secure</p> We use secure socket layer (\"<b>SSL</b>\") technology to protection your information.\nSSL encrypts your order information as additional protection against the decoding of that information by anyone other than us.\nHowever, despite all reasonable security precautions and processes, such as
