the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), entities like CR that act as data controllers \u2013 meaning those entities that determine the purpose and means of processing of personal information -- must have a lawful basis for processing that information.\nIn order to provide Data Subjects with CR Products and otherwise comply with our legal obligations, CR needs to collect and process certain types of personal information from Data Subjects.\nThe lawful bases that we rely upon to process the personal information held about Data Subjects are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To carry out our

agreement between you and CR (see our User Agreement) and/or in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements and tax and accounting rules.\nWe will endeavor not to keep personal information in a form that allows a Data Subject to be identified for any longer than is reasonably necessary for achieving the permitted purposes.\nAt the end of the applicable retention period, we may destroy, erase from our systems, or anonymize personal information as part of such efforts.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the

through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.<br>\n<br> Storage and Transfer of Personal Information <br>\nWe maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect Data Subjects\u2019 personal information, prevent unlawful or unauthorized processing of personal information, and prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or accidental loss of, or damage to, such

in which Data Subjects reside, and which may not have received an adequacy decision from the European Commission.</p>\n<p>Personal information will also be processed by staff who work for us and operate outside the European Economic Area.\nThis includes staff engaged in, among other things, the provision of administration and support services.\nAll such staff are subject to appropriate
