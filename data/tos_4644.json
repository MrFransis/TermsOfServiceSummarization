Information\u201d means information about an identifiable individual (including any \u201cPersonal Information\u201d as such term is defined in the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic

including but not limited to your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers.\nNon-Personal Information also includes \u201cUsage Data\u201d which is anonymous data associated with your computer, mobile device, and/or media system platform, that includes, in-media time, activities, purchases, badges, and in full compliance with HIPAA and Privacy laws, and on an aggregated and anonymous basis, your diary entries, data and notes, recipes, targets and profile.<br>\n<br>Note: Under certain circumstances, Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information may constitute PHI.\nIf HIPAA applies to such Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security rule requirement.\nFor example, if we are a Business Associate of a Covered Entity, and if specific Personal Information and/or Non-Personal Information that we use or disclose as such a Business Associate is PHI, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security rule requirement with respect to any such use and disclosure.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Application of this Privacy

information disclosed to any third party service providers is dealt with in accordance with the privacy policies adopted by each of those service providers.\nIndividuals are encouraged to review the privacy policies maintained by each of those service providers to understand how their information will be used by those entities to process requests.\nFor example, we partner with third party service providers and vendors to provide access to existing payment gateways and your credit card, banking and other billing information is kept with our payment processor Stripe and you can read about their privacy policy at the following link: www.stripe.com.<br>\n<br>The Site and/or Services may contain links to third party websites (the \u201cLinked Sites\u201d) that are not controlled or operated by

Sites and Cronometer is not responsible for any information disclosed to or collected by those Linked Sites or for the privacy practices of any operators or sponsors of the Linked Sites.\nThe fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party.\nBecause we cannot control the activities of third parties, we do not accept responsibility for any use of your information by such third parties, and we do not guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security practices as Cronometer.\nTo determine how your information will be treated when accessing or using the Linked Sites, you must read the privacy policy, if any, that applies to each of the Linked Sites.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Collection of
