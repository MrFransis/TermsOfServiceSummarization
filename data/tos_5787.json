consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or abusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In general, we will verify a request by matching the identifying information supplied by the user with the

whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions.&nbsp.\nThe arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including injunctive relief.&nbsp.\nAny award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.&nbsp.\nIf you initiate arbitration against us and the arbitrator awards

suit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Class Action Waiver.&nbsp.\n</b>The arbitration provision contained in these Terms &amp.\nConditions does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above.&nbsp.\nThis provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exceptions to Mandatory Arbitration.</b>&nbsp.\nThere are two narrow exceptions to mandatory arbitration.&nbsp.\nFirst, you may opt-out of the Arbitration/Dispute Resolution provision by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first register on the Sites.&nbsp.\nTo obtain our mailing address,
