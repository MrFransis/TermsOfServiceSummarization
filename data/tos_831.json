<b>\"Data Subject\"</b> we mean any natural person that shares personal data with us via Website.</p>\n<p>When we say <b>\"processing\"</b> we mean any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or sets of personal data.\nThis includes activities such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>\n<p>When we say <b>\"personal data\"</b> or <b>\"data\"</b> we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.\nan identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, either directly or indirectly.\nTherefore, data about a company or any legal entity is not considered to be personal data but registering on behalf of a legal entity may include sharing personal data.\nFor example, the information in relation to one-person companies may constitute personal data where it allows the identification of a natural person.\nThe rules also apply to all personal data relating to natural persons in the course of professional activity, such as the employees of a company or organization, business e-mail addresses like <b>\"firstname.surname@company.com\"</b>.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information from which no individual can reasonably be identified (anonymized information).</p>\n<p>When we say <b>\"Data Processors\"</b> or <b>\"processor\"</b> we mean any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller.\nIn some cases, COING is a Data Processor and in others, Data Controller (as further explained in Section 2).\nIn addition, we may use the services of various service providers to process your data more effectively.\nIn such cases, they are either our processors or sub-processors.</p>\n<p>When we say <b>\"cookies\"</b> we mean small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device).\nThis information is used to track your use of the Website and to compile statistical reports on website activity.\nFor further information about the use of cookies and how you can manage them, please read our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>When we say <b>\"consent\"</b> we mean your explicit consent on the processing of personal data.\nPersons who are 15 years of age or older may give free consent to the processing of their personal data.</p> 2.\nDATA CONTROLLER OR DATA PROCESSOR <p>In relation to your personal data processed on or via the Website, COING may be either a Data Controller or Data Processor.</p>\n<p>When COING acts in the capacity of a Data Controller, COING determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\nThe purpose of data processing is the reason why we process your personal data.\nThe table in Section 4 of the Privacy Policy presents the purposes and legal basis for data processing.\nIn such cases, COING is responsible for your personal data.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy contains information on processing your data in the capacity of a Data Controller.\nShould you have any inquiries, or you wish to exercise any of the rights of a Data Subject stipulated in Section 10, please contact us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>COING Inc.</li>\n<li>2100 Geng Road, Suite 210</li>\n<li>Palo

User Content.\nThe type of User Content is determined by the person that owns the Workspace and not by us.\nIn that event, COING is a Data Processor and Data Controller is the owner of the Workspace.\nThus, COING does not analyze, disclose or access such date unless a User sends a request for support and, in these cases, the access is limited to enabling the functioning of the Service.\nShould you wish to send an inquiry or exercise any of the Data Subject's rights, please contact the owner of the relevant Workspace via which your personal data has been processed.</p>\n<p>Please also note that we do not collect your personal data if you are End User of Server Clockify.\nIn that case, Client (the company that has Clockify installed on their server) is

(<b>\"DPA\"</b>), with COING as a Data Processor based outside the EEA.\nThe DPA includes the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, as applicable, and reflects the Parties' agreement with respect to the terms governing the processing of personal data under the CLOCKIFY's Terms of Use.\nSigning the DPA will be considered as an amendment to the Agreement (within the meaning of Section 1 of the Terms of Use) and will be considered to form a part of the Agreement.</p>\n<p>If would like to sign a DPA with us, please contact us at support@clockify.me for more

terror, strike, non-trivial cyber attack, failure of a third-party hosting, Internet failure or any other circumstance qualifying as force majeure under the applicable law \u2014 to the extent that

hereunder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Security policy is applicable only to User Content on Cloud Clockify.\nCOING has no control and cannot be held liable for the breach of security of any User\u2019s data

Account.</p>\n<p>Both you and COING agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration or filing any claim against the other Party.</p>\n<p>Failing to resolve dispute as described in previous paragraphs of this Section, any controversy or claims arising out of or relating to this contract, or the breach thereof, shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
