Documentation, Licensed Software, ThreatSTOP Service and results of ThreatSTOP Service comparative performance benchmarks, passwords provided to Customer for ThreatSTOP Service access, Customer Data, information related to past, present or future research, development or business affairs, any proprietary products, materials or methodologies, and any other information that which by its nature is normally and reasonably considered confidential or provides the disclosing party with a competitive advantage.&nbsp.\nConfidential Information other than that described in the preceding sentence, shall be marked as confidential or proprietary or, if disclosed verbally, shall be identified as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure.\nThe receiving party shall protect the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information with the same degree of care that it regularly uses to protect its own Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care.\nThe receiving party shall use the Confidential Information only for the limited purpose of performing its obligations under this Agreement.\nConfidential Information shall not be provided or disclosed to anyone except those employees or contractors of the receiving party with a need to know in connection with the exercise of the receiving party\u2019s rights or obligations under this Agreement who agree to be bound by these terms.&nbsp.\nConfidential Information and any and all authorized copies thereof shall remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be destroyed or returned if requested by the disclosing party.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.2</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement, neither party shall

reference to disclosure from the disclosing party.\n(v) information that the receiving party receives from third parties, provided such information was not obtained by such third parties from the disclosing party on a confidential basis.\nor (vi) information that is produced in compliance with applicable law or a court order, provided the other party is given reasonable notice of such law or order and an opportunity to attempt to preclude or limit such production.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.3</strong>&nbsp;Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to the unique nature of ThreatSTOP\u2019s Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law to compensate ThreatSTOP for the breach of this Section 9 or of Sections&nbsp;2, 3, or 4.\nthat any such breach will allow Customer or third parties to compete unfairly with ThreatSTOP resulting in irreparable harm to ThreatSTOP that would be difficult to measure.\nand, therefore, that upon any such breach or threat thereof, ThreatSTOP shall be entitled to injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief (without the necessity of proving actual damages or of posting a bond), in addition to whatever remedies it may have at law, hereunder, or otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nNO WARRANTIES.</strong>&nbsp;TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND THREATSTOP SERVICE ARE
