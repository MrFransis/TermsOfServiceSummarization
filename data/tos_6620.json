regarded as an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities of The Kraft Heinz Company.\nIf you decide to use any material available on the Site in assessing whether to buy or sell securities of The Kraft Heinz Company, please be aware that the material on the Site reflects past performance and historical information only and that such performance and information is not necessarily an indication of future performance.</p> FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS <p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions.\nThis website may be considered to contain such \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of a company.</p>\n<p>Words or phrases such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expects,\" \"projects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"targets,\" \"goal,\" \"will likely result,\" \"will continue,\" and similar expressions used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify such forward-looking statements.\nThose forward-looking statements are management's present expectations regarding future events and speak only as of their dates.\nAs with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and Kraft Heinz is under no obligation, and expressly disclaims any such obligation, to update or alter any forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, future events or otherwise.</p>\n<p>Kraft Heinz's actual results could differ materially from management's expectations and anticipated results because of changes in such factors.\nSome of the factors that also could cause actual results to differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, sales, earnings and volume growth, competitive conditions, production costs (including energy, transportation and distribution costs), currency valuations, global economic and industry conditions, achieving cost savings programs, success of acquisitions and divestitures, new product and packaging innovations, the impact of e-commerce and e-procurement, supply chain efficiency and cash flow initiatives, and other factors described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p>In addition, Kraft Heinz's overall strategy, including its financial strategy, its growth of operations, the maintenance of its financial ratios and similar matters could be adversely affected by increased interest rates, failure to meet earnings expectations, significant acquisitions or other transactions and changes in Kraft Heinz's strategies and intentions.</p>
