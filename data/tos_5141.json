manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use, you should not become a Publisher.</p>\nThe Site and Third Party Sites\n<p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the Site.\nThe Site may contain links to third parties' sites which are not owned or controlled by the Provider.\nThe Provider has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies (if any), or practices of any third parties' sites.\nYou acknowledge that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the privacy policies (if any) of any third parties' sites you may access

collecting your personal data are to provide and improve the Site and Service and the related features, to administer your subscription and to enable Publishers to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Service.\nBelow are the types and categories of information we collect.</p>\nPersonal Data Collected\n<p>We collect your personal data in the following ways:</p>\nSign-up\n<p>To use the Service you are required to provide the following information, which you recognize and expressly acknowledge are personal data allowing others, including the Provider, to identify you: first and last name,

the Site (\"Log Data\").\nThe Log Data may include information such as your computer Internet Protocol (IP) address, time and date of your requests, your browser type, what software you were using, the web page you were visiting immediately prior to visiting the Site, access times and dates, your location, mobile network information and other statistics.\nWe use this information to monitor and analyze the use of the Site and for the Site's technical administration, to improve the Site's functionalities and Publisher-friendliness, and to better tailor it to the Publishers' needs.</p>\nCookies\n<p>Like most sites, we use cookies and web log files to track the use of the Site.\nA cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer and allows the Provider to recognize you as a Publisher when you return to the Site using the same computer and web browser.\nIf your browser settings do not allow cookies, you may not be able to use the Site.\nLike the information you enter at subscription, cookies and log file data are used to customize your experience on the Site.</p>\n<p>One type of cookie, known as a \"session\" cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Site.\nSession cookie expires after a short time or when you close your web browser.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the Site may use local shared objects, commonly called a \"flash

include a file, called a web beacon, from these ad networks within pages served by the Provider so the ad networks may provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other sites.</p>\n<p>Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network\u2019s servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>\n<p>These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads.\nThe Provider does not provide personal data to any advertiser or any other third parties.</p>\nLog files, IP and Information About Your Computer\n<p>Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave the Site.\nWe also

other companies to place advertisements on the Site.\nThese companies use technology to deliver advertisements you see on the Site directly to your browser.\nIn doing so, they may automatically receive your IP address.\nOther companies that place advertising on the Site may have the ability to use cookies and/or web beacons to collect information, including information about your use of the Site.\nWe do not control the processes that advertisers use to collect the information.\nHowever, IP addresses, cookies and web beacons alone are not considered as personal data and generally cannot

Other Sites\n<p>Our Site contains links to other websites.\nIf you choose to visit an advertiser by clicking on a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to those third parties' websites.\nThe fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.\nWe do not exercise control over third parties' websites.\nThese other
