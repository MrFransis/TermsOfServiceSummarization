collect on Users (including Students and Discussion Owners) when Users create accounts, request support, record videos, share their experiences with us, or otherwise use the Service.\nWe may also share User personal information with vendors, consultants, and other third party service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf and at our direction.\nFor example, we rely on data center operators and communications vendors to operate our Service or send you notifications.\n</p>\n<p>We may also share User personal information for legal, protection, and safety purposes.\nFor example, </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may share information to comply with applicable laws.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may share information to respond to lawful requests and legal processes.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may share information in an emergency, such as protecting the safety of our employees and agents, our Users, or any person.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We may share information to protect the rights and property of Flipgrid, our agents, employees, customers, and others, including by enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with the sale, merger, bankruptcy, sale of assets or reorganization, in whole or in part, of our company.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flipgrid reserves the right to share Users\u2019 personal information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law.\nFlipgrid reserves the right to use or disclose personal information provided to Flipgrid in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements, or if Flipgrid reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect Flipgrid\u2019s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.\nIn exceptionally rare circumstances where national, state, or company security is at issue, Flipgrid reserves the right to share our entire database of visitors and clients with appropriate government authorities.\nIf we are going to share User personal information, we strive to provide the User with advance notice by e-mail unless prohibited by law from doing so.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>4.\nInformation Users Share</b>\n</p>\n<p>Each Group and Topic and the content submitted, will be displayed in the Group or Topic, respectively and will be visible to anyone who joins the Group or Topic as administered and permitted by the Discussion Owner, subject to the Discussion Owner\u2019s ability to deactivate or moderate submissions.\nThe Discussion Owner, and not Flipgrid, sets the Group or Topic privacy settings.\n</p>\n<p>Discussion Owners choose whether Users are permitted to link to external sites.\nExternal sites are governed by their respective privacy policies.\nFlipgrid leverages Youtube.com's and Vimeo.com's enhanced privacy modes to mark links as 'do not track.\nDiscussion Owners may also record Shorts videos and may share the videos with others.\n</p>\n<p>We may publish comments or feedback from a User about Flipgrid only if we obtain that User\u2019s consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>5.\nInformation Choices and Changes</b>\n</p>\n<p>Users may opt out of providing personal information to the Service at any time by uninstalling the application.\nUsers may also opt out of providing personal information by emailing <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b> to have their account removed or by asking their Discussion Owner to remove their content.\nFlipgrid will stop collecting the User\u2019s personal information in these cases, but may still retain the User\u2019s personal information as outlined in the \u201cData Retention\u201d (Section 8) of this Policy (below).\n</p>\n<p>Our communication email regarding events, news and other such topics explain how to opt out of receiving such emails.\nIf a User opts out, we may still send them operational emails that pertain to the User's account and notifications regarding our services.\n</p>\n<p>Users may send requests about their personal information to our contact information in Section 14 below, including to change contact choices, opt out of our sharing with others, and review, update, correct, or delete personal information.\nOnce the User has been authenticated, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor these requests.\nWe may retain an archived copy of User records as required by law.\nSuch opt outs may result in disruption or cancellation of the Service or impairment of certain Service functionality.\n</p>\n<p>Users may also contact the Discussion Owner and request that the video be removed.\nIf the Discussion Owner is not able to remove the video, Users can contact us at <b>support@Flipgrid.com</b> and request that such videos be removed.\nHowever, we will only be able to remove the video if (a) the User provided their email address when posting the video and (b) the User sends the email request to us using that same email address.\nOtherwise, we may not be able to remove a posted video.\nDeletion of a video removes it from the Group or Topic.\n</p>\n<p>Discussion Owners have certain options with respect to the privacy settings of their Groups and Topics.\nFor example, Discussion Owners choose how Users gain access to their Groups and Topic and whether those Groups and Topics are moderated.\nParents and Students should send all requests regarding these privacy settings directly to the Discussion Owner.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.\nCOPPA AND STUDENTS</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>6.1 Notice to Parents and

laws of the state where you reside (or, if a School, where your principal place of business is located) govern all claims, regardless of conflict of laws principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.\nYou and we irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, for all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service that are heard in court (excluding arbitration and small claims court).\nThe United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale

cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, we may replace those terms with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will not change.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.\nBINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</b>\n</p>\n<p>We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and we agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally.\nIf we can\u2019t, you and we agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury.\nInstead, a neutral arbitrator will decide, and the arbitrator\u2019s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA.\nClass action lawsuits, class-wide arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts in a representative capacity aren\u2019t allowed.\nNor is combining individual proceedings without the consent of all parties.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>11.1 Here is what you need to know about arbitration under these Terms:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(a)</b> Disputes Covered\u2014Everything Except IP.\nThe term \"dispute\" is as broad as it can be.\nIt includes any claim or controversy between you and us concerning the Service, the software related to the Service, the Service\u2019s or software\u2019s price, your account, advertising, marketing, communications, your purchase transaction, billing, or these Terms, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except

98052-6399, U.S.A.\nTell us your name, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want.\nA form is available at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=245499.\nWe\u2019ll do the same if we have a dispute with you.\nAfter 60 days, you or we may start an arbitration if the dispute is unresolved.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(c)</b> Small Claims Court Option.\nInstead of mailing a Notice of Dispute, you may sue us in small claims court in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or Borough of Manhattan, New York, U.S.A.\nif you meet the court\u2019s requirements.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(d)</b> Arbitration Procedure.\nThe AAA will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (or if you are an individual and use the Service for personal or household use, or if the value of the dispute is $75,000 or less whether or not you are an individual or how you use the Service, its Consumer Arbitration Rules).\nFor more information, see www.adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.\nIn a dispute involving $25,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead.\nAny in-person hearing will take place in your county of residence (or, if a business, your principal place of business) or in Borough of Manhattan, New York, if your dispute is with Flipgrid.\nYou choose.\nThe arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could.\nThe arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually to satisfy your individual claim.\nUnder AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim.\nBut a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(e)</b> Arbitration Fees and Payments.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(i)</b> Disputes Involving $75,000 or Less.\nWe will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\nIf you reject our last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed, your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator\u2019s decision (called an \"award\"), and the arbitrator awards you more than this last written offer, we will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000.\n(ii) pay your reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, if any.\nand (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(ii)</b> Disputes Involving More than $75,000.\nThe AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA\u2019s and arbitrator\u2019s fees and expenses.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(f)</b> Conflict with AAA Rules.\nThese Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the AAA\u2019s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(g)</b> Must File Within One Year.\nYou and we must file in small claims court or arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes\u2014see section 11.1 (a), above) within one year from when it first could be filed.\nOtherwise, it\u2019s permanently barred.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(h)</b> Rejecting Future Arbitration Changes.\nYou may reject any change we make to section 10 (except address changes) by sending us notice within 30 days of the change by U.S.\nMail to the address in section 11.1(b).\nIf you do, the most recent version of section 11 before the change you rejected will apply.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>(i)</b> Severability.\nIf the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts won\u2019t be arbitrated but will proceed in court, with the rest proceeding in arbitration.\nIf any other provision of section 11 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed but the rest of section 11 still applies.\n</p> ", "created_at": "2020-11-08 07:50:05.426011", "updated_at": "2020-11-08 07:50:06.819189"}], "points": [{"id": 25189, "title": "The service
