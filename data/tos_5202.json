our services, we obtain contractual commitments from those third parties to protect your personal information.\nSome of these assurances are well-recognised certification schemes like the EU US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States and/or the use of EU approached Standard Contractual Clauses (<strong>\"EU Model Clauses\"</strong>) for controller to controller and /or controller to processor transfers from the EU/UK to jurisdictions, such as Australia who do not have an adequacy finding from the EU

and a critical consideration for Fastmail in the provision of its services to you.\nPlease see further information on the security measures we engage on our websites and platform and when you use any of our services.</p>\n<p>We work hard to protect you and Fastmail from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold.\nMeasures we take include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>placing confidentiality requirements and restricted access protocols on our staff members and service providers who need access to your information in order to process it to

accounting requirements.\nWhere we log information related to\nyour IP address, we retain this information for approximately 90 days.\nThis is for the purposes of fraud watch, as often users don't check in with us in a timely fashion over whether their account is compromised.\nBeing able to look at some amount of recent history and know what activity was taken by a legitimate user vs a malicious one is useful.</p>\n<p>We proscribe your primary email address, if it's at one of our domains, for up\nto 6 six months after your account is closed, to reduce the risk of\nimpersonation, should someone try to use the same email address as you in order\nto impersonate you.</p>\n<p>Where you request that we delete your account from our system, we will\nimmediately lock the account and archive the information, then delete it from\nour severs within approximately 7 days from the date of your request.\nThis\narchive window allows you to recover your information in the event of an\naccident or malicious deletion request.</p>\n<p>However, in specific limited circumstances we may store your personal\ninformation for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of\nyour dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we\nreasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal\ninformation or dealings.</p>
