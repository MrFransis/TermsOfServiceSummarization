have\nfinal responsibility for ensuring your own compliance.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example: ActBlue will not permit users to make donations larger\nthan $2,800 to any federal candidate.\nHowever, ActBlue does not track\nusers' contributions through other avenues (e.g.\nfundraisers,\ncandidates' websites).\nTherefore you (and not ActBlue) are\nresponsible for ensuring that your total contributions through these\ndifferent avenues do not exceed your contribution limits.\nIf you are in a position to make these kinds of large contributions,\nplease be careful and don't give these campaigns' accountants any more\nheadaches than they already have.\n</p> Other Laws\n<p>\nDonations to charities (501(c)(3) organizations) and social welfare groups (501(c)(4) organizations) are not subject to any contributions limits.\nYou may make unlimited donations to these groups on the site.\nActBlue cannot be responsible for your treatment of these donations on your tax returns.\nCharitable donations are tax-deductible for federal income tax purposes.\nSocial welfare donations are not tax deductible as charitable contributions.\nWe will do our best to provide you with all relevant information regarding tax treatment of donations to the entities on our site, such as what percentage of your donation might be used for lobbying activities (check your receipt).\nHowever, it is your responsibility to report your donations accurately as required and to pay your taxes.\nWe recommend consulting your tax adviser or tax preparer if you have any questions.\n</p> Permissions and Reuse

refunds.\nWe do our best to honor refunds requested for reasons such as input error, when a contributor accidentally donates twice or enters the wrong donation amount.\nActBlue will not consider refunds for other reasons such as a change in political or personal opinion or the cancellation of an event.\nActBlue reserves the right to refuse a refund request for these or other reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll refund requests are subject to the availability of the contribution funds.\nBecause ActBlue forwards contributions to the candidate, cause, or committee to whom you choose to contribute, ActBlue will only refund a contribution if we still have the funds or can recover the funds from the recipient.\nFor this reason, it is of the utmost importance that you make your request for a refund as soon after contributing as possible.\n</p>\n<p> All refunds issued by ActBlue will be credited back to the card used to make the contribution.\nIn all cases where we are not able to

software constantly monitors the site for fraudulent activity using stolen cards.\nWhen our software identifies a fraudulent transaction, the contribution will be refunded automatically regardless of whether a refund has been requested.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are with a campaign, committee, or organization that has received a contribution through ActBlue and would like to request that we refund that contribution, please contact us at info@actblue.com or leave us a message at (617) 517-7600 and we will do our best to assist you.\n</p> Cancellation policy\n<p>\nFor your convenience, ActBlue offers the ability to make a recurring contribution to one or more recipients using a stored payment method.\nWhen you sign up for a recurring contribution, ActBlue will charge the amount you designated to your stored account once each month and forward that contribution to the recipient you have chosen.\nAll payment information is stored securely in our system, and we will never change the amount, frequency, or recipient of your recurring contribution.\nIf you wish to cancel future instances of a recurring contribution, or change the payment method used for future charges, you can do so by clicking on the appropriate link in your original receipt, by looking up your contribution on the ActBlue website, or by sending us an email with your request.\n</p> Re-designation of Contributions <p>In the event that a campaign or committee (a) fails for 60 days\nto cash a check from ActBlue which includes your contribution (after\nActBlue makes repeated attempts to work with the campaign to ensure\nall checks are cashed), or (b) affirmatively refuses a contribution\nearmarked through ActBlue, your contribution will be re-designated as\na contribution to ActBlue.\nContributions to social welfare organizations which are similarly not cashed or affirmatively refused will be kept by ActBlue and used generally to support its social welfare activities.\nContributions to charitable organizations which are not cashed or affirmatively refused will go to ActBlue Charities.</p>\nDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n<p> THIS SITE IS PROVIDED BY ACTBLUE ON AN \"AS
