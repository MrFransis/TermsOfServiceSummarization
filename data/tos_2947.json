limitation) www.skillshare.com (the \u201cSite\u201d) and other all websites, mobile applications and other interactive properties through which the service is delivered (collectively, the \u201cServices\u201d) are owned, operated and distributed by Skillshare, Inc., a Delaware corporation (referred to in this Privacy Policy as \u201cSkillshare\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d and through similar words such as \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d etc.).\nBy accessing any part of the Services, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions described below (this \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) and the terms and conditions of our terms of service (the \u201cTerms of Service\u201d).\nIf you do not agree to any of these terms, you should not use the Services.\nThis Privacy Policy applies to all users, including both users who are simply viewing content available via the Services and users who have registered as members of Skillshare.</p>\n<p>We may, at our sole discretion, modify this Privacy Policy at any time.\nUse of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.\nIf we make material changes in the way we collect or use information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Services or sending you an email.\nBy accessing the Services at any time after such modifications, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated policy.\nThis Privacy Policy was last modified as of April 25, 2019.</p>General<p>Your privacy is very important to us.\nAccordingly, we have developed this Privacy Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of Personal Data (as defined below).\nThe following outlines our privacy policy.</p>EU Personal Data<p>If you are located in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined in the EU Privacy Notice below.</p>U.S.\nSchool-based Users<p>If you are a high school student and are accessing the Services through an account provided by your school (a \u201cU.S.\nSchool-based User\u201d), you may only access the Services if you are at least 13 years old.</p>Personal Data<p>When your register with us and become a Skillshare Member, when you choose to teach or attend a class, we will ask you for Personal Data.\n\u201cPersonal Data\u201d refers to information about you that can be used to contact or individually identify you.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information.\nTransactions on Skillshare involving your billing and payment information are processed by PayPal and Stripe and are subject to their privacy policies.\nWe do not store any of the credit card or banking information that you provide to these payment processors.</p>\n<p>In order to send you email from Skillshare, we need your email address.\nTo provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, general location, and telephone number.\nWe may give some or all of this information to the teachers for classes that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes.\nWe will not give your name, email, or other Personal Data to unaffiliated third parties except with your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy.\nThough we employ industry standard measures to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personal Data when required by law or when we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process that we receive or to protect our interests or the safety of others.\nIn addition, we may provide Personal Data to employees, consultants or other business or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf.\nIn such circumstances, we require that these parties agree to protect the confidentiality of such information and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.\nWe may use your Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.</p>Voluntary Disclosure<p>Any Personal Data or content that you voluntarily disclose in public areas becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by other users for any reason.\nYour profile pages (\u201cProfile\u201d) and any online classrooms you participate in are typically publicly available.\nYou have the ability to change your account settings to limit access to your profile, and may delete content you post to public classrooms.\nIf you need assistance with controlling your account privacy settings or with deleting content, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.\nRemoval of posted content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information (e.g., some content may be \u201cinvisible\u201d to other users but remain on our servers in some form).\nYou should exercise caution before disclosing your Personal Data via these or any other public venues.</p>\n<p>For example, if you choose to sign up for a Skillshare account, you may have a Profile on the site, containing your full name and some basic information including your location and bio.\nYou may also add additional optional information to your Profile.\nYou may control what type of Profile information is shown to others through your Account Settings.\nAny information you choose to provide as part of your Profile should reflect how much you want other Skillshare users to know about you.\nWe recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages.\nYou can review and revise your profile information at any time.</p>Children\u2019s Privacy<p>As noted in our Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16, unless you are a U.S.\nSchool-based User (as defined above).\nIf you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Data about yourself to us unless you are a U.S.\nSchool-based User.\nIf we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16 who is not a U.S.\nSchool-based User, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\nIf you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal Data, please contact us at help@skillshare.com.</p>Information About Cookies<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Services, and to analyze traffic patterns on the Services.\nThe Services also use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, and JavaScript (collectively, \u201cCookies\u201d) to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Site and Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services.\nFor example, we use Cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit, and to track whether emails we send you have been viewed.\nCookies are small files \u2013 usually consisting of letters and numbers \u2013 placed on your computer, tablet, phone, or similar device when you use that device to visit our Site.\nWe sometimes combine information collected through Cookies that is not Personal Data with Personal Data that we have about you, for example, to tell us who you are or whether you have an account with us.\nWe may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties.</p>\n<p>Cookies can either be \u201csession Cookies\u201d or \u201cpersistent Cookies\u201d.\nSession Cookies are temporary Cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our Site or using our Services, whereas \u201cpersistent Cookies\u201d are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our Site or Services.\nThe length of time a persistent Cookie stays on your device varies from Cookie to Cookie.\nWe use persistent Cookies to store your preferences so that they are available for the next visit, and to keep a more accurate account of how often you visit our Services, how often you return, how your use of the Services may vary over time.\nWe also use persistent Cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising efforts.\nThrough these Cookies, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.\nYour browser may offer you a \u201cDo Not Track\u201d or \u201cDNT\u201d option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites, and web applications, and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.\nBecause we collect browsing and persistent identifier data, the Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we may collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our properties.</p>\n<p>Some Cookies are placed by a third party on your device and may provide information to us and third parties about your browsing habits (such as your visits to our Site or Services, the pages you have visited and the links and advertisements you have clicked).\nThese Cookies can be used to determine whether certain third party services are being used, to identify your interests, to retarget advertisements to you and to serve advertisements to you that we or others believe are relevant to you.\nWe do not control third party Cookies.</p>\n<p>We use the following types of Cookies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Essential Cookies.\nEssential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested.\nFor example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or Services.\nDisabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.</li>\n<li>Functionality Cookies.\nFunctional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services.\nThese Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</li>\n<li>Performance/Analytical Cookies.\nPerformance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Site and Services such as by collecting information about the daily number of visitors to the Services, the daily requests we receive for particular files on the Services, and what geographical areas those requests come from.\nThese aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others.\nPerformance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services\u2019 content for those who engage with our advertising.\nFor example, Google, Inc.\n(\u201cGoogle\u201d) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services.\nGoogle\u2019s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.\nYou have the option to opt out of Google's use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/.</li>\n<li>Retargeting/Advertising Cookies.\nRetargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.\nFor more information about this, please see the section below titled \u201cThird Party Advertising\u201d.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies.\nOne way you can do this is through your internet browser\u2019s settings.\nMost browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways.\nYou can also delete all Cookies that are already on your computer.\nIf you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some Services and functionalities may not work.</p>\n<p>To explore what Cookie setting are available to you, look in the \u201cpreferences\u201d or \u201coptions\u201d section of your browser\u2019s menu.\nTo find our more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/online/cookies/ or http://www.allaboutcookies.org/.</p>Third Party Advertising<p>We use third party providers, including Facebook and Google AdWords, to advertise the Services across the internet.\nThese providers may use cookies, web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from the Services and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and display targeted ads to you.\n<strong>We only work with providers who undertake not to provide advertising to persons under 18 years of age.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>A cookie is used to indicate to other websites that you visited a particular page, and allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and only display ads that are relevant to you.\n<strong>This cookie does not in any way give access to your computer or mobile device.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If you do not wish to see ads from us, you can opt out in several ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Opt out of Google\u2019s use of cookies by visiting Google\u2019s Ads Settings.</li>\n<li>Opt out of a third-party vendor\u2019s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We may display interest-based ads to you when you are using Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool.\nThis tool allows us to personalize our ads based on your usage of the Services.\nWe do not share any of your personal information with Facebook.\nThe tool lets us convert your email address to a unique number that Facebook uses to match to unique numbers Facebook generates from email addresses of its users.\nYou can find information on how to opt out of this advertising here.</p>Other Sites<p>The Services may contain links to other websites or services.\nWe are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites or services, and you should review the privacy policy of each such website or service to make sure that you are comfortable with it before providing any Personal Data.\nFor example, all teacher payments for classes are processed through third party payment processors.\nAs discussed above, we do not receive any of the credit card information you provide to our third party payment processors, and all such information is subject to their privacy policies.</p>Teachers<p>As discussed above, we may give your Personal Data to the teachers for classes (\u201cTeachers\u201d) that you sign up for so that they can coordinate their classes.\nAs part of our Terms of Use, Skillshare Teachers agree not to abuse other users' Personal Data.\nAbuse is defined as using Personal Data for any purpose other than those explicitly specified in the Teachers' Class.\nHowever, please understand that Skillshare Teachers are not our employees or consultants and that we are not party to any transaction between you and the Teacher.\nAs a result, we cannot control their actions and cannot be held liable for any actions that they may take.</p>Business Transfers<p>In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from users, including without limitation Personal Data, as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.\nIn the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your Personal Data is treated, transferred, or used.</p>Transfers to the United States<p>The Services are hosted in the United States.\nIf you are accessing the Services from the European Union, please see the section titled \u201cTransfers of Personal Data\u201d in the EU Privacy Notice below.\nIf you are accessing the Services from any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Services, which is governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your Personal Data to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>California Privacy Rights<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Services who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.\nTo make such a request, please send an email with \u2018California Privacy Rights\u2019 in the heading to help@skillshare.com or write us at the address listed below.</p>EU Privacy Notice<p>If you are located in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.</p>\n<p>For this EU Privacy Notice section, we use the terms \u201cPersonal Data\u201d and \u201cprocessing\u201d as they are defined in the GDPR, but, in addition to the information identified in the Privacy Policy as Personal Data above, \u201cPersonal Data\u201d generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and \u201cprocessing\u201d generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.\nSkillshare will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.</p>\n<p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.\nIf you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at
