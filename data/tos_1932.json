U.S.\nFederal Agency Users: The Services were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations and their agency supplements.</p>\n<li>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</li>\n<p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk.\nWe aren\u2019t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.\nWe cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.\nWe can\u2019t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>\n<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so.</p>\n<p>The Services may contain links, information or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Kaggle.\nWhen you access third party websites or engage with third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Kaggle is not responsible for such risks.\nWe encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p>\n<p>Kaggle has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services.\nIn addition, Kaggle will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service.\nBy using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p>\n<p>Your interactions with organizations or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations or individuals.\nYou should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties.\nYou agree that Kaggle will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>\n<p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that Kaggle is under no obligation to become involved.\nIf you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Kaggle, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes or our Services.\nIf you are a California resident, you are expressly waiving California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.\"</p>\n<li>What are the rules for competitions on Kaggle?</li>\n<p>Subject to these Terms and any contract with Kaggle, a user may post (\u201cHost User\u201d) a skills-based competition or challenge on the Services (\u201cCompetition\u201d) for other users to participate in such Competition (\u201cParticipant User\u201d).\nCompetitions are subject to separate Competition Rules (defined below) that are established by the Host User.\nCompetitions, except as related to Simulations, exclude games of chance.\nYou may not use or attempt to use the Service to host any such game of chance.\nCompetitions are open to residents of the United States and worldwide, except if you are a resident of Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, or any other place prohibited by law you may not enter any Competition.\nCertain Competitions may also have further geographic or age restrictions and be open only to residents of certain countries.\n</p>\n<p>If you would like to host a Competition on Kaggle, go to https://www.kaggle.com/host.\nCompetitions are run according to rules that describe participation guidelines, the data set(s) to be used by the Participant Users, the criteria used by the Host User to select a winner of the Competition (the \u201cMetric\u201d), the prize awarded to such winner, and when such prize will be awarded.\nSuch rules and selection criteria must comply with all applicable laws and these Terms (collectively, \u201cCompetition Rules\u201d).\nSuch Competition Rules will also include how and when a Participant User must submit Competition Entries (defined below) and the rights the Host User will be granted in such Competition Entry upon selecting such Competition Entry as the winner (\u201cWinning Entry\u201d).\nThe Host User will be granted rights in the Competition Entry only if the winner accepts payment of the prize.\nCertain rights granted in the Competition Entries and Winning Entries are described in Section 9 (Do I have to grant any licenses to Kaggle or to other users?) below.\nThe Competition Rules may impose additional restrictions or requirements for Competitions.</p>\n<p>The Host User must conspicuously display the Metric within the Competition Rules.\nThe Host User must select an objective Metric and must apply that Metric impartially to each Team\u2019s (defined below) selected entries.\nIn selecting a winner, the Host User must apply the Metric and select the Participant Users with the best rankings based on the Metric.</p>\n<p>The Host User and each Participant User will comply with all Competition Rules.\nThe Host User (including any user from Host User\u2019s organization) may not compete in its hosted Competition nor cancel a Competition without first contacting us and receiving our consent to such cancellation.\nAny participation by a Host User (or any user from Host User\u2019s organization) in its hosted Competitions is done so on an ineligible basis (e.g.\nthey cannot receive a prize) and will not otherwise affect the selection of the Winning Entry.</p>\n<p>Subject to the Competition Rules, Participant Users may collaborate as a team as long as each such Participant User confirms its team membership through the Service and does not participate on more than one team for a specific Competition (\u201cTeam\u201d).\nTo be clear, you may not participate on more than one team per Competition.\nSubject to the Competition Rules, Teams may, however, merge with other Teams, but the merged Team will be responsible for all past entries by the component Teams.\nIf your Team wins a Competition, the prize for winning will be distributed equally amongst the members of the winning Team, unless we receive identical requests for unequal prize splits from every member of the Team.</p>\n<p>You may be a Host User or a Participant User for a specific Competition (but not both!).\nA Competition creates a direct relationship between a Host User and a Participant User, and Kaggle will have no liability for any actions or content of a Host User or a Participant User.\nKaggle may provide a Host User with a template for the Competition Rules, but such template is provided without any warranty whatsoever and the Host User is solely responsible for its Competition Rules.\nIt is the sole responsibility of the Host User to ensure that the Competition Rules comply with applicable law.</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that Kaggle may, without any liability but without any obligation to do so, remove or disqualify a Participant User, a Host User or a Competition if Kaggle believes that such Participant User, Competition or Host User are in violation these Terms or otherwise pose a risk to Kaggle, the Service or another user of the Service.</p>\n<p>Regardless of anything to the contrary, Participant Users acknowledge and agree that Kaggle and Host Users have no obligation to hold a Competition Entry in confidence or otherwise restrict their activities based on receipt of such Competition Entry.\nKaggle has no obligation to become involved in disputes between users (for example, between a Participant User and a Host User) or between users and any third party relating the use of the Services.\nExcept for Kaggle hosted Competitions, Kaggle does not oversee Competitions (including the selection of Winning Entries) and does not endorse any content users submit to the Services.\nWhen you host or participate in a Competition, you release Kaggle from claims, damages, and demands of every kind \u2014 known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed \u2014 arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and the Services.\nAll content you access or submit via the Services is at your own risk.\nYou are solely responsible for any resulting damage or loss to any party.</p>\n<li>What are Environments?</li>\n<p>Users may upload agents to the Services.\nAn \u201cEnvironment\u201d will accept the agent\u2019s actions and generate a new state.\nAn episode is an Environment running one or more agents until done.\nThe agent\u2019s activity in an episode may be available for viewing and download.</p>\n<p>Each Environment may be subject to additional rules, for example, describing how many agents are needed to participate in an episode, how an agent\u2019s performance is better or worse, and the final outcome needed for an episode to be done.\nEach episode may be part of a larger grouping of multiple episodes, for example as part of a Competition, but an Environment by itself is not a Competition.\nKaggle will use a predetermined ranking and matching algorithm to determine the order and frequency at which a user\u2019s agent participates in an episode, as well as the number of ranking points associated with the result of that episode.\nThe rules for the Environment and Competition will be made accessible to the user.</p>\n<li>Do I have to grant any licenses to Kaggle or to other users?</li>\n<p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your \u201cUser Submission.\u201d Some User Submissions are viewable or downloadable by other users.\nTo display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.\nPlease note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personal information.</p>\n<p>For all User Submissions, you grant Kaggle a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on a mobile device as well as a computer), distribute and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Kaggle, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of communication networks, devices, services, or media, and the licenses you grant under these Terms include the rights to do so.\nYou also agree that all of the licenses you grant under these Terms are royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and worldwide.\nThese are licenses only \u2014 your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p>\n<p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal Kaggle account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a \u201cPersonal User Submission\u201d), you grant Kaggle the license stated in the second paragraph of this Section 9, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.\nIf you share a User Submission in a manner that only allows certain specified users to view it (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a \u201cLimited Audience User Submission\u201d), then you grant Kaggle the license stated in the second paragraph of this Section 9, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so.\nAlso, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>\n<p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services or in a manner that allows more than just you or certain specified users to view it (such as a Dataset), or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, or feature requests relating to the Services (each a \u201cPublic User Submission\u201d), then you grant Kaggle the license stated in the second paragraph of this Section 9, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Kaggle users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services for any purpose.\nAlso, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p>\n<p>If you are a Participant User and submit an entry to a Competition (\u201cCompetition Entry\u201d), then you grant Kaggle the license stated in the second paragraph of this Section 9, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Competition Entry for the purpose of making that Competition Entry accessible to the Host User, making that Competition Entry available to other Kaggle users as a Dataset, and providing the Services necessary to do so.\nAlso, you grant such Host User a limited license to access and use the Competition Entry solely for the purposes of evaluating the Competition Entry under the Competition Rules and as otherwise stated in the Competition Rules.\nIf you win a Competition, your Competition Entry for such Competition will be subject to further licensing as stated in the Competition Rules, but other than the limited licenses stated in these Terms, the intellectual property rights in your Competition Entries will not be transferred or licensed to the Competition Sponsor or Host User unless you accept the payment of the applicable prize stated in the applicable Competition Rules.</p>\n<p>If you and Kaggle agree (separate from these Terms) that Kaggle will assist you in setting up and managing your Competition, then in addition to the licenses stated above you also grant Kaggle a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and worldwide license to set up and manage your Competition, including your User Submissions for the Competition.\nKaggle will have no liability regarding the applicable Competition, Content or User Submissions and these Terms will apply, except if you and Kaggle have executed a separate written agreement governing competitions or services (\"Existing Agreement\"), in which case the Existing Agreement will govern the Competition.</p>\n<li>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</li>\n<p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \u201cDMCA\u201d), as it relates to online service providers, like Kaggle, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone\u2019s copyright.\nWe respect others\u2019 intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers.\nTo review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, click here.\nTo learn more about the DMCA, click here.</p>\n<li>Will Kaggle ever change the Services?</li>\n<p>We\u2019re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time.\nWe may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services.\nWe\u2019ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn\u2019t always practical.</p>\n<li>Does Kaggle cost anything?</li>\n<p>The Kaggle Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services.\nIf you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p>\n<p>Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the \u201cPaid Services\u201d).\nPlease see our Paid Services page for a description of the current Paid Services.\nPlease note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial.\nYou must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period to avoid being charged for that Paid Service.\nIf you cancel before the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us through Kaggle Support.</p>\n<li>What if I want to stop using Kaggle?</li>\n<p>If you do not have any active Competitions that you are hosting, then you\u2019re free to stop using the Service at any time.\nplease refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.\nIf you are hosting active Competitions then you should complete the Competitions, in full, before you stop using the Services.</p>\n<p>Kaggle is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.\nKaggle has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions in these Terms.</p>\n<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>\n<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms will survive termination.\nBy way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p>\n<li>What else do I need to know?</li>\n<p>Warranty Disclaimer.\nNeither Kaggle nor its licensors or suppliers makes any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services (including Competitions), and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.\nWe (and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Services.\nProducts and services purchased or offered (whether or not following such recommendations and suggestions) through the Services are provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and without any warranty of any kind from Kaggle or others (unless, with respect to such others only, provided expressly and unambiguously in writing by a designated third party for a specific product).\nTHE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY KAGGLE (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN

THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>Limitation of Liability.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING TORT, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) WILL KAGGLE (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO KAGGLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (C) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\n<p>Indemnity.\nTo the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you will defend, indemnify and hold Kaggle, its affiliates, officers,

any way related to any third party claims (including from other users) relating to (a) your submissions to the Services including any Content, User Submissions or Competitions, (b) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (c) your violation of these Terms.</p>\n<p>Assignment.\nYou may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Kaggle\u2019s prior written consent.\nWe may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>\n<li>About These Terms</li>\n<p>These Terms control the relationship between Kaggle and you.\nThey do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>\n<p>If you do not comply with these Terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, this doesn\u2019t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>\n<p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other part of the Terms.</p>\n<p>The laws of California, USA, excluding California\u2019s conflict

described below, you can view and manage cookies in your browser (though browsers for mobile devices may not offer this visibility).</p>\n<p>Category of Use</p>\n<p>Example</p>\n<p>Security</p>\n<p>We use security cookies to authenticate users, prevent fraudulent use of login credentials, and protect user data from unauthorized parties.</p>\n<p>For example, we use cookies called \u201c.ASPXAUTH\u201d, which contains encrypted records of a user's Kaggle account ID, and \u201cCSRF-TOKEN\u201d, which contains an identifier.\nWe use these cookies to authenticate users and prevent forgery.</p>\n<p>Processes</p>\n<p>Process cookies help make the website work and deliver services that the website visitor expects, like navigating around web pages or accessing secure areas of the website.\nWithout these cookies, the website cannot function properly.</p>\n<p>For example, we use a cookie called \u201cGCLB\u201d which makes it possible for us to improve your experience when navigating the Kaggle website.\nBlocking this cookie would prevent kaggle.com from operating correctly.</p>\n<p>Session State</p>\n<p>Websites often collect information about how users interact with a website.\nThis may include the pages users visit most often and whether users get error messages from certain pages.\nWe use these so-called \u201csession state cookies\u201d to help us improve our services, in order to improve our users\u2019 browsing experience.\nBlocking or deleting these cookies will not render the website unusable.</p>\n<p>Most Kaggle users will have a Session State cookie called \u201cTempData\u201d in their browsers.\nA browser sends this cookie with requests to kaggle.com.\nThe TempData cookie holds information about messages to display to the user, whether javascript is enabled in the browser and if the user has the most up to date cookies from our site.</p>\n<p>Analytics</p>\n<p>Kaggle uses Google Analytics, an analytics tool that helps website and app

host the Services offered under that contract (see the Terms of Use for additional information).\nIf you do not provide the minimum amount of personal data required to register an account, including your name and email address, you cannot use the Services, as this information is necessary for contractual reasons.\nPlease see \u201cEuropean Requirements\u201d below for further information on the

persistent cookies.\nA session cookie disappears after you close your browser.\nA persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Services.\n</p>\n<p>Persistent cookies can be removed.\nPlease review your web browser\u2019s \u201cHelp\u201d file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.\nIf you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Services, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Services to their fullest potential.</p>\n<p>We may also implement on the Services third party content, such as advertising or analytic services, that uses \u201cclear gifs,\u201d \u201cweb beacons,\u201d or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read and write cookies to your browser or implement similar tracking mechanisms.\nThis information is collected directly by the third party, and Kaggle does not participate in that data transmission.\nInformation collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party\u2019s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.\nWe currently implement services provided by Google Analytics and Facebook.</p>\n<p>Linked accounts</p>\n<p>When you link an account you may have on a third party service (such as a third party social networking site or email provider) to your Kaggle account, Kaggle collects certain information stored in connection with that account that you have configured that service to make available, including your email address, provider ID, first and last name, and profile picture.\nBy linking your accounts in this manner, you authorize Kaggle to access and use your account on the third party service in connection with your use of the Services.</p>\n<p>Why Kaggle Collects Information</p>\n<p>Kaggle uses the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>\n<p>Provide Our Services</p>\n<p>We use your information to deliver our Services, like administering competitions you enter or hosting datasets you upload or access.\nFor example, we use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a dataset.\nAnother example is that we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Kaggle account.</p>\n<p>Maintain &amp.\nImprove Our Services</p>\n<p>We also use your information to ensure our Services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.\nFor example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems.\nAnd if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p>\n<p>And we use your information to make improvements to our Services \u2013 for example, to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Kaggle account members and to improve the way the Services work and look.</p>\n<p>For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our Services, which can help us build better products.\nIt may help us discover that it\u2019s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all.\nWe can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p>\n<p>Develop New Services</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect in existing Services to help us create new features and functionality.</p>\n<p>Provide Personalized Services</p>\n<p>We use the information we collect to customize our Services for you, including remembering your information so that you will not have to log-in again the next time you visit the Services if you haven\u2019t signed out.\nWe also use data to provide customized third party content and information and to track your status in any Competitions or other activities.\nIn addition, we may use the information we collect to provide personalized and relevant content and advertising, for example showing you events near your location based on your IP address.</p>\n<p>Measure Performance</p>\n<p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our Services are used.\nFor example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design, monitor and analyze the operation and effectiveness of the Services and related activities, and monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.\nWe use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.\nGoogle Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by Kaggle.\nYou can opt-out from Google Analytics by clicking here.</p>\n<p>Communicate with You</p>\n<p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.\nFor example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity on your account, or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our Services.\nWe will also use your email address to contact you with respect to competition entries, prize awards and otherwise in connection with competitions.\nfor administrative and customer service purposes.\nto address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues.\nor regarding things you post on the Services.\nAnd if you contact Kaggle, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>\n<p>Kaggle also uses your email address or other personal information to send you messages about the Services and communications from other Members.\nWe may also send you messages related to the Services and the activities of third parties we work with.\nThese messages may be targeted at you based on your activities on our Services, for example your interaction with a particular dataset or your entry into a specific competition.\nYou will have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages, or by updating your Member Account settings through the Services.</p>\n<p>Protect Kaggle, Our Users, and the Public</p>\n<p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our Services.\nThis includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Kaggle, our users, or the public.\nFor example, we collect and analyze IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.\nThis abuse can take many forms, such as sending spam to Kaggle users or launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</p>\n<p>When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action.\nIn certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.</p>\n<p>Managing and Deleting Your Information</p>\n<p>Managing, Reviewing, and Updating Your Information</p>\n<p>When you\u2019re signed into your Kaggle account, you can always review and update information by visiting your account profile.</p>\n<p>Exporting, Removing &amp.\nDeleting Your Information</p>\n<p>You can export a copy of content in your Kaggle account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Kaggle by contacting us here.\nYou may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account settings page or editing your Kaggle account profile through the Services.</p>\n<p>You can also delete your discussion posts, uploaded datasets, and notebooks by using the available tools in our Services.\nIf desired, you can delete your entire Kaggle account by choosing that option in your account settings page.</p>\n<p>Please note that while your deletions are reflected promptly in active member databases, in some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes.\nSee \u201cData Retention\u201d below for more information.</p>\n<p>There are other ways to control the information Kaggle collects whether or not you\u2019re signed in to a Kaggle account, including configuring your browser to indicate when Kaggle has set a cookie in your browser.\nYou can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains.\nBut remember that our Services rely on cookies to function properly.</p>\n<p>Data Retention</p>\n<p>Information Retained Until You Remove It</p>\n<p>As we describe above, you can delete your entire Kaggle account or selectively delete your discussion posts, uploaded datasets, and notebooks by using the available tools in our Services.\nIn some cases, rather than provide a way to delete data, we store it for a predetermined period of time.\nFor each type of data, we set retention timeframes based on the reason for its collection.</p>\n<p>Information Retained For Extended Time Periods for Limited Purposes</p>\n<p>Sometimes business and legal requirements require us to retain certain information for specific purposes for an extended period of time.\nFor example, when you submit an entry in a competition, we may retain this information for a longer period of time to guard against cheating, for example, or for legal purposes.\nReasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security, fraud &amp.\nabuse prevention</li>\n<li>Financial record-keeping</li>\n<li>Complying with legal or regulatory requirements</li>\n<li>Ensuring the continuity of our services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Enabling Safe and Complete Deletion</p>\n<p>When you delete data in your Kaggle account, we immediately start the process of removing it from the product and our systems.\nFirst, we aim to immediately remove it from view.\nFor example, if you delete a post you made, we will immediately remove that from the public-facing Kaggle website.</p>\n<p>We then begin a process designed to safely and completely delete the data from our storage systems.\nSafe deletion is important to protect our users and customers from accidental data loss.\nComplete deletion of data from our servers is equally important for users\u2019 peace of mind.\nThis process generally takes around 2 months from the time of deletion.\nThis often includes up to a month-long recovery period in case the data was removed unintentionally.</p>\n<p>Each of our storage systems from which data gets deleted has its own detailed process for safe and complete deletion.\nThis might involve repeated passes through the system to confirm all data has been deleted, or brief delays to allow for recovery from mistakes.\nAs a result, deletion could sometimes take longer when extra time is needed to safely and completely delete the data.</p>\n<p>Our services also use encrypted backup storage as another layer of protection to help recover from potential disasters.\nData can remain on these systems for up to 6 months.</p>\n<p>As with any deletion process, things like routine maintenance, unexpected outages, bugs, or failures in our protocols may cause delays in the processes and timeframes defined in this article.\nWe maintain systems designed to detect and remediate such issues.</p>\n<p>Sharing Your Information</p>\n<p>When You Share Your Information</p>\n<p>Many of our Services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share.\nAny information that you voluntarily choose to include in an area of the Services accessible to other Kaggle members or the public, such as a public profile page or in a forum posting, will be available to other Kaggle members who access that content or the public (as applicable).\nThis also applies to information you choose to make available through features that connect to third party services, if applicable.</p>\n<p>Also, if you communicate directly with another Kaggle member, any information that you voluntarily choose to include in such a communication with other Kaggle members will be available to such other members.\nOnce you make your information available in any of these ways, it could be collected and used by the recipients without restriction.\nWe urge Kaggle members to exercise common sense, prudence and good judgment about what information to make available to others through the Services.</p>\n<p>When Kaggle Shares Your Information</p>\n<p>We do not sell your information.\nWe do, however, disclose your personal information in connection with developing and maintaining the Services and operating Competitions.\nWe share your personal information in the following cases:</p>\n<p>With your consent</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll share personal information outside of Kaggle when we have your consent.\nFor example, if you give us permission to share your information with a third party who may be a prospective employer.</p>\n<p>To operate competitions</p>\n<p>Kaggle may disclose your personal information to the hosts of competitions to enable your participation in the competitions and our operation of the competitions.\nThe terms of that disclosure are covered in the competition rules, which is a contract between you and the competition sponsor.</p>\n<p>For external processing</p>\n<p>We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.\nFor example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.\nThese third parties may have access to or process your personal information as a result of performing the services they were engaged to perform.</p>\n<p>For legal reasons</p>\n<p>We will share personal information outside of Kaggle if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request.</li>\n<li>Enforce our Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations, and take precautions against liability.</li>\n<li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security, or technical issues.</li>\n<li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Kaggle or our affiliates, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>\n<li>Protect the security or integrity of the Services and to protect or enforce third party rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners \u2014 like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders.\nFor example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our Services.\n</p>\n<p>If Kaggle is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we\u2019ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>\n<p>Our Commitment to Data Security</p>\n<p>Kaggle uses a variety of physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to improve the security of our systems and your personal information.</p>\n<p>If Kaggle learns of a security breach, we will notify you in accordance with applicable law.</p>\n<p>Third Party Websites</p>\n<p>The Services contain links to websites and services provided by third parties.\nAny personal information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party\u2019s policies governing privacy and security.\nWe are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links are displayed on the Services.\nWe encourage you to learn about third parties\u2019 privacy and security policies before providing them with personal information.</p>\n<p>Our Commitment to Children\u2019s Privacy</p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of children is especially important.\nFor that reason, Kaggle does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from persons under 13 years old, and no part of the Services is directed to persons under 13.\nIF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER.</p>\n<p>If Kaggle learns that personal information of children under 13 years old has been collected on the Services without verifiable parental consent, then Kaggle will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.\nIf you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a user account on the Services, then you may alert Kaggle at Kaggle Support and request that Kaggle delete that child\u2019s personal information from its systems.</p>\n<p>If you are between the ages of 13 and 16 years old, you may not use the Services until Kaggle has received verifiable parental consent for your use of the Services.\nIf you are between the ages of 13 and 17 years old or under the age of contractual majority in your country, you also may not enter any competitions until Kaggle has received verifiable parental consent for your entry into a specific competition.\nPlease check the eligibility rules for each competition to verify that minors are allowed to participate and ensure that the parental consent form is on file for each competition.\nMore information on the parental consent process can be found at Kaggle Support.</p>\n<p>Compliance &amp.\nCooperation with Regulators

located outside of the country where you live.\nData protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others.\nRegardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy.\nWe also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the European frameworks described below.</p>\n<p>When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint.\nWe work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.</p>\n<p>European Requirements </p>\n<p>If European Union (EU) data protection law applies to the processing of
