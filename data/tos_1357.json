Resolution, Arbitration.\nJurisdiction<p> 1.\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH MINDS AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\n</p>\n<p> a.\n<b>Binding Arbitration</b>.\nExcept for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) in which either Party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Minds (i) waive your and Minds\u2019 respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive your and Minds\u2019 respective rights to a jury trial.\nInstead, you and Minds will arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1 et seq.\n(\u201cFAA\u201d), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.\n(This includes the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).\n</p>\n<p> b.\n<b>No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions</b>.\nAny Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and Minds and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.\nThere will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals.\nFurther, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.\n</p>\n<p> c.\n<b>Notice.\nInformal Dispute Resolution</b>.\nEach Party will notify the other Party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.\nNotice to Minds shall be sent by email to Minds at info@minds.com.\nNotice to you shall be by email to the then-current email address in your Account.\nYour notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking.\nIf you and Minds cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) calendar days after the date notice is received by the applicable Party, then either you or Minds may, as appropriate and in accordance with these Terms, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in these Terms, file a claim in court.\n</p>\n<p> d.\n<b>Process</b>.\nAny arbitration will occur in the State of Connecticut.\nArbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (\u201cJAMS\u201d), which are hereby incorporated by reference.\nThe state and federal courts located in the State of Connecticut will have exclusive jurisdiction over (i) any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award, or (ii) any claim filed in court where permitted in these Terms.\n</p>\n<p> e.\n<b>Authority of Arbitrator.</b> As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.\nprovided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms.\nThe arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual\u2019s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.\n</p>\n<p> f.\n<b>Rules of JAMS.</b> The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the JAMS website.\nBy agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (i) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS, or (ii) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.\n</p>\n<p> g.\n<b>Injunctions and Court Proceedings.</b> With respect to any action or proceeding for which courts are an expressly permitted method of adjudication hereunder (set forth below), the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all such actions or proceedings arising out of, or related to, these Terms will be in an appropriate state or federal court located in the State of Connecticut.\n(the \u201cDesignated Courts\u201d), and the Parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal and subject matter jurisdiction of such court, waive any claim that such courts do not constitute a convenient and appropriate venue for such actions or proceedings, and waive the right to a trial by jury.\nEach Party consents to service of process upon itself by means of any of the methods for delivery of notice that are specified in these Terms.\n</p>\n<p> h.\nTo the extent that arbitration pursuant to the terms of this section is not permitted under applicable law, a Party may seek resolution of any dispute in the Designated Courts.\n</p>\n<p> i.\nTo the extent the Parties mutually-agree to forego arbitration for a dispute, the Parties shall seek resolution of such dispute in the Designated Courts.\n</p>\n<p> j.\nPermitted appeals and/or enforcement of an arbitration award shall take place in the Designated Courts.\n</p>\n<p> k.\nCertain breaches of these Terms by a User may, by its gravity or nature, cause immediate and irreparable injury to Minds that cannot be adequately compensated for in damages, including, without limitation, infringement of Minds\u2019 intellectual property rights.\nAccordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, in the event of any such breach and in addition to all other remedies available herein, Minds may seek solely injunctive relief from the Designated Courts without posting a bond or other security.\n</p>26.\nGoverning Law<p> 1.\nThese Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Connecticut or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.\n</p>27.\nWaiver and Severability<p> 1.\nNo waiver by Minds of any term or condition set out in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Minds to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n</p>\n<p> 2.\nIf any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.\n</p>28.\nNotice<p> 1.\n<b>To you: </b>We may provide any notice

remix under a Creative Commons Sharealike license.\n</p>1.\nOverview<p> Your privacy is important to Minds, Inc.\n(\u201cMinds\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d).\nIt is our policy to respect the privacy of our users regarding all information we may collect while operating our Services (defined in our Terms of Service).\nThis privacy policy applies to our Services.\nThis privacy policy sets forth what information we collect about users of the Services and explains how that information is used and protected.\n</p>\n<p>Minds\u2019 data privacy goals are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classify all data for proper security, transparency and fairness</li>\n<li>Policy enforced data privacy</li>\n<li> Empower users to control via opt-in the use, collection and deletion of their Personal Information </li>\n<li> Ensure users always know for what purpose their Personal Information will be used </li>\n<li>Compliance with US law</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Minds is encrypted via HTTPS, and we encrypt and/or hash all sensitive information while in motion or when stored at rest, including emails, passwords and private messages.\n</p>\n<p> Minds does not ask you for Personal Information unless it is required to provide certain features of the Services including, but not limited to user rewards, password reset, payments and two-factor authentication or Minds Token sales requiring AML/KYC data collection for certain purchasers.\n</p>\n<p> Minds does not willfully disclose the Personal Information of our users to anyone except to comply to applicable law or protect our rights.\n</p>2.\nAnonymity<p> As a cornerstone to our privacy policy, Minds users have the right, and are encouraged, to be anonymous.\nCertain features of the Services may require you to submit information (including Personal Information, which is defined below) as a condition to use certain features of the Services.\nWe collect your Personal Information when voluntarily submitted by you.\nThe Personal Information you provide is used to a create user account and login credentials for the purpose of using certain features of the Services and/or fulfilling your specific requests, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner.\nWe will not collect your Personal Information unless you give it to us.\n\u201cPersonal Information\u201d means any information that is classified as sensitive because it is personally identifiable such as a verified name, fingerprints or other biometric data, email address, street address, telephone number or social security number.\nSince anonymous data is de-identified by definition, and registration on Minds can be anonymous, Minds classifies nearly all site data as public.\nAll non-public data is either encrypted or hashed.\n</p>\n<p> Exceptions to the public default data classification include the following:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Logged-in users.</b> Data is accessible to logged-in users only</li>\n<li>\n<b>Unlisted data.</b> Data is classified as public, but it is not indexed and not accessible to anyone without knowledge of the URL.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Personal data.</b> Data that is personally identifiable such as email address, chat history or mobile number is classified as sensitive and therefore encrypted by policy when in motion or stored at rest using an SHA-256 unique hash ID.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Verified users.</b> Minds will verify users to a personal identity if a user requests to do so via Minds Plus.\nIn this case Minds privacy policy is to accept the request for verification as consent that the non-sensitive data from that channel will also be handled and marked as public.\n</li>\n</ul>3.\nTransparency<p> Internet users and content creators make a major commitment in terms of time and effort creating, curating and sharing.\nEveryone must trust their social media platform to be a reliable partner.\nMinds provides radical transparency in three ways:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) -</b> Minds software is free and open source end-to-end enabling expert inspection and peer review.\nFree and open source software enables user to \u201ctrust and verify\u201d that Minds software operates as documented and advertised.\nPlease view at https://gitlab.com/minds.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Blockchain -</b> Minds Wire and Minds Boost use Minds Tokens to record each transaction on the Ethereum distributed blockchain.\nUsing peer to peer smart contracts and distributed, autonomous processes, Minds Tokens eliminate payment provider middlemen and defeat bureaus of centralized authority and censorship.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Public Filings -</b> In May 2017 Minds filed and completed an SEC Regulation CF equity crowdfunding.\nMinds annual report and Form C public filings may be found at: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1703996/000167025417000102/.\n</li>\n</ul>4.\nGathering of Personal Information<p> Certain visitors to Minds\u2019 websites choose to interact with Minds in ways that require Minds to gather Personal Information.\nThe amount and type of information that Minds gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.\n</p>\n<p> For example, we may ask visitors who engage in transactions with Minds to provide additional information, such as necessary personal or financial information required to process those transactions.\nIn each case, Minds collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction with Minds.\n</p>\n<p> Minds databases are architected to never store Personal Information in raw form or readable to anyone including Minds staff.\nMinds does not disclose Personal Information other than as described herein.\nAnd visitors may be anonymous on Minds or opt-out and refuse to supply Personal Information under the caveat that they understand it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.\n</p>\n<p> There are four categories of sensitive information that is deemed Personal Information which may be collected and stored by Minds:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<b>Email address.</b> Minds stores and uses your email address to provide secure access to the web site.\nYour email address is encrypted.\nMinds uses your email to facilitate the Forgot Password function and to keep users updated with the network when offline.\nUsers are not required to provide an email, but are warned that access to their Minds channel may be permanently lost and irretrievable if the user ever forgets their password.\nIf you have supplied your email address, Minds may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with Minds and our products.\n<br>\n<br> In all promotional emails, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such messages in the future by clicking on the link at the bottom of the email that says \u201cunsubscribe.\u201d <br>\n<br> Even if you have unsubscribed from receiving promotional emails from us, we may send you other types of important email communications without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them, such as administrative notices, or Services-related communications (e.g., account verification, payment confirmations, technical and security notices).\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Chat history.</b> Minds messenger uses asymmetric encryption (public and private keys) to store the content of your messages.\nMessages are encrypted with a user's publicly available key and can only be decrypted using the password protected, private key belonging to the respective users.\nWe are using Openssl RSA 4096 / SHA 512 password protected keys.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Mobile phone number.</b> Minds requests your mobile phone number as a requirement to participate in our daily Minds Token rewards program.\nWe use the mobile number to establish a unique ID against which we may calculate daily rewards.\nThis prevents others from easily and unfairly making fake accounts and defrauding the reward pool.\nMinds does not store the phone numbers you provide.\nThe numbers are stored as a SHA-256 hash combined with a salt key.\nThe salt ensures that the numbers can not be matched unless the correct salt is provided.\n</li>\n<li>\n<b>Machine dependent data.</b> Minds may require access to services on your mobile device such as a microphone or camera to record a video on the mobile application.\nWe do not store IP addresses on Minds, and we do not use any such data for anything other than the stated purpose of providing utility to deliver the stated Minds Services.\n</li>\n</ul>5.\nWebsite Visitors<p> Minds encourages anonymity and has a mission to become free from all dependencies on third-party, proprietary software and infrastructure.\nHowever, from time to time we may use one or more third-party services to improve certain services on our network.\nIn order to provide you with the Services, we may share your Personal Information with certain authorized providers of third-party services (\u201cAuthorized Third Parties\u201d) who are authorized to act on behalf of Minds in connection with the Services.\nOur agreements with any such Authorized Third Parties states that they will not use any Personal Information received from us for any purpose other than performing services on our behalf.\n</p>\n<p> Like most website operators, Minds also collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nMinds\u2019 purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Minds\u2019 visitors use its website.\nFrom time to time, Minds may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.\n</p>6.\nOpen Data<p> Minds may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.\nFor instance, Minds
