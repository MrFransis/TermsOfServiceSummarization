never-ending loop lasting a few seconds.\nThis is all done locally on your Device and is not sent to Altice or any third party.\nIf a wake-up word is detected, your Device begins recording.\nIt does not record or retain any audio data, or begin to transmit any data until it is \u201cwoken up.\u201d You are notified that it is recording by a visual element, such as a light on the Device, and a

recording (for example, Amazon).\nAltice does not retain a copy of your voice recording.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>SECURITY:</strong> We employ physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Information.\nDespite these measures, We do not guarantee the security of information stored in our database or that unauthorized parties will not intercept information you send or receive over the

itself and its affiliates and subsidiaries authorized to provide the services set forth herein (collectively, \"Altice\") is pleased to provide its Service Protection plan (\"Plan\") to you in accordance with these terms and conditions, which incorporate and include the General Terms and Conditions of Service, Agreement for Optimum TV, Agreement for Optimum Online and Agreement for Optimum Voice, the Customer Privacy Notice, as applicable, and as such may be updated from time to time (collectively, the \"Terms of Service\").\nIn the event of any conflict between these Terms and Conditions below and the Terms of Service, the Terms of Service shall control.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Description:</strong>\n<p> The Service Protection plan (\"Plan\") is an optional monthly plan available to current Optimum customers which covers certain customer support calls and service visits related to Optimum TV, Optimum Online, and/or Optimum Voice services as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> The Plan covers the cost of service visits related to repair of inside wiring in connection with the delivery of the applicable Optimum TV, Optimum Online, and/or Optimum Voice services located on the Subscriber's side of the Demarcation Point, as well as certain inside wiring repairs.\nUnder this Plan, inside wiring shall be defined as cables, connectors, jacks, and other components necessary to receive the applicable Optimum service, except as limited in Section 2 of this Terms of Service.\nUnder this Plan, the Demarcation Point begins 12 inches outside of your home and extends inside to the individual outlets and extensions.\nFor apartments, condominiums, offices and/or other group or business facilities, the demarcation point is the outlet or jack inside the unit.</li>\n<li> The Plan offers priority positioning in the queue to speak with a live representative for certain customer support calls after Subscriber has exhausted self-service options.</li>\n<li> The Plan also covers the cost of service visits in which a subscriber calls customer support with an issue relating to the use of Optimum products or services and Altice subsequently determines that an in-home service visit is necessary to resolve issues related to inside wiring, connectors and other customer equipment (e.g., laptops, tablets, smartphones, smart TVs, etc.) necessary for the operation of Optimum products and services.\nFor example, the Plan would cover the cost of service visits to connect mobile WiFi devices, address incorrect equipment settings or connections or program remote controls.\nThe cost of the visit is covered even if it is determined that the issue is isolated to customer-owned or provided (as opposed to Altice-provided) equipment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Altice will perform all services under the Plan in accordance with industry standards.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Restrictions and Exclusions:</strong>\n<ol>\n<li> The Plan does not cover the cost of a scheduled service visit: <ol>\n<li> in the event of a missed appointment (i.e., Subscriber is not home or does not answer door at time of service visit).\nor</li>\n<li> in the event the appointment is cancelled at the time of the service visit (i.e., when the technician arrives at service location).</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> The Plan does not cover the following repairs and other services (although the cost of the service visit is covered): <ol>\n<li> repair of wire concealed within a wall or other inaccessible structure, i.e., wire that is wall fished;</li>\n<li> repair of non-Optimum equipment</li>\n<li> installation or configuration of non-Optimum equipment, with the exception of a customer-owned router or modem;</li>\n<li> repair of complex or custom wiring such as smart panels and long-distance HDMI;</li>\n<li> installation, removal, relocation of or change of Optimum services;</li>\n<li> repair or replacement of Ethernet/Cat5 cable or fittings, except as required to connect the Optimum Router to the cable modem and/or Subscriber computer.\nor</li>\n<li> repair of any damage or destruction caused by fire, flood, earthquake, Acts of God, vandalism, home renovation, gross negligence or willful damage.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Fees and Cancellation Policy:</strong>\n<ol>\n<li> Plan subscribers agree to pay the applicable monthly fee and if it applies, a cancellation fee.&nbsp.\nPlan fee will be billed monthly in advance for as long as the subscriber remains in the plan.&nbsp.\nResidential subscribers enrolled in Premier Technical Support (\"PTS Residential Subscriber(s)\") are automatically enrolled in the Service Protection plan without an additional fee (but not vice versa).&nbsp.\nBusiness subscribers enrolled in Premium Tech Support (\"PTS Business Subscriber(s)\") or Premier Protection &amp.\nSupport (\"PPS Business Subscribers\") are automatically enrolled in the Service Protection plan and receive the Plan without additional fee (but not vice versa).</li>\n<li> Plan subscribers may cancel at any time by calling (888) 705-7171 or contacting Altice at: 1111 Stewart Avenue, Bethpage, NY 11714, Attn: Service Protection.\n<ol>\n<li> If a Plan subscriber does not have an eligible service visit within the first thirty (30) days of the Plan, subscriber is entitled to a full refund of the applicable monthly fee.</li>\n<li> If a Plan subscriber schedules and/or receives an eligible service visit, or in the alternative, has a pending eligible service visit at the time of sign up for the Plan, and cancels within the first one hundred eighty (180) days of the Plan, the subscriber may be responsible for a cancellation fee of $25 for residential subscribers and $50 for business subscribers.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li> Additional fees may apply for work performed that is not covered by the Plan.</li>\n<li> PTS Residential Subscribers should refer to the Premier Technical Support Terms and Conditions for any applicable cancellation policy.\nPTS Business Subscribers and PPS Business Subscribers should refer to the Premium Tech Support for Business Terms and Conditions for any applicable cancellation policy.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Taxes and Fees:</strong> Subscriber agrees to pay any applicable local, state or federal taxes and/or fees imposed or levied on or with respect to the Plan.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Access to Subscriber Premises:</strong> Subscriber authorizes Altice and its employees, agents, contractors and representatives to access and otherwise enter the Subscriber's premises to install, inspect, maintain and/or make eligible, covered repair(s) and, upon the termination of Service, to remove the same from the premises.\nIf Subscriber is not the owner of the property where Altice will perform service visits, Subscriber hereby warrants and represents that Subscriber has obtained all necessary permissions from the owner of the property and Subscriber will indemnify Altice from any liability arising from a breach of the representation and warranty.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Altice shall not be liable for any damages (including indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind) arising from services performed under the Plan.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Amendment:</strong> Altice may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove portions of this Plan at any time.\nAltice may notify Subscriber of any such changes to this Plan by posting notice of such changes on the Optimum website or sending notice via e-mail or postal mail.\nThe Subscriber's continued participation in the Plan following notice of such change, modification or amendment shall be deemed to be the Subscriber's acceptance of any such modification.\nIf Subscriber does not agree to any modification of this Plan, Subscriber must cancel the Plan in accordance to Paragraph 3.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> Effective August 31,

(\"AUP\") has been created to promote the integrity, security, reliability, and privacy of Altice's Internet Product Network (the \"Service\").\nThe AUP works in conjunction with the Terms of Service (\"TOS\") of each particular product as set forth in each Agreement for service and specifies actions that are prohibited by users of the Service.\nAltice reserves the right to modify the AUP at any time and any such modifications shall be automatically effective to all users when adopted by Altice.\nThe customer recognizes and agrees that the then current version of the AUP to be maintained by Altice and posted on Altice's website will supercede all previous versions of this document.</p>\n<p> Use of the Service is subject to the following rules and guidelines as well as product specific TOS.\nEach User of the Service is responsible for ensuring that the use of all Services provided complies with this AUP and associated TOS.\nAny User who does not agree to be bound by these terms should immediately stop their use of the Service and notify the Altice Customer Service Department to terminate the account.</p>\n<p> Altice reserves the right in its sole discretion to suspend, deny, restrict or terminate use of the Service if such use violates the AUP, is objectionable or unlawful, interferes with the functioning of Altice's system or network or the Internet or use thereof by others.</p> Illegal Use\n<p> The Service may be used only for lawful purposes.\nTransmission or distribution of any material in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited.\nThis includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property right used without proper authorization, and material that is obscene, illegal, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.\nYour use of the Service is also subject to Altice's Copyright Infringement Policy.&nbsp.\nFurthermore, use of the Service to impersonate a person or entity is not permitted.</p> Prohibited Activities Using the System and Network\n<p> Any activity or use of the Service which violates system or network security or integrity are prohibited and may result in criminal and civil liability.&nbsp.\nSuch violations include, without limitation, the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Unauthorized access to or use of data, systems, or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of a system or network, relay communication through a resource, or to breach security or authentication measures without express authorization of the owner of the system or network.</li>\n<li> Unauthorized monitoring of data or traffic on any network or system without express authorization of the owner or network.</li>\n<li> Interference with service to any user, host, or network, including but not limited to: mail bombing, flooding, or denial of service attacks.</li>\n<li> Forging the header of any transmitted information packet, email, or Usenet posting.</li>\n<li> Modifying or tampering with any hardware, software, or configuration provided by Altice including but not limited to: routers, switches, and cable modem configuration files.</li>\n<li> Reselling or otherwise redistributing the Service.</li>\n<li> Disrupting any aspect of the Service through any means.</li>\n<li> Excessive use of bandwidth, that in Altice's sole opinion, places an unusually large burden on the network or goes above normal usage.\nAltice has the right to impose limits on excessive bandwidth consumption via any means available to Altice.&nbsp.\nAdditional information regarding our network management practices is available in Altice's Open Internet Disclosure Statement.</li>\n<li> Assuming or assigning a Altice IP address that was not allocated to the user by Altice or its network - all Optimum Online users must use DHCP&nbsp.\nassigned by the Service to acquire an IP address (with the exception of Optimum Online Static IP subscribers).</li>\n</ul>\n<p> &nbsp;</p> HIPAA\n<p> To the extent that you are a covered entity or business associate, as those terms are defined under the Administrative Simplification subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Pub.\nL.\n104-191, as amended, and its implementing regulations (collectively, \"HIPAA\"), you shall not maintain protected health information on the Service or otherwise use the Service in a manner that would cause Altice to qualify as a business associate under HIPAA.</p> Spam\n<p> Users may not send any unsolicited bulk or commercial email or electronic communication including, but not limited to, instant messenger programs, IRC, Usenet, etc.\nthat promotes or advertises a service, product, cause, opinion, money making opportunity, or the like that the recipient did not specifically request from the sender (\"Spam\").\nThese communications do not necessarily have to pass through the Service's email infrastructure - it only needs to originate from a Service User.</p>\n<p> Altice maintains a zero-tolerance policy on Spam for all of its Internet products and will take immediate action against users violating this AUP.\nAltice reserves the right to impose certain limitations on use of the Service's email.\nFor more information on certain of these limitations, click here.</p>\n<p> The Services may not be used to collect responses from unsolicited communication regardless of the communication's origination.\nMoreover, unsolicited communication may not direct the recipient to any web site or other resource that uses the Service and the user may not reference the Service in the header or by listing an IP address that belongs to the Service in any unsolicited communication even if that communication is not sent through the Service or its infrastructure.</p>\n<p> Users may not send any type of communication to any individual who has indicated that he/she does not wish to receive messages from them.\nContinuing to send email messages to anyone that has expressly requested not to receive email from a User is considered to be harassment.<br> &nbsp;</p> USENET/Internet Chat\n<p> Users may not SPAM newsgroups or chat rooms and must comply with the written charters, FAQs, rules, or terms of service for those forums the user chooses to participate.\nUsers are responsible for determining the policies of a given group/room before posting to it.\nAdditionally, Users are not permitted to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Cross-post the same or substantially similar message excessively - in Altice's sole opinion</li>\n<li> Post binary files to non-binary groups</li>\n<li> Flood or disrupt a group</li>\n</ul> Abusable Resources\n<p> Users shall take all necessary steps to avoid actions that result in the abuse of a resource on their network.\nExamples of abusable resources include but are not limited to: open news servers, open SMTP servers, insecure routers, wireless access and insecure proxy servers.\nUpon notification from Altice, Users are required to address the problem in a timely fashion.\nFailure to address an issue after notification will be considered a violation of this AUP.\nNot all products permit use of these types of services, please refer to your product specific TOS for further clarification.</p> User Responsibility\n<p> Users are solely responsible for the security and misuse of any device that is connected to the Service, regardless of whether the misuse was committed by the User or a third party with access to the User's Service account.&nbsp.\nAltice recommends that Users implement appropriate measures to secure their systems and these measures may include installation of firewalls, antivirus protection with regular updates, regularly checking for and applying security patches for software and operating systems, and general security conscience use of the Service.&nbsp.\nFurther, the speed at which a User connects to the Internet is dependent upon many factors, including a User's hardware and software and the activities in which the user is engaging.&nbsp.\nAltice does not guarantee or warrant any particular speed of Internet connection.</p> Viruses\n<p> Users must take appropriate action to prevent their systems from becoming infected with and/or distributing computer viruses.\nAltice will take appropriate (as decided by Altice) action against Users infected with computer viruses or worms to prevent further spread.</p> Enforcement\n<p> Altice reserves the right to investigate violations of this AUP, including the gathering of information from the Subscriber or other Users involved and the complaining party, if any, and the examination of material on Altice's servers and network.\nAltice prefers to advise Users of AUP violations and any necessary corrective action but, if Altice, in its sole discretion, determines that a User has violated the AUP, Altice will take any responsive action that is deemed appropriate without prior notification.\nSuch action includes but is not limited to: temporary suspension of service, reduction of service resources, and termination of service.\nAltice is not liable for any such responsive action and these actions are not exclusive.\nAltice may take any other legal or technical action it deems appropriate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p> The failure of Altice to enforce this AUP, for whatever reason, shall not be construed as a waiver of any right to do so at any time.</p>\n<p> &nbsp;</p>\n<p> Effective

(\"You\" or \"Subscriber\") agree to be bound to these General Terms and Conditions of Service (\"Terms of Service\" or \"Agreement\") with respect to all Optimum services (\"Service(s)\") provided by CSC Holdings, LLC and its affiliates and subsidiaries authorized to provide the services set forth herein (collectively, \"Altice\"), as well as the additional terms of service applicable to the specific Optimum services and/or features to\nwhich you subscribe or have access, as are set forth at www.optimum.net and may be updated from time to time, including the additional terms applicable to Optimum TV, Optimum Online, Optimum WiFi, Optimum Voice, support services, mobile apps and Auto Pay (collectively, the \"Additional Terms of Service\"), which are incorporated into these Terms of Service by this reference.\nYou further understand and agree that the Customer Privacy Notice, which governs the collection, use and disclosure of Subscriber personal\ninformation, is likewise incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong> THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND JURY TRIALS.\nTHE AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR OPTING OUT OF ARBITRATION.\nPLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 1.<strong> Payment of Charges.</strong> The charges for one month of Services, including any deposits, activation, installation and Equipment charges, plus pro rata charges, if any, for periods not previously billed, are due upon installation of the Services or such other date as agreed by Altice and You.\nThereafter, Subscriber agrees to pay monthly recurring Service charges and Equipment charges (if any) in advance, including all applicable fees (such as restoration or experience fees), taxes, regulatory fees, franchise fees, surcharges (including sports and broadcast TV surcharges) and other government assessments no later than the date indicated on Subscriber's bill.\nCharges for non-recurring Services or Equipment charges will be reflected on Subscriber's subsequent bill at the then current applicable rates.\nFor instance, Subscriber will be billed monthly for Pay Per View, On Demand or other Services ordered where charges are based on actual usage or on orders placed during the previous month.\nAll rates for Services, Equipment charges and other fees and surcharges are subject to change in accordance with applicable law.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> If Subscriber elects to pay by automatic recurring credit card, debit card or automatic clearing house payments, Subscriber authorizes Altice to charge such accounts.\nIf Subscriber elects to send a check as payment, Subscriber authorizes Altice either to use information from Subscriber's check to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from Subscriber's bank account or to process the payment as a check transaction.\n</p>\n<p> Failure to receive a bill does not release Subscriber from Subscriber's obligation to pay.\nFailure to pay the total balance when due (including checks returned for insufficient funds) shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and may be grounds for termination of Service, removal of Equipment from Subscriber's premises and/or imposition of a late fee (\"Late Fee\") in accordance with applicable law.\nYou can avoid incurring Late Fees by paying your monthly bill promptly.\nAny Late Fee imposed on Subscriber is intended to be a reasonable advance estimate of costs of managing past due accounts.\nThe Late Fee is not interest, a penalty, a credit service charge or a finance charge.\n</p>\n<p> If the Subscriber has more than one account (Business and/or Residential) served by Altice, all Altice provided Services at all locations may be subject to discontinuance of Service in the event any one account remains unpaid.\nIn the event collection activities are required, an additional collection charge may be imposed.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Monthly Charges.</strong> Your monthly subscription begins on the first day following your installation date and automatically renews thereafter on a monthly basis beginning on the first day of the next billing period assigned to you until cancelled by you.\nThe monthly service charge(s) will be billed at the beginning of your assigned billing period and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your Service(s).\nPAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD(S).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> You may cancel Service(s) for a period up to the last day of the billing period prior to the service period that you wish to cancel, and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current billing period.\nAny request for cancellation after the commencement of a service period will be effective at the end of the then-current service period.\nAccess to the Services will, if possible, continue to be provided at the location ordered or, if you move, to your new location if in an Altice-served area (subject to any installation charges).\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 2.<strong> Additional Fees.</strong> In addition to Subscriber's monthly recurring charges and any Late Fee, additional fees may be imposed, including fees for returned checks, Payment Assistance Fees for paying by phone, receiving a paper bill, charge card chargeback, early termination, reconnection and service calls.\nAdditional charges may also be imposed if collection activities are required to recover past due balances, including attorney fees.\nA list of applicable\nfees is available at optimum.net/pricing-packages (\"Schedule of Fees\").\nAltice reserves the right to amend or change the Schedule of Fees from time to time.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 3.<strong> Third Party Provider Charges.</strong> In connection with Subscriber's use of the Services and Equipment, Subscriber may be able to access, subscribe to, use and/or purchase products, services, software or applications that are provided to Subscriber by third parties (\"Third Party Providers\").\nSubscriber acknowledges that Subscriber may incur charges in connection with the subscription to, purchase or use of these Third Party Provider products, services, software or applications.\nAll such charges, including any additional fees and applicable taxes, shall be paid by Subscriber to the Third Party Provider and are not the responsibility of Altice.\nCredits or billing adjustments for products, services, software or applications billed by a Third Party Provider shall be subject to the stated billing practices of that Third Party Provider.\nTermination of a service or subscription offered for a separate charge billed directly by a Third Party Provider shall be effected in accordance with the Terms of Service or similar agreement between the Subscriber and the Third Party Provider.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 4.\n<strong>Taxes:</strong> Subscriber agrees to pay any local, state or federal taxes imposed or levied on or with respect to the Services, the Equipment or installation or service charges incurred with respect to the same.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 5.\n<strong>Early Termination Fees.</strong> If you cancel, terminate or downgrade the Service(s) before the completion of any required promotional term to which You agreed (\"Initial Term\"), you agree to pay Altice any applicable early cancellation fee plus all outstanding charges for all Services used and Equipment purchased for which you have not paid us prior to termination.\nYou agree that early cancellation fees or any other fees may automatically be charged to your account and your credit or debit card provided to Altice and you agree to pay such fees.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 6.\n<strong>Right to Make Credit Inquiries.</strong> Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that Altice may (a) verify Subscriber's credit standing, make inquiries and receive information about your credit experiences, including your credit report, from credit reporting agencies.\n(b) enter this information in your file, and disclose this information concerning you to appropriate third parties for reasonable business purposes.\nand (c) furnish information about you (including your social security number), your account(s) and your payment history to those credit reporting agencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 7.\n<strong>Security Deposit.</strong> Altice may require a deposit or activation fee based on Subscriber's credit standing or past payment history with Altice.\nA deposit and/or activation fee does not relieve the Subscriber of the responsibility for prompt payment of bills on presentation.\nAny security deposit given by Subscriber for the Equipment or Altice's Service will be due and payable upon the first monthly billing.\nSuch security deposits will be returned to Subscriber within sixty (60) days of termination of Altice's Service so long as payment has been made for all amounts due on Subscriber's account and Subscriber has returned the Altice Equipment undamaged.\nSecurity deposits paid by Subscriber for Equipment or Services may be used, to the extent permitted by law, to offset any unpaid balance or charges after termination of Service.\nSubscriber shall remain liable for any outstanding balances after the security deposit has been applied.\nFurther terms and conditions of the security deposit may be contained in the deposit receipt given to Subscriber at the time the security deposit is collected.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 8.\n<strong>Disputed Charges.</strong> Subscriber agrees to pay all undisputed monthly charges and all applicable fees and taxes as itemized on the Altice monthly bill and notify Altice in writing of disputed items or requests for credit within thirty (30) days of Subscriber's receipt of the bill for which correction of an error or credit is sought, or longer as provided by applicable law.<strong>\n</strong>The date of the dispute shall be the date Altice receives sufficient documentation to enable Altice to investigate the dispute.\nThe date of the resolution is the date Altice completes its investigation and notifies the Subscriber of the disposition of the dispute.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 9.\n<strong>Adjustments or Refunds.</strong> Any adjustment or refund, given in each case at Altice's sole discretion, will be accomplished by a credit on a subsequent bill for Service, unless otherwise required by applicable law.\nExcept as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the liability of Altice, its officers, shareholders, directors, employees, affiliates, vendors, carrier partners, content providers and other persons or entities involved in providing the Services or Equipment (collectively, the \"Altice Parties\") for damages shall in no event, by reason of any delays, interruptions, omissions, errors, failures or defects in installation or service, exceed an amount equal to the Subscriber's Service charges and associated Equipment fees for a regular billing period (\"Maximum Credit\").\nNo credit allowance will be made for interruptions of Service that are:\n</p>\n<p> a.\ndue to the negligence of or noncompliance with the provisions of the Terms of Service by Subscriber or any person authorized by customer to use the Service.\n</p>\n<p> b.\ndue to the negligence of any person other than Altice including, but not limited to, the other common carriers connected to Altice's facilities.\n</p>\n<p> c.\ndue to the failure or malfunction of Subscriber-owned equipment or third party equipment.\n</p>\n<p> d.\nduring any period in which Altice is not given full and free access to its facilities and Equipment for the purpose of investigating and correcting interruptions.\n</p>\n<p> e.\nduring a period in which Subscriber continues to use the Service on an impaired basis.\n</p>\n<p> f.\nduring any period when the interruption is due to implementation of a Subscriber order for a change in Service arrangements.\nor\n</p>\n<p> g.\ndue to circumstances or causes beyond the control of Altice.\n</p>\n<p>\n<u>Limitation of Refund.</u> Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, in the event any amounts owed by Altice to Subscriber are not claimed by Subscriber within one year of the date on which the amount became payable to Subscriber, Subscriber shall forfeit all rights to the refund and all such amounts shall become the property of Altice.<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 10.\n<strong>Equipment and Software.</strong> Unless Altice expresses otherwise in writing, all equipment, including but not limited to, any cables, wires, amplifiers, cable boxes, access cards, remotes, cable cards, battery backup units, modems, routers, gateways, Altice One and Altice One Mini units distributed to and/or installed for use in the Subscriber's service location(s) by or on behalf of Altice (\"Equipment\"), network facilities, and software installed or provided by Altice remains the property of Altice, except that all wiring on the Subscriber's side of the demarcation point at Subscriber's service location, whether installed by Altice or by Subscriber, shall be Subscriber property and not Altice Equipment, and repair and maintenance for such wiring is the responsibility of Subscriber unless otherwise agreed by Subscriber and Altice.\nThe demarcation point shall mean a point at (or about) twelve (12) inches outside of where the cable wire enters the Subscriber's service location.\nNone of the Equipment shall become a fixture nor shall distribution, installation, and/or use of Equipment, including but not limited to cable boxes and/or set top boxes be deemed a lease of such Equipment.\nSubscriber will acquire no ownership or other interest in the Equipment, network facilities, and software by virtue of payments made pursuant to this Agreement or by the attachment of any portion of the Equipment or\nnetwork facilities to Subscriber's residence or premises.\n</p>\n<p> a.\n<u>Misuse of Equipment.</u> Altice Equipment is intended to service and reside at the specific service location and is not to be removed from the service location where it was installed or used off premises without Altice authorization.\nSubscriber agrees that neither Subscriber nor any other person (except Altice's authorized personnel) will\nopen, alter, misuse, tamper with, service, or make any alterations to any Equipment.\nSubscriber agrees to safeguard the Equipment from loss or damage of any kind, and (except for any self installation procedures approved by Altice) will not permit anyone other than an Altice authorized representative to perform any work on the Equipment.\nAny misuse, alteration, tampering, or removal, or the use of equipment which permits the receipt of Services without authorization or the receipt of Services to an unauthorized number of outlets, or to unauthorized locations constitutes theft of service and is prohibited.\n</p>\n<p> b.\n<u>Return of Equipment</u>.\nIf Subscriber's Service is terminated or cancelled (for whatever reason), unless Altice expresses otherwise in writing, Subscriber agrees that Subscriber no longer has the right to keep or use the Equipment and Subscriber must promptly return the Equipment.\nThe Equipment must be returned to Altice in the same condition as when received, ordinary wear and tear excepted.\nAbsent other instructions, if Subscriber fails to return the Equipment, Subscriber will pay any expenses Altice incurs in retrieving the Equipment.\nFailure of Altice to remove the Equipment does not mean that Altice has abandoned the Equipment.\nAltice may impose a charge for unreturned Equipment to be determined in accordance with Altice's then current schedule of charges for non-returned Equipment and/or continue to charge Subscriber a monthly Service fee every month until any remaining Equipment is returned, collected by Altice or fully paid for by Subscriber.\nAny charge for unreturned Equipment shall be due immediately.\n</p>\n<p> c.\n<u>Damaged or Lost Equipment.</u> If the Equipment is damaged by Subscriber, destroyed, lost or stolen while in Subscriber's possession, Subscriber is responsible for the cost of repair or replacement of the Equipment.\n</p>\n<p> d.\n<u>Operation of Equipment</u>.\nSubscriber agrees to operate any Equipment in accordance with instructions of Altice or Altice's agent.\nFailure to do so will relieve the Altice Parties of liability for interruption of Service and may make the Subscriber responsible for damage to Equipment.\n</p>\n<p> e.\n<u>Tests and Inspections</u>.\nUpon reasonable notification to the Subscriber, and at a reasonable time, Altice may make such tests and inspections as may be necessary to determine that the Subscriber is complying with the requirements set forth herein.\n</p>\n<p> f.\n<u>Software</u>.\nSubscriber agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of any software license agreement applicable to the software provided or installed by Altice (\"Software\").\nThe Software shall be used solely in connection with the Services and Subscriber will not modify, disassemble, translate or reverse engineer, the Software.\nAll rights title and interest to the Software, including associated intellectual property rights, are and will remain with Altice and Altice?s licensors.\nIf Subscriber's Service is terminated, Subscriber will promptly return or destroy all Software provided by Altice and any related written materials.\nAltice will have the right to upgrade, modify and enhance the Equipment and Software from time to time.\n</p>\n<p> g.\n<u>Repair</u>.\nAltice will repair and/or replace defective Equipment provided such damage was not caused by misuse, neglect or other fault of Subscriber.\nAltice assumes no responsibility and shall have no responsibility for the operation, maintenance, condition or repair of any Subscriber-provided equipment and/or software, including, but not limited to, televisions, computer devices, remote controls or other consumer electronics, including any hardware or third party software, that may be connected to the Services (\"Subscriber Equipment\") except that Altice may automatically push required software or firmware updates directly to Subscriber Equipment when necessary for the provision of Altice Service(s).\nSubscriber is responsible for the repair and maintenance of Subscriber Equipment.\nSubscriber is also responsible for the repair and maintenance of inside wiring at the service location unless otherwise agreed by Subscriber and Altice.\nAltice is not responsible or liable for any loss or impairment of Altice's Service due in whole or in part to a malfunction, defect or otherwise caused by Subscriber Equipment.\nAltice makes no warranties, with respect to Equipment or Service provided by Altice or with respect to the Equipment's compatibility with any Subscriber Equipment.\n</p>\n<p> 11.\n<strong>Prohibitions.</strong>\n</p>\n<p> a.\n<u>Residential Use</u>.\nThe Services provided under this Agreement are solely for Subscriber's personal, residential use and Subscriber shall not use Services for any commercial purpose.\nAltice shall have the right to determine, in its sole discretion, what constitutes a \"commercial\" purpose.\n</p>\n<p> b.<strong>\n</strong>\n<u>Theft of Service</u>.\nSubscriber shall not intercept, receive or assist in the interception or receipt of, resell, distribute or duplicate any Services.\nIn no event shall Subscriber use the Services and/or Equipment to engage in any illegal or prohibited activity.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 12.\n<strong>Subscriber Liability for Users.</strong> Subscriber must be at least eighteen years of age to subscribe to Services.\nSubscriber is responsible for any access, use or misuse of the Services and/or Equipment that may result from access or use by any other person who has access to Subscriber's premises, equipment or account.\nSubscriber is responsible for ensuring that all persons who use Subscriber's Services (each, a \"User\") understand and comply with all terms and conditions applicable to the Services.\n</p>\n<p> 13.\n<strong>Access to Subscriber Premises.</strong> Subscriber grants Altice and its employees, agents, contractors and representatives the right to access and otherwise enter the Subscriber's premises and to access Equipment, the wiring within Subscriber's premises and Subscriber's computer(s) and other devices to install, connect, inspect, maintain, repair, replace, disconnect, remove or alter the Equipment, check for signal leakage or install or deliver Altice provided Software.\nSubscriber shall cooperate in providing such access upon request of Altice.\nIf Subscriber is not the owner of the premises, Subscriber warrants that Subscriber has obtained the legal authority of the owner to authorize Altice personnel and/or its agents to enter the premises for the purposes described herein.\nAltice's failure to remove its Equipment shall not be deemed an abandonment thereof.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong> 14.\n<strong>Violations of this Agreement.</strong> It shall be a violation of this Agreement for Subscriber or any User: (1) to engage in any conduct prohibited by this Agreement (or by any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference).\nor (2) not to engage in conduct required by this Agreement, each case determined in Altice?s sole good faith discretion.\nIn addition, whether or not the conduct set forth below is elsewhere prohibited by this Agreement, it shall be a violation of this Agreement if:\n</p>\n<p> a.\nSubscriber or any User fails to abide by Altice?s rules and regulations or to pay the charges billed.\n</p>\n<p> b.\nSubscriber or any User fails to provide and maintain accurate registration information or the

and all disputes arising between You and Altice, including its respective parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, predecessors, and successors, shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis in accordance with this arbitration provision.\nThis agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted.\nIt includes, but is not limited to:\n</p>\n<p> \u00b7 Claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory.\n</p>\n<p> \u00b7 Claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement.\nand\n</p>\n<p> \u00b7 Claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either You or Altice may bring claims in small claims court in Your jurisdiction, if that court has jurisdiction over the parties and the action and the claim complies with the prohibitions on class, representative, and private attorney general proceedings and non-individualized relief discussed below.\nYou may also bring issues to the attention of federal, state, and local executive or administrative agencies.\n</p>\n<p> Resolving Your dispute with Altice through arbitration means You will have a fair hearing before a neutral arbitrator instead of in a court before a judge or jury.\n<strong> YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ALTICE EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> a.\n<strong>\n<u>Opting Out of Arbitration</u>\n</strong>.\n<strong> IF YOU HAVE BEEN AN EXISTING SUBSCRIBER FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

THAT YOU MAY HAVE WITH ALTICE.\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> b.\n<u>Pre-Arbitration Process</u>.\n</p>\n<p> (i) Notice Of Dispute.\nBefore commencing an action in arbitration, You must first notify us of Your dispute and allow us an opportunity to resolve it without the need for arbitration.\nYou must write us a letter briefly explaining the dispute and stating the relief that You demand.\nProvide as much information as possible, including where applicable dates and specific amounts of money.\nAlso include the account holder's name, the account number, the service address, and a telephone number at which You may be reached during business hours.\nFor Your convenience, You may download a Notice of Dispute form from our website at http://static.tvlistings.optimum.net/ool/static/prod/images/OptimumNoticeofDisputeForm4-8-21.pdf.\nOnce you have written the letter or filled out the Notice, send it to us by certified mail at Altice Shared Services, 1111 Stewart Ave, Bethpage, NY 11714, Attn: Customer Disputes.\n</p>\n<p> (ii) 30 Day Wait Period.\nIf Altice has not been able to resolve your dispute to your satisfaction within 30 days from when we received your Notice of Dispute, you may start arbitration proceedings.\n</p>\n<p> c.\n<u>Commencing an Arbitration</u>.\nTo commence an arbitration, You must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, with a copy to Altice.\nA Demand for Arbitration form can be found on the AAA website at https://www.adr.org/rulesformsfees.\n</p>\n<p> d.\n<u>Arbitration Process</u>.\nThe arbitration will be administered by the AAA under the AAA?s Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision.\nYou may obtain copies of those rules from the AAA at www.adr.org.\nIf the AAA will not enforce this arbitration provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve Your dispute.\nIf this situation arises, or if the AAA for any reason cannot serve as the arbitration organization, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization or ad hoc arbitration, which will enforce this arbitration provision as to the dispute.\nIf the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization or ad hoc arbitrator that will administer arbitration under this arbitration provision as written.\nIf there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the AAA rules, this arbitration provision shall govern.\n</p>\n<p> A single arbitrator will resolve the dispute between You and Altice.\nParticipation in arbitration may result in limited discovery.\nThe arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect confidential or proprietary information, including subscriber personally identifiable information.\n</p>\n<p> All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision, or the interpretation of its prohibitions of class, representative, and private attorney general proceedings and non-individualized relief shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.\nThe Arbitrator is limited and bound by terms of this arbitration provision.\nAlthough the arbitrator shall be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same customer to the extent required by applicable law, the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers.\nThe arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.\nAn award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\n</p>\n<p> Unless the parties agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in the county (or parish) of Your service address.\nIf the amount in dispute is less than $50,000, Altice agrees that You may choose whether the arbitration is conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, by a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by AAA rules.\n</p>\n<p> If the amount in dispute exceeds $75,000 or the claim seeks any form of injunctive relief, either party may appeal the award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by AAA by a written notice of appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of the written arbitration award.\nAn award of injunctive relief shall be stayed during any such appeal.\nThe members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to AAA rules.\nThe three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within one hundred and twenty (120) days of the date of the appealing party's notice of appeal.\nThe decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, subject to any right of judicial review that exists under the FAA.\n</p>\n<p> e.\n<u>Arbitration Fees.</u> Except as otherwise provided in this arbitration provision, Altice will pay all arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration that Altice commences or that You commence seeking damages of $10,000 or less.\nIf You commence an arbitration seeking greater than $10,000 in damages, arbitration filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees shall be allocated in accordance with the AAA rules.\nIf You cannot pay Your share of these fees, You may request a fee waiver from the AAA.\nIn addition, Altice will consider reimbursing Your share of these fees if You indicate You cannot afford them and, if appropriate, will pay directly all such fees upon Your written request prior to the commencement of the arbitration.\nYou are responsible for all additional costs and expenses that You incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys' or expert witness fees and expenses, unless the arbitrator determines that applicable law requires Altice to pay those costs and expenses.\n</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the arbitrator concludes that Your claim is frivolous or has been brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the AAA rules shall govern the allocation of arbitration fees, and You agree to reimburse Altice for any amounts Altice may have paid on Your behalf.\n</p>\n<p> f.\n<u>Governing Law</u>.\nBecause the Service(s) provided to You involves interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of all disputes under this arbitration provision.\nAny state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall not be applicable.\n</p>\n<p> g.\n<strong>\n<u>Waiver of Class and Representative Actions.</u>\n</strong>\n<strong> YOU AGREE TO ARBITRATE YOUR DISPUTE AND TO DO SO ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\nCLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, AND PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ARBITRATIONS AND ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.\n</strong> You and Altice agree that each party may bring claims against the other only in Your or its individual capacity and may not participate as a class member or serve as d plaintiff in any purported class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding.\nThis arbitration provision does not permit and explicitly prohibits the arbitration of consolidated, class, or representative disputes of any form.\nIn addition, although the arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award that is individualized to the claimant and would not affect other Altice account holders, neither You nor Altice may seek, nor may the arbitrator award, non-individualized relief that would affect other account holders.\nFurther, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's claims unless all parties affirmatively agree in writing.\n</p>\n<p> If any of the prohibitions in the preceding paragraph is held to be unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court.\nIn that instance, or any instance when a claim between You and Altice proceeds to court rather than through arbitration, You and Altice each waive the right to any trial by jury through this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p> h.\n<u>Severability and Survival</u>.\nIf any other portion of this arbitration provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the remainder of this arbitration provision shall be given full force and effect.\nThe terms of the arbitration provision shall survive termination, amendment or expiration of this Agreement.\n</p>\n<p> 25.\n<strong>Governing Law.</strong> Subject to Section 24.f above, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 26.\n<strong>Severability.</strong> If any term or condition of this Agreement shall be adjudicated or determined as invalid or unenforceable by a court, tribunal or arbitrator with appropriate jurisdiction over the subject matter, the remainder of the Agreement with respect to such claim shall not be affected and shall remain valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 27.\n<strong>No Relationship.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement will create any joint venture, joint employer, franchisee-franchisor, employer-employee or principal-agent relationship between Altice and any content, backbone, network, circuit and other technology or communications providers, software and other licensors, hardware and equipment suppliers or other third party providers of elements of the high speed internet service, nor impose upon any such companies any obligations for any losses, debts or other obligations incurred by the other.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 28.\n<strong>Survival.</strong> All representations, warranties, indemnifications, dispute resolution provisions and limitations of liability contained in this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, as well as any other obligations of the parties hereunder which, by their terms, would be expected to survive such termination or which relate to the period prior to termination (including legal conditions, payment, and Altice rights and the rights of others).<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 29.\n<strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Altice Parties shall not be liable for any delay or failure of performance or Equipment due to causes beyond its control, including but not limited to: acts of God, fire, flood, explosion or other catastrophes.\nany law, order, regulation, direction, action or request of the United States government or of any other government including state and local governments having or claiming jurisdiction over Altice, or of any department, agency, commission, bureau, corporation or other instrumentality of any one or more of these federal, state, or local governments or of any military authority.\npreemption of existing service in compliance with national emergencies, acts of terrorism, insurrections, riots, wars, unavailability of\nrights-of-way, material shortages, strikes, lockouts, or work stoppages.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 30.\n<strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms of Service, including the applicable Additional Terms of Service and Customer Privacy Notice, your work/service order and the Schedule of Fees constitute the entire agreement between the Subscriber and Altice with respect to the Services.\nNo undertaking, representation or warranty made by an agent or representative of Altice in connection with the sale, installation, maintenance or removal of Altice's Services or Equipment shall be binding on Altice except as expressly included herein.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> 31.\n<strong>Amendment.\nNotice.\n</strong> Altice may, in its sole discretion, change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service at any time.\nAltice may notify Subscriber of any such changes to these Terms of Service, or any other required or desired notice hereunder, by posting notice of such changes on Altice?s website, or by sending notice via email or postal mail to Subscriber's billing address, and/or by contacting the telephone number(s) on Subscriber's account (including mobile phones) by means such as but not limited to browser bulletins, walled garden (browser interruption), voice, SMS, MMS, and text messages, including by the use of by automatic telephone dialing systems.\nSubscriber agrees that any one of the foregoing will constitute sufficient notice.\nBecause Altice may from time to time notify Subscriber about important information regarding the Services, the Privacy Notice and these Terms of Service by such methods, Subscriber agrees to regularly check his\nor her postal mail, e-mail and all postings on the Altice web site (www.optimum.net) and Subscriber bears the risk of failing to do so.\nThe Subscriber's continued use of the Service(s) following notice of such change, modification or amendment shall be deemed to be the Subscriber's acceptance of any such revision.\nIf Subscriber does not agree to any revision of these Terms of Service, Subscriber must immediately cease use of all Services and notify Altice that Subscriber is cancelling this Agreement in accordance with the then-current policy.\n<strong>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p> Effective September 28, 2018\n</p> Need Help?
