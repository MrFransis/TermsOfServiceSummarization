the same browser, you will be identified as a different user with a different Browser ID.\n</p>\n<p>This is only so we can count unique users and repeat users for each of our Sites.\nWe can determine which of our Sites receive more repeat visits and which type of content causes users to come back to the Sites.\n</p>\n<strong>A unique ID code assigned to you based on your email address or your IP

ads that you clicked on.\n<strong>Additional Information when you install one of our applications</strong>\n<p>If you install a browser extension, an installation ID will be created and tied to your

to your unique app ID, which may include a Google Advertising ID, Amazon Advertising ID or Apple IDFA, respectively.\n</p>\n<p>This is to count search queries, clicks, page views, repeat visits, time on site and in apps, and other metrics so we can determine which search queries are trending, which content, web page layouts or user interface are the most popular or generates the most revenues and which app features are the most used.\n</p>\n<p>This is also to determine payments owed to content and advertising partners, as well as marketing agencies.\n</p>\n<strong>Other technical

experience, such as by providing personalized elements and showing you content based on your recent interests.\nWe may use automated decision-making for these activities.\nUpon your affirmative consent or request, we may use your browser information to send you notifications about content on our site via your browser.\nAs required by applicable data protection and privacy laws, we will obtain your consent for these activities or enable you to opt out of these activities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third party links.\n</strong>The Sites include many links to third-party websites, services, widgets, ads, and other services.\nClicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you.\nWe do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy practices.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Notice of Financial Incentive.\n</strong>This Notice of Financial Incentive applies to sweepstakes and other giveaways offered by AMG.</p>\n<ol>\n<p>Program Detail.\nBy signing up for one of our newsletters, you may be eligible, where indicated, to participate in a drawing for a cash prize or other valuable prize.\nThe full terms and conditions of the sweepstakes will be set forth where the opportunity to enter the sweepstakes is offered.\nWe collect identifiers, such as email addresses, which you provide when you enter the sweepstakes.</p>\n<p>Value of Consumer Data.\nWe treat the value of Consumer data collected through the program as the equivalent of relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of Consumers\u2019 PI as part of the program.\nThe financial incentive we offer to consumers through the program reasonably relate to the value of the consumer\u2019s

purposes described below: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fraud prevention: we may disclose your information to third parties when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others.</li>\n<li>Law enforcement purposes and public safety: if requested or required by government authorities, such as law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law, we may disclose any information we have about our users.\nWe may disclose information collected about you in order to exercise or protect legal rights or defend against legal claims.\nWe also may be required to disclose an individual\u2019s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>\n<li> Other IAC businesses: We are part of the IAC family of businesses (go to www.iac.com for a listing of these businesses).\nWe may share information we collect, including personal information, with the IAC companies.\nSharing information with our IAC companies enables us to provide you with information about a variety of products and services that might interest you.\n</li>\n<li>Sale or merger of our business: we may transfer your information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets).\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p> 5) Your Opt Out Rights and Choices\n<p>You have rights and choices regarding our collection and use of your personal information, as well as the collection and use of some of our third party partners.\nA few of those choices are set forth below and others are described in our Cookie Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Removing our cookie.</strong> If you remove our Browser ID cookie from your browser cache, we will no longer recognize your browser and activities until a new cookie is placed.\nAny future site activities you perform after you delete this cookie will not be tied to your previous activities which were associated with the removed cookie.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Removing Interest based advertising cookies.</strong> You can opt-out of third-party interest-based, advertising-related cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, to prevent our advertising partners to deliver targeted interest based ads to you.\nYou can choose to opt-out through these (and other) resources: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Network Advertising Initiative (http://www.networkadvertising.org/)</li>\n<li>Digital Advertising Alliance (http://www.aboutads.info/consumers)</li>\n<li>Your Online Choices (http://www.youronlinechoices.com/)</li>\n</ul> You will continue to see advertisements on our Sites, but they will not be tailored to you based on any past behavior on our Sites or other websites.\nYou may, however, still receive customized content and/or ads based on the search queries you submitted or the content of the pages you are visiting.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Removing LiveRamp ID Codes.</strong> When you use our Sites or subscribe to one of our newsletters, we share information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system, with our data connectivity service providers such as LiveRamp.\nThese service providers enable us to implement cross-channel advertising and may share your information with third party advertising companies to enable cross-site and cross device interest-based targeted advertising.\nTo opt out of this use by LiveRamp, please click here.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Removing Interest-based advertising from Mobile Tracking Devices.</strong> You may opt out of tracking and receiving tailored advertisements on your mobile device by some mobile advertising companies and other similar entities by downloading the App Choices app at https://youradchoices.com/appchoices\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other Privacy Tools.</strong> In addition, third party tools enable you to search for and opt-out of some of these devices, such as the Ghostery browser plug-in available at https://www.ghostery.com/.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Do Not Track (DNT) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties.\nHowever, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>For California users: Opt out of sharing for Interest Based Advertising (\u201cDo Not Sell\u201d).</strong> There is no industry consensus on whether enabling third parties to collect personal data via cookies for interest based targeting is a \u201csale\u201d under California Consumer Privacy Act.\nWe however want to give you choices regarding third parties using cookies or tracking devices to collect information about your internet usage while you visit our Sites (see the second chart in Section 2 above for more details on these practices).\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Some browsers have signals that may be characterized as Do Not Sell signals, but we do not understand them to operate in that manner or to indicate a do not sell expression by you, so we currently do not recognize these as a do not sell request.\nWe understand that various parties are developing do not sell signals and we may recognize certain such signals if we conclude such a program is appropriate.</p>\n<p>If you do not wish for our advertising partners and certain data connectivity service providers to collect your personal information for interest based advertising purposes, click the button below to \u201cOpt Out\u201d.\nAs an alternative way to exercise your Opt Out right, you may contact us via our HelpDesk and we can provide further instructions on how to use the Opt Out button below.\nWe manage Opt Out requests on a per browser basis, using your Browser ID cookie.\nThis means that we need access to your browser when you click on the Opt Out button below in order to respond to your Opt Out request.\nWe therefore cannot process any Opt Out request from a third party acting as your agent.\n</p>\n<strong>Opt Out of Third Party Sharing for Interest Based Advertising</strong> This function is not activated if you do not have a California IP address.\nIf the button is not active, please try again from a California location.\n<p> You have opted out of third party sharing by Life123.com for interest based advertising.\nWe will no longer allow our advertising partners to use the personal information gathered from your browser\u2019s activities for interest based targeting to you across various websites and services.\nWe participate in the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework for Publishers &amp.\nTechnology Companies (\u201cIAB Framework\u201d).\nWhen you use the above toggle to opt-out, to the extent we sell your personal information in order to deliver ads tailored to your interests, we will notify downstream participants of the IAB Framework that receive personal information about you to only use your personal information for those specific and limited purposes that are permitted under the IAB Framework.\nHowever, while we do our best to contractually restrict our advertising partners, including via the IAB Framework, we do not always have the means to verify or audit their compliance with your opt out request because we do not have access to their data processing systems.\n</p>\n<p> Our advertising partners will also be allowed to set or recognize a cookie on your browser only to provide services to us.\nThis means that the personal information tied to your browser may still be used by our advertising partners to help us perform advertising-related functions such as measuring, reporting and optimizing the effectiveness of our ads, capping how many times you may see an ad, counting ad impressions and user actions taken after clicking on an ad, ensuring services are working correctly and securely, providing aggregate statistics and analytics, or reducing ad fraud.\n</p>\n<p>Please note that opting-out does not mean that you will stop seeing <strong>ads or that you will stop seeing interest-based ads</strong>, as some of our advertising partners may still target ads to you based on information they collected about you prior to you opting out.\nIn addition, If you would like more information about how to opt out from interest based advertising from multiple websites and services, please visit http://optout.aboutads.info/#/ and http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#.\nYou may also download the AppChoices app at http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out in mobile apps.\nNote also that one of our partners, LiveRamp, requires a separate opt out of selling information at https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out.\n</p>\n<p>We manage your Opt Out status via your Browser ID cookie which applies to this Site only (see chart in Section 2 above).\nThis means that if you delete cookies from your browser or visit this Site from another browser or device, we will not recognize you as an Opted Out user.\nYou will need to click on the Opt Out button from those other devices or browsers to effect the Opt Out for those devices or browsers.\nSimilarly, if you visit another Ask Media Group Site, you will need to Opt Out via the Opt Out button located on the Privacy Policy page of that Site to effect the opt out for that Site.</p> 6) Your Access, Revision &amp.\nDeletion Rights <p>\n</p>\n<strong>Right to know/right of access</strong> If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in California, or in certain other states, you have specific rights to know and have access to the personal information that has been collected and stored by the web properties that you visit (and in the EEA, right to correct such information).\nYour rights can only be exercised if such web properties can adequately verify that you are the same person as the user whose data is being requested.\nAt Ask Media Group, we do not collect sufficient data to authenticate any particular user.\nAs indicated in Section 2 above, we only recognize a unique browser based on the Browser ID we assign to that browser for a particular Site.\nA Browser ID could therefore correspond to multiple individuals.\nIn the same way, one user could have multiple unique browser IDs if they visit multiple Sites or visit the same Sites with multiple devices or browsers.\nSince the personal information we collect related to a Browser ID is not sufficient to verify that the corresponding browser belongs to the person making the request, we are not able to provide any information in response to any request to know or access specific personal information about a user.\nThis is to prevent anyone from using your browser to obtain your search or browsing history.\nWe want to make sure your search and browsing history does not fall into the wrong hands.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>However, upon your request, and provided you are able to provide to us your Browser ID, then we may provide you with the following information collected within the last 12 months: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which categories of personal information we have collected about you (based on your Browser ID or other information you have provided to us), and how we collected that information, as well as the business or commercial purposes for our collecting such personal information.\n</li>\n<li>A list of the categories of personal information shared with third parties for a business purpose and the categories of third parties to whom we have shared your personal information.\n</li>\n<li>A list of categories of personal information that may have been collected by third parties when you visited our Site, and the categories of third parties who may have collected such information.\n</li>\n</ul> Information relating to your Browser ID is retained by us for various time periods, so we may not be able to provide information for the full 12 months preceding your request.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>Please note that if you have provided to us your email address to subscribe to one of our newsletters, your email is not automatically tied to your Browser ID, and therefore you have to request us to delete your email separately.\nIf you have submitted a HelpDesk request, or have submitted a job application with us, your contact information will not be tied to your Browser ID and we will not be able to verify that any Browser ID information corresponds to any additional information you provide to us.\nSee below for email deletion requests.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Right to delete</strong> If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in California, or in certain other states, you have specific rights to request us to delete any personal information we have stored about you.\nIn the EEA, you also have the right to withdraw any consent that you have previously provided to us to store or use your personal information.\nAs indicated above, since all personal information we have is tied to your Browser ID, we are only able to delete your personal information from our databases if you can provide to us that Browser ID.\nYou can also request deletion of certain other information that is not tied to your Browser ID as further described below.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Process to submit a right to know/right of access or right to delete request</strong> To request us to access personal information categories or delete personal information we have collected with respect to your Browser ID, please follow these steps: <ol>\n<li>Click on the Browser ID button below to get your Browser ID and copy your Browser ID to a safe place so you can later send it to us.\nRemember that this Browser ID is unique to this website.\nIf you visit a different Site with the same browser, you will be identified as a different user with a different Browser ID.\n</li> Browser ID 3BF1120D-8308-4317-8038-805FDEED4929 <li> Contact us via our HelpDesk, click the \u201cContact Us\u201d button, then fill out the form.\nSelect \u201cRequest access to or deletion of your personal data\u201d in the drop-down for the Subject field.\n</li>\n<li>Provide your Browser ID number</li>\n<li>Provide a written and signed statement confirming that: <ol>\n<li>You are a resident of California, or a country in the EEA (please indicate which country) or another state where the laws provide you similar rights (please indicate which state)</li>\n<li>You are the rightful owner of the browser that corresponds to the Browser ID you are providing.\nand </li>\n<li>you are the sole user of that browser and no other individual has used the browser</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Clarify whether you are requesting us to (a) delete all of the personal information tied to your Browser ID.\nor (b) send to you information on the categories of personal data we have collected and shared that are tied to your Browser ID.</li>\n<li>To assist us in processing your request in a timely manner, please make your request in English if you are able to do so.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>We manage requests to delete or access personal information on a per Browser ID basis, which is the only way we have of recognizing or authenticating a user.\nEven if you have created an account with us and submitted your email address, we may not automatically tie your email address to your browser ID.\nThis means that we need access to your browser when you click on the Browser ID button above and will process your request based on that Browser ID.\nWe therefore cannot process any request from a third party acting as your agent.\nFor email deletion requests, see below.\n</p>\n<p>All requests for access or deletion will be reviewed by our legal and compliance team and we reserve the right, in compliance with applicable laws, to accept or reject, or make further inquiries regarding, any requests.\nWe try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.\nOccasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests.\nIn this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.\nWe will typically not charge a fee to fully respond to your requests.\nprovided, however, that we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act upon a request, if it is excessive, repetitive, unfounded or overly burdensome.\nIf we determine that the request warrants a fee, or that we may refuse it, we will give you notice explaining why we made that decision.\nYou will be provided a cost estimate and the opportunity to accept such fees before we will charge you for responding to your request.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Unsubscribe and deletion of email information </strong> To stop receiving email communications from us, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the email you receive, or by contacting us via our HelpDesk and requesting us to no longer receive emails from us.\nNote that regardless of your email preference settings, we may send you transactional and administrative messages regarding our Sites and services.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>If you have provided your email address to us by subscribing to one of our Sites\u2019 newsletters or other email communications, you may request us to remove your email from our database by contacting us via our HelpDesk.\nNote that your email is not automatically tied to your Browser ID and so deleting your email will not automatically delete from our systems all personal information we have relating to your activities on our Sites.\nSee Section 2 for more details on Browser ID related personal information.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Deletion of information you submit via our HelpDesk</strong> You may request us to delete all the information you submitted to us via our HelpDesk by contacting us via our HelpDesk.\nHowever, we reserve the right to retain any information you provided via our HelpDesk in order to defend legal claims, retain a record of our compliance with laws, including privacy and data protection laws, and other statutory data retention requirements.\nNote that except when you provide your Browser ID via a HelpDesk request, your HelpDesk request information is not tied to your Browser ID.\nDeleting your HelpDesk request information will not automatically delete from our systems all personal information we have relating to your activities on our Sites and you must make these requests separately.\nSee Section 2 for more details on Browser ID related personal information.\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<strong>Deletion of information you submit in response to a job posting</strong> You may request us to delete all the information you submitted to us in response to a job posting by contacting us via our HelpDesk.\nHowever, we reserve the right to retain any information you provided to us to apply for a position at Ask Media Group in order to defend legal claims, retain a record of our compliance with laws, and other statutory data retention requirements.\nNote that your job application information is not tied to your Browser ID and so deleting your job application information will not automatically delete from our systems all personal information we have relating to your activities on our Sites.\nSee Section 2 for more details on Browser ID-related personal information.\n<p>\n</p> 7) Data Hosted in the United States\n<p> Ask Media Group is headquartered in California, and in order to access our Sites, your browser interacts directly with our Site servers in the United States.\nBy visiting or using our Sites, your data is automatically collected, processed and stored on servers located in the United States.\nIf you are located in the United Kingdom (\u201cUK\u201d), Switzerland, or the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), this means your data is stored in a country the laws of which may offer less personal data protection than your country.\nWe however comply with requirements set forth in the EU General Data Protection Regulation when we process your data, and you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data supervisory authority of your country if you feel that we have unlawfully processed your data.\n</p>\n<p>Your personal data is also processed in the United States by some of the third parties with whom we share your data, as detailed in the chart in the Information We Collect, How We Use It, and How and Why We Share It Section above and in the Additional information about Sharing with Third Parties section above.\nWe have entered into data processing agreements with service providers who process your data that restrict and regulate their processing of your data on our behalf.\n</p>\n<p> If you are in the UK, Switzerland, or the EEA and you do not consent to your data being processed by us or by our service providers in the United States, please follow the steps outlined in the Right to delete section above and contact us via our HelpDesk, and please stop accessing our Sites.\n</p> 8) Non Discrimination, Complaints and Disputes\n<p> All content and services offered on the Sites are free of charge and Ask Media Group will not discriminate against any user who has exercised their rights as set forth in this privacy policy.\n</p>\n<p> We commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.\nInquiries, concerns or complaints may be submitted to us here.\n</p>\n<p> We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution of any complaint or concern about your privacy.\nIf, however, you believe that we have not satisfactorily addressed your complaint or concern, you may have the right to make a complaint to the data protection authority of your state of residence.\nAMG is further subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in the United States.\n</p> 9) Data Retention and Security\n<p>We have designed our Browser ID system so that we can manage our Sites while collecting as little information about our users as possible.\nWe retain the information tied to your Browser ID for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose we collected it for and for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.\nTo determine the appropriate retention period for personal information we process, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your information, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>\n<p>If you subscribe to one of our Sites\u2019 email communications and provide us your email address, we will keep your email address for as long as you open our email communications and six months after your email address becomes unresponsive to our emails or when you unsubscribe.</p>\n<p>We retain information in our HelpDesk system for up to three years to respond to discovery requests in the event of litigation or have the ability to defend legal claims.\n</p>\n<p>We retain information you provide to apply for jobs at Ask Media group for as long as we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to contact you if we have a job opening that fits your qualification, or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements) after which our service provider Greenhouse will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then they will securely store your information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>\n<p>We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.\nWe also limit access to information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs.\nHowever, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.\n</p> 10) Updates to this Privacy Policy and Contact Information\n<p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, applicable laws, business practices, and our user\u2019s needs, and may make changes accordingly.\nPlease check this page periodically for updates.\nIf we make any material changes, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page, along with its effective date, and notify you by means of a notice on the Sites.\nExcept in connection with updates that materially change the ways in which we process your information, your continued use of the Services after this Privacy Policy has been updated means that you agree to be bound by such updates.\nWe will provide notice in advance of the effective date with regard to any updates that materially change the ways in which we process your personal information.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the manner in which your information is processed (or if you are an EEA resident, how your data is transferred outside of the EEA), or if you would like to submit a request to us, please contact our Data Protection Officer here or via mail at: </p> Ask Media Group, LLC<br> Data Protection Officer<br> 1955 Broadway, Suite 350<br> Oakland, CA 94612 <p>\n</p> ", "created_at":
