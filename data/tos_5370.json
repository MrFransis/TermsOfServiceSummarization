efforts to encrypt sensitive data such as credit card number and personal health data.\nWe use certain reasonable security measures to help protect your personal information.\nHowever, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.\nPlease note that we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.\nYou use the Site and

Information.\nThe CCPA defines \"<b>Personal Information</b>\" as \"information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\" This section describes (i) the categories and sources of Personal Information that QuinStreet collects, sells or shares.\n(ii) the purpose for collection.\n(iii) the types of third parties to whom QuinStreet discloses that information.\nand (iv) details about how California residents can exercise their rights under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>Categories of Data QuinStreet Collects in the Preceding 12 Months.\nQuinStreet collects the following CCPA categories of data: (i) <b>identifiers</b>, such as a name, email address, telephone number, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, IP address, account name, Social Security number, driver's license number.\n(ii) <b>personal identifiers under Cal.\nCiv.\nCode \u00c2\u00a7 1798.80(e)</b>, such as insurance policy number, education, employment status, bank account information, credit card or debit card number, financial information, medical

Provided Attributes.\nQuinStreet receives each of those categories of data only as self-reported data from the consumer.</p>\n<p>Sources of Data QuinStreet Collects.\n<i>QuinStreet: </i>QuinStreet collects Technical Data and Provided Attributes from consumers who visit or engage with our Sites, our call centers or other QuinStreet owned-properties (e.g., in response to emails from or on behalf of QuinStreet).</p>\n<p>\n<i>Partners and Third Parties: </i>Consumers who visit websites our Media Partners own may be redirected to our Sites.\nIn some cases, we may gather data directly from Media Partner websites, or Media Partners or other third parties may post data to our Sites or otherwise transfer data to us.\nThis may occur via display ads, click listings, inquiry forms or telephonic transfers from Media Partner call centers.\nOur Advertising Partners may also provide us with data.</p>\n<p>\n<i>Service Providers: </i>QuinStreet engages service providers to perform a variety of functions (e.g., verifying consumer consent, validating email addresses or phone numbers).</p>\n<p>\n<i>Authorization: </i>We require all parties from whom we receive Personal Information, whether they are Partners, service providers or other third parties, to represent and warrant to us that they have appropriately obtained the Personal Information provided to us and have the authority to share the Personal Information with us.</p>\n<p>Purpose for Personal Information Collection.\nAs described above in \"<b>Data Use</b>\", QuinStreet primarily uses the Personal Information it collects to connect consumers with Advertising Partners who can provide information about the products and services those consumers are seeking.</p>\n<p>Categories of Third Parties with Whom QuinStreet Has Disclosed Personal Information in the Preceding 12 Months.\nIn addition to sharing data for the primary use described in \"<b>Data Sharing</b>\", we may share identifiers and internet activity (e.g., name, email address, telephone number, browsing history) with other QuinStreet businesses, service providers, and third party websites.</p>\n<p>QuinStreet may also disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third Party Data to other QuinStreet businesses or with a third party in the event of a sale or transfer of all or part of our business.</p>\n<p>Additionally, QuinStreet may disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes, and Third Party Data (e.g., identifiers, personal identifiers, protected classification information, geolocation data, and inferences) with service providers who assist us in compliance and verification activities (e.g., credit agencies), or provide services such as payment processing, IT, and data analysis information.</p>\n<p>Categories of Personal Information Disclosed or Sold.\nAs described above in \"<b>Data Use</b>\" and \"<b>Data Sharing</b>\", QuinStreet may disclose or sell Technical Data, Provided Attributes and Third Party Data, including identifiers, internet activity, personal identifiers, and protected classification characteristics (e.g., name, email address, telephone number, browsing history, education, credit information, veteran or military status, browsing history, geolocation data) to Advertising Partners who can provide the consumer with information about the products and services they are seeking.\nWe may receive a fee for the transfer of that data or when the consumer purchases a product or service.\nQuinStreet does not knowingly collect, disclose, or sell personal information from individuals under the age of 16.</p>\n<p>CCPA Rights.\nThe CCPA affords certain rights and protections to California residents including: (i) the right to request that we delete any \"Personal Information\" that we have collected from you (\"<b>Right to Delete</b>\").\n(ii) the right to request that we disclose the categories and/or specific pieces of \"Personal Information\" collected, used, disclosed, and sold (\"<b>Right to Know</b>\").\nand (iii) the right to direct us not to sell your \"Personal Information\" (\"Right to Opt-Out\").</p>\n<p>California residents who would like to submit a Request to Know, Delete, or Opt-Out should follow the links below.</p>\n<p>Request to Know</p>\n<p>Request to Delete</p>\n<p>Request to Opt-Out (\"Do Not Sell My Personal Info\")</p>\n<p>You may also submit a Request to Know or Request to Delete by calling our toll-free number (844)-872-7854.</p>\n<p>Upon submission of a request, you will be asked to validate your email address and create an account with QuinStreet's privacy vendor.\nQuinStreet will respond within 45 days of your submission (or such additional time period as the law allows).</p>\n<p>Verifying Your Identity.\nBecause of the nature of our Sites, QuinStreet is not able to definitely verify your identity prior to responding to your Request to Know or Delete.\nConsumers who interact with our Sites are not required to set up an account, to register, or to validate their Personal Information and QuinStreet does not maintain an ongoing relationship with consumers who provide their Personal Information.\nBecause of these factors, QuinStreet is not able to reasonably verify the identity of any consumer based on the information provided through our Sites and through a submitted request.\nTherefore, QuinStreet cannot honor Requests to Know.\nInstead, QuinStreet can provide in response to such requests a description of QuinStreet's business practices regarding its handling of Personal Information, including a description of the categories of Personal Information collected, maintained, and sold.</p>\n<p>As a California consumer, you have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by QuinStreet for the exercise of your privacy rights under the CCPA.</p>\n<p>If you provide authority to another person to submit a request on your behalf, or are a person submitting a request on behalf of another person, please select \"on behalf of another person\" on the form linked above.\nQuinStreet will review the request and may contact you for additional information to validate your identity, to show proper authorization to make a request on behalf of another, and/or to confirm that the authorized agent is properly registered with the Secretary of State to do business in California.</p>Changes to this Privacy Notice<p>We may amend this Privacy Notice from time to time.\nWhen we do, we will post an updated version of the Privacy Notice and revise the \"<b>LAST UPDATED</b>\" date at the top.\nWe will provide appropriate notice to you if we change the Privacy Notice in any material way.\nUsing this Site after we make any changes means you accept those changes and the revised Privacy Notice.</p>QuinStreet Businesses<p>For purposes of this Privacy Notice, \"<b>you</b>\" or \"<b>your</b>\" means the person(s) using this Site or the products or services offered through this
