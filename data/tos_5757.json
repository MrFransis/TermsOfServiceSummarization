<p>Last modified: July 19, 2019.</p>\n<p> We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise.\nData protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of the PreMiD.\nThe use of the Internet pages of the PreMiD is possible without any indication of personal data.\nhowever, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we generally obtain consent from the data subject.\n</p>\n<p> The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the PreMiD.\nBy means of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process.\nFurthermore, data subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.\n</p>\n<p> As the controller, the PreMiD has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website.\nHowever, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed.\nFor this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g.\nby telephone.\n</p> 1.\nDefinitions <p> The data protection declaration of the PreMiD is based on the terms used by the European legislator for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\nOur data protection declaration should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business partners.\nTo ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.\n</p>\n<p> In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a) Personal data <p> Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u201cdata subject\u201d).\nAn identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>b) Data subject <p> Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed by the controller responsible for the processing.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>c) Processing <p> Processing is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>d) Restriction of processing <p> Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>e) Profiling <p> Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>f) Pseudonymisation <p> Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>g) Controller or controller responsible for the processing <p> Controller or controller responsible for the processing is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.\nwhere the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>h) Processor <p> Processor is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>i) Recipient <p> Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not.\nHowever, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients.\nthe processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>j) Third party <p> Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>k) Consent <p> Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 2.\nName and Address of the controller <p> Controller for the purposes of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), other data protection laws applicable in Member states of the European Union and other provisions related to data protection is: </p>\n<p>PreMiD</p>\n<p>Germany</p>\n<p>Email: contact@premid.app</p>\n<p> Website: https://premid.app</p> 3.\nCookies <p> The Internet pages of the PreMiD use cookies.\nCookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser.\n</p>\n<p> Many Internet sites and servers use cookies.\nMany cookies contain a so-called cookie ID.\nA cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie.\nIt consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored.\nThis allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies.\nA specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.\n</p>\n<p> Through the use of cookies, the PreMiD can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.\n</p>\n<p> By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.\nCookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users.\nThe purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our website.\nThe website user that uses cookies, e.g.\ndoes not have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.\nAnother example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop.\nThe online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.\n</p>\n<p> The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nFurthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs.\nThis is possible in all popular Internet browsers.\nIf the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website may be entirely usable.\n</p>\n<p> You can see our Cookie Policy here: https://premid.app/cookies</p> 4.\nCollection of general data and information <p> The website of the PreMiD collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or automated system calls up the website.\nThis general data and information are stored in the server log files.\nCollected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on our information technology systems.\n</p>\n<p> When using these general data and information, the PreMiD does not draw any conclusions about the data subject.\nRather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a cyber-attack.\nTherefore, the PreMiD analyzes anonymously collected data and information statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise, and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process.\nThe anonymous data of the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.\n</p> 5.\nRoutine erasure and blocking of personal data <p> The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.\n</p>\n<p> If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.\n</p> 6.\nRights of the data subject <ul>\n<li>a) Right of confirmation <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed.\nIf a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of confirmation, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>b) Right of access <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller free information about his or her personal data stored at any time and a copy of this information.\nFurthermore, the European directives and regulations grant the data subject access to the following information: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>the purposes of the processing;</li>\n<li>the categories of personal data concerned;</li>\n<li> the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations.\n</li>\n<li> where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.\n</li>\n<li> the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data, or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject, or to object to such processing.\n</li>\n<li> the existence of the

existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation.\nWhere this is the case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.\n</p>\n<p> If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>c) Right to rectification <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or her.\nTaking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.\n</p>\n<p> If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten) <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.\n</li>\n<li> The data subject withdraws consent to which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.\n</li>\n<li> The data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2) of the GDPR.\n</li>\n<li>The personal data have been unlawfully processed.</li>\n<li> The personal data must be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.\n</li>\n<li> The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) of the GDPR.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, and a data subject wishes to request the erasure of personal data stored by the PreMiD, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the controller.\nAn employee of PreMiD shall promptly ensure that the erasure request is complied with immediately.\n</p>\n<p> Where the controller has made personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Article 17(1) to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform other controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data, as far as processing is not required.\nAn employees of the PreMiD will arrange the necessary measures in individual cases.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>e) Right of restriction of processing <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data.\n</li>\n<li> The processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests instead the restriction of their use instead.\n</li>\n<li> The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n</li>\n<li> The data subject has objected to processing pursuant to Article 21(1) of the GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p> If one of the aforementioned conditions is met, and a data subject wishes to request the restriction of the processing of personal data stored by the PreMiD, he or she may at any time contact any employee of the controller.\nThe employee of the PreMiD will arrange the restriction of the processing.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>f) Right to data portability <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator, to receive the personal data concerning him or her, which was provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.\nHe or she shall have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, as long as the processing is based on consent pursuant to point (a) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR or point (a) of Article 9(2) of the GDPR, or on a contract pursuant to point (b) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.\n</p>\n<p> Furthermore, in exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to Article 20(1) of the GDPR, the data subject shall have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.\n</p>\n<p> In order to assert the right to data portability, the data subject may at any time contact any employee of the PreMiD.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>g) Right to object <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.\nThis also applies to profiling based on these provisions.\n</p>\n<p> The PreMiD shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n</p>\n<p> If the PreMiD processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing.\nThis applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\nIf the data subject objects to the PreMiD to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the PreMiD will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.\n</p>\n<p> In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the PreMiD for scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.\n</p>\n<p> In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the PreMiD.\nIn addition, the data subject is free in the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or (3) is not based on the data subject's explicit consent.\n</p>\n<p> If the decision (1) is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller, or (2) it is based on the data subject's explicit consent, the PreMiD shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and contest the decision.\n</p>\n<p> If the data subject wishes to exercise the rights concerning automated individual decision-making, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the PreMiD.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>i) Right to withdraw data protection consent <p> Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to withdraw his or her consent to processing of his or her personal data at any time.\n</p>\n<p> If the data subject wishes to exercise the right to withdraw the consent, he or she may, at any time, contact any employee of the PreMiD.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> 7.\nData protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization function) <p> On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer function).\nGoogle Analytics is a web analytics service.\nWeb analytics is the collection, gathering, and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites.\nA web analysis service collects, inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed.\nWeb analytics are mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising.\n</p>\n<p> The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.\n</p>\n<p> For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application \"_gat.\n_anonymizeIp\".\nBy means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\n</p>\n<p> The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website.\nGoogle uses the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning the use of our Internet site for us.\n</p>\n<p> Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nThe definition of cookies is explained above.\nWith the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to analyze the use of our website.\nWith each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google.\nDuring the course of this technical procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks, and subsequently create commission settlements.\n</p>\n<p> The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject.\nWith each visit to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America.\nThese personal data are stored by Google in the United States of America.\nGoogle may pass these personal data collected through the technical procedure to third parties.\n</p>\n<p> The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.\nSuch an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject.\nIn addition, cookies already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software programs.\n</p>\n<p> In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such.\nFor this purpose, the data subject must download a browser add-on from this page and install it.\nThis browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics.\nThe installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google.\nIf the information technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics.\nIf the browser add-on was uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the browser add-ons.\n</p>\n<p> Further information and the applicable data protection provisions of Google may be retrieved under this page and under this page.\nGoogle Analytics is further explained on this page.\n</p> 8.\nLegal basis for the processing <p> Art.\n6(1) lit.\na GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.\nIf the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the processing is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nb GDPR.\nThe same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services.\nIs our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nc GDPR.\nIn rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.\nThis would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other third party.\nThen the processing would be based on Art.\n6(1) lit.\nd GDPR.\nFinally, processing operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR.\nThis legal basis is used for processing operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.\nSuch processing operations are particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.\nHe considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).\n</p> 9.\nThe legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party <p> Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit.\nf GDPR our legitimate interest is to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.\n</p> 10.\nPeriod for which the personal data will be stored <p> The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory retention period.\nAfter expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a contract.\n</p> 11.\nProvision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement.\nRequirement necessary to enter into a contract.\nObligation of the data subject to provide the personal data.\npossible consequences of failure to provide such data <p> We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g.\ntax regulations) or can also result from contractual provisions (e.g.\ninformation on the contractual partner).\nSometimes it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data, which must subsequently be processed by us.\nThe data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her.\nThe non-provision of the personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be concluded.\nBefore personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any employee.\nThe employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.\n</p> 12.\nExistence of automated decision-making <p> As a responsible company, we do not use automatic decision-making or profiling.\n</p>\n<p> This Privacy Policy has been generated by the
