Privacy Policy <p>Your privacy is critically important to us.\nAt Home Assistant, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don\u2019t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.\n(We can\u2019t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>\n<li>We don\u2019t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p> Website Visitors\n<p>Like most website operators, Home Assistant collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.\nHome Assistant uses the Google Analytics service for this.\nHome Assistant\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Home Assistant\u2019s visitors use its website.\nFrom time to time, Home Assistant may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>\n<p>Home Assistant also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the blog or forums.\nHome Assistant only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p> Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information\n<p>Certain visitors to Home Assistant\u2019s websites choose to interact with Home Assistant in ways that require Home Assistant to gather personally-identifying information.\nThe amount and type of information that Home Assistant gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.\nFor example, we ask visitors who create a forum account to provide a username and an email address.\nThose who engage in transactions with Home Assistant are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.\nIn each case, Home Assistant collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor\u2019s interaction with Home Assistant.\nHome Assistant does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.\nAnd visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p> Aggregated Statistics\n<p>Home Assistant may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.\nFor instance, Home Assistant may monitor the most popular integration documentation.\nHome Assistant may display this information publicly or provide it to others.\nHowever, Home Assistant does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p> Information We Collect from Other Sources\n<p>With your authorization, we may also obtain information about you from other sources.\nFor example, if you create or log into your Home Assistant Community account through a social media service (like Facebook or Google) or if you connect your account to a social media service, we will receive information from that service (such as your username, basic profile information, and friends list) via the authorization procedures used by that service.\nThe information we receive depends on which services you authorize and any options that are available.</p> Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information\n<p>Home Assistant discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Home Assistant\u2019s behalf or to provide services available at Home Assistant\u2019s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.\nSome of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country.\nby using Home Assistant\u2019s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.\nHome Assistant will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.\nOther than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Home Assistant discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Home Assistant believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Home Assistant, third parties or the public at large.\nIf you are a registered user of an Home Assistant website and have supplied your email address, Home Assistant may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what\u2019s going on with Home Assistant and our products.\nWe primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum.\nIf you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.\nHome Assistant takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p> Cookies\n<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.\nHome Assistant uses cookies to help Home Assistant identify and track visitors, their usage of Home Assistant website, and their website access preferences.\nHome Assistant visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Home Assistant\u2019s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Home Assistant\u2019s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p> Business Transfers\n<p>If Home Assistant, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Home Assistant goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.\nYou acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Home Assistant may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p> Ads\n<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.\nThese cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer.\nThis information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.\nThis Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Home Assistant and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p> Companion Applications\n<p>All information collected by the applications is sent directly to your hosted instance of Home Assistant.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, sensor data and location data, which at times is sent while the application is in the background.\nAt no point is this data logged or given to a 3rd party.</p> Privacy Policy Changes\n<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Home Assistant may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Home Assistant\u2019s sole discretion.\nHome Assistant encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.\nYour continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p> Change log\n<ul>\n<li>October 19, 2017: Initial version</li>\n<li>October 19, 2020: Add information about Companion Applications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<em>This privacy policy has been adapted from the Automattic privacy policy and is licensed Creative Commons ShareAlike.</em>\n</p>\n<b> Help
