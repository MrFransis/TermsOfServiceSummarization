database of&nbsp;company reviews, CEO approval ratings,&nbsp;salary reports,&nbsp;interview reviews&nbsp;and questions, benefits reviews, office photos and more.\nUnlike other job sites, all of this information is shared by those who know a company best \u2014 the employees.\nIn turn, job seekers on Glassdoor are well-researched and more informed about the jobs and companies they apply to and consider joining.\nThis is why thousands of employers across all industries and sizes turn to Glassdoor to help them&nbsp;recruit and hire quality candidates&nbsp;at scale who stay longer.\nGlassdoor is available anywhere via its&nbsp;mobile apps.</p> Glassdoor Privacy and Cookie Policy <p>\n<strong>Revised September 3, 2020.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We, Glassdoor, explain in this Privacy and Cookie Policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) how we collect, process and/or use information that we receive via our websites, emails we send, and mobile applications (collectively, the \u201cPlatform\u201d) that link to this Policy, as amended from time to time.\nThis Policy describes how Glassdoor collects, processes, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide.\nIt also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information.\nFor purposes of this Policy, personal information shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>\n<p>Unless we specify otherwise, this Policy applies only to information we collect, process and use through the Platform.\nThis Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us, unless we notify you at the time of collection that this privacy policy applies.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Policy, \u201cGlassdoor,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d shall mean the following entities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Glassdoor, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 100 Shoreline Highway, Mill Valley California, USA.</li>\n</ul> Information We Collect <p>We collect information about you to provide our services.\nIn order for us to best provide our services to you (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy.\nIf you are a registered user of the Platform the data collection is largely necessary for fulfilling our contractual obligations towards you and, where neither of those is the case, alternative legal grounds serve as our legal basis for processing (i.e., consent, legal obligation, and legitimate interests\u2014see details below).</p> Information You Give Us <p>When you fill out registration forms, submit your resume, or provide us with other personal information actively, we collect that information for processing and use in accordance with this Policy.\nBecause we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you will have the opportunity to provide personal information to us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating an account</li>\n<li>Signing up for email alerts</li>\n<li>Completing a form related to one of our products or services</li>\n<li>Uploading a CV</li>\n<li>Completing your Profile or preferences</li>\n<li>Sending messages through Glassdoor</li>\n<li>Contacting us for technical support or customer service.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on how you interact with our Platform, the personal information we collect from you may vary.\nFor example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password.\nIn other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address.\nWe also collect and store certain information associated with actions you take.\nFor example, when you search for jobs, we store the titles, locations and general salary range (if available) of jobs you search for and click on.\nWe also store information about the job postings that you apply to, the time and duration of your activity on our Platform, and other information about your behavior on our Platform.\nBecause much of this information is necessary for us to provide you with our service, if you don\u2019t share this information you may not be able to use some features of the Glassdoor platform.</p>\n<p>If you connect to the Platform using Facebook, Google+, or another social networking site (each a \u201cSocial Networking Site\u201d), we will receive information that you authorize the Social Networking Site to share with us, which may include public profile information, birthday, current city work, school, and email address.\nWhen we receive this information, it becomes Glassdoor account information for purposes of your use of the Platform.\nThis information also constitutes personal information and is therefore subject to this Policy.\nAny information that we collect from your Social Networking Site account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site, so please consult the Social Networking Site\u2019s privacy and data practices.\nYou have the ability to disconnect your Social Networking Site account from your Glassdoor account by adapting the privacy settings in your Social Networking Site account.\nIf you come to the Platform through a Social Networking Site, from other websites or with devices that enable third parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.</p>\n<p>On certain Glassdoor domains, when you set up an individual user account on the Platform, you may create a profile (a \u201cProfile\u201d) that will include personal information you provide.\nAt your request, we will create your Profile with information we extract from a resume you have uploaded on the Platform.\nWhen you fill out and save your Profile, your saved Profile can be viewed by prospective employers, subject to visibility settings you control.\n(For example, when you apply to certain Easy Apply jobs posted by a Glassdoor employer client, we may share a static image of your saved Profile with that employer in connection with your application).\nBecause your anonymity on our Platform is important, your Profile does not include information you submit to the Platform anonymously (for example, the reviews, salaries, benefits, and company ratings information you submit anonymously).</p>\n<p>We may host an Easy Apply application that asks for relevant information generally considered sensitive (such as a driver\u2019s license number for truck driver job, or a government-issued identification number for a government job).\nSome applications may ask you to identify your racial/ethnic origin or disabilities on a strictly voluntary basis (e.g.\nfor purposes of providing equal employment opportunities) and you may choose not to submit this information without any detriment to your application.\nFor our EU users, data about racial/ethnic origin and disabilities are considered special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d).\nWhen we host Easy Apply applications that collect this kind of data, we pass that information along to the employer when we submit your application and do not retain it on our systems.\nBut please remember, you should not include this kind of data in any resume you upload to the Platform or submit it in any other scenarios, except where we specifically prompt you to provide such information such as described above.</p>\n<p>Some of our Easy Apply applications allow you to apply to a job hosted on the site of one of our affiliates.\nWhen you click on the Easy Apply button, and confirm by clicking the Apply button, your application will be submitted for the job through one of our affiliates.\nBefore the Apply button, you will see a notice informing you that the application is hosted on an affiliate\u2019s site, including a link in the affiliate\u2019s terms and privacy policy.\nYou will have the opportunity to open the affiliate\u2019s terms and privacy policy and read them prior to submitting your application.</p>\n<p>Glassdoor provides the Glassdoor Messaging Service, a two-way message proxy and relay system.\nBy utilizing the Glassdoor Messaging Service, you acknowledge that you are asking Glassdoor to send these messages on your behalf.\nThis includes your resumes, cover letters, applications, messages, questionnaire answers, responses, offer letters and other materials.\nWhen you ask Glassdoor to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an employer via Glassdoor or the Glassdoor Messaging Service or store such application, you understand Glassdoor reserves the right to reformat such application or message.</p>\n<p>We process, monitor, review, store and analyze such content and other materials, including via automated means, for data analysis, quality control, enforcement of our Terms, and improvement of our services.\nExamples of such improvements would be optimizing our search results, improving job postings, matching you with a job posting or employer, ensuring you are provided with personally relevant product features and communications, and preventing fraud and spam.\nAs a result of this activity, or due to technical malfunction, in certain circumstances such content may be delayed or may not be delivered to the intended recipient.\nGlassdoor may (but is not obligated to) notify you in such an event.\nBy using Glassdoor Messaging Service or otherwise providing user content through Glassdoor, you acknowledge that this activity is necessary for maintaining the quality of Glassdoor and for providing the Glassdoor Messaging Service.\nPlease also note that since the Glassdoor Messaging Services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those email service providers.</p>\n<p>If you enter credit card information on the Platform in connection with a purchase, that information is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not store it on our servers.\nThe service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>\n<p>When you submit personal information to a third party and are informed at the time of collection that your information may be shared with us, we may collect that information for lawful marketing purposes.</p>\n<p>Employers with Free Employer Accounts may provide us with work email addresses of their employees for use to send an email asking those employees to leave candid reviews of the employer on the Platform.</p>\n<p>Categories of personal information collected by Glassdoor may include Job Postings (your job postings on Glassdoor), Profile Information (Name, Email Address, Resume, Current Job Title, Past Job History, Age, Gender), Sales &amp.\nSupport History (Purchase History, Payment Details, and other sales support interactions), Job Applications (jobs you have applied to), Job Interests &amp.\nActivity (job preferences and your activity interacting with jobs, e.g.\nsaving a job), Security &amp.\nLogin Information (Your login events, password changes, email changes and mobile device information), Site Activity (Pages you viewed and \u201clike activity\u201d), Marketing Activity (Marketing programs you have joined, content downloaded, etc.), User Feedback (Feedback you have provided Glassdoor via email, app/website and other channels), and/or Content You Contributed (Employer reviews, Salary Reports, Benefit reviews, Interview reviews, Employer photos).\nWe may also collect Additional Personal and Demographic Information you may elect to give us, as set forth in further detail below.</p> Information We Collect Automatically <p>When you use the Platform, your device is automatically providing information to us so we can respond and customize our response to you.\nThe type of information we collect by automated means generally includes technical information about your computer, such as your IP address or other device identifier, the type of device you use, and operating system version.\nThe information we collect also may include usage information and statistics about your interaction with the Platform.\nThat information may include the URLs of our web pages that you visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, location data (if you have enabled access to your location on your mobile device), and other information about how you used the Platform.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Automated means of data collection include the following:</em>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies And Tracking Technologies.</strong> Technologies such as: cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called \u201cflash cookies\u201d), mobile identifiers and similar technologies (\u201cCookies\u201d) are used by Glassdoor and our partners (such as advertising, marketing and analytics providers) (\u201cAd Partners\u201d).\nWe use Cookies to remember users\u2019 settings as well as for authentication and analytics.\nThese technologies may be used in analyzing trends, administering the Platform, tracking users\u2019 movements around the Platform and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.\nOur Ad Partners may also use such technologies to deliver advertisements to you.\nYou can control the use of Cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable Cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.\nFor more information on Cookies, how we use them, the third parties we work with who use them, and how you can control them, please see the section of this policy entitled Cookie Policy and Ad Choices.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Log File Information.</strong> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile application each time you access a website on our Platform.\nFor example, when you access a Glassdoor website, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends when you visit any website.\nThese server logs include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, and pages viewed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the device you use to access the Platform, including type of device, operating system, settings, and unique device identifiers, and IP address.\nWhether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you\u2019re using and its settings.\nFor example, different types of information are available depending on whether you\u2019re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or Android phone.\nWe collect the device type and any other information you choose to provide, such as username, geolocation, or email address.\nWe also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.\nThis software records information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.\nWe do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p> How We Use Information <p>We use the information we collect to provide our services.\nIn order for us to best provide our services (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Glassdoor\u2019s mission is to help people everywhere find a job and company they love.\nSince each of our affiliates shares a similar goal of helping people find jobs and helping employers hire quality candidates, Glassdoor and its affiliates have developed the HR Tech Privacy Center.\nThe HR Tech Privacy Center is designed to educate our users about our affiliates and how we share data with them to provide robust service offerings to our users.&nbsp.\nWe encourage you to visit the HR Tech Privacy Center to learn more.\nExamples of our affiliates include: Indeed, Simply Hired, Syft, Resume.com, Workopolis, Wowjobs, Engineerjobs, RescueMyResumes and Resumeperfector.</p>\n<p>As a registered user of our Platform, Glassdoor processes your information in accordance with our contractual obligations based on the Terms of Use and, where this is not the case, alternative legal grounds serve as our legal basis for processing (i.e., consent, legal obligation, and legitimate interests) including personal information for the following purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to provide you with personalized content, services and offers of services offered by Glassdoor, as well as other promotional content and services (for example, Glassdoor and its affiliates may use your previous search and browsing history (e.g.\nthe jobs you click on), or your resume, Profile, application information, and responses to screener questions to determine relevant search results and provide you with recommended jobs on Glassdoor or on sites of Glassdoor affiliates, or Glassdoor may reach out to you about jobs or companies you may be interested in.\nwe also use your IP address and mobile device for these purposes).\nFor the purposes of this Policy, \u201caffiliates\u201d means any entity that directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control of or with Glassdoor, Inc., now or in the future.\n\u201cControl\u201d for these purposes means having a majority of shares or the right and ability to direct

service-related purposes) on behalf of third parties through your Glassdoor account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you provide to us or (where it is lawful for us to do so) that we otherwise obtain from third-party resources;</li>\n<li>to permit Glassdoor or a Glassdoor affiliate to recommend a Glassdoor user (and that user\u2019s resume or resume extract) to an employer hosted by Glassdoor or to an employer hosted by a Glassdoor affiliate, subject to visibility settings you control (for example, Glassdoor may use application materials\u2014including resumes and responses to screener questions\u2014to determine whether the words of any job seeker\u2019s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a job posting or resume query, and vice-versa, we may then differentiate matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to employers as matches or not matches);</li>\n<li>to permit Glassdoor to contact Glassdoor users with respect to such recommendations, subject to visibility settings you control;</li>\n<li>to provide relevant advertising, including interest-based advertising from us and third parties, which may mean that we share non-personally identifiable information, such as your job title, to third-party

troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement (this includes use of your IP address and mobile device information to help diagnose problems with our service and to administer the Platform);</li>\n<li>to create aggregated statistical data that does not identify you individually and that we can commercialize (for example, we use mobile device data and IP addresses to create anonymized, aggregate demographic information);</li>\n<li>for other purposes that you separately authorise as you interact with Glassdoor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we collect any information that does not identify you as a specific natural person (\u201cNon-Personal Information\u201d), we are permitted to use and disclose this information for any purpose, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, except where we are required to do otherwise by applicable law.\nExamples of Non-Personal Information include: physical location information.\ndemographic information, including gender, dates of birth, ZIP codes, etc..\nor any personal information that has been anonymized, aggregated or de-identified.\nIf we combine any Non-Personal Information with your personal information (such as combining your ZIP code with your name), we will use and disclose such combined information as personal information in accordance with this policy.\nSimilarly, if applicable law requires that we treat certain Non-Personal Information as personal information, we will use and disclose this information as personal information in accordance with this policy.</p> How We Share Information/Recipients <p>We only disclose your personal information to third parties as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers all over the world to help us

any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Glassdoor.\nSuch affiliates shall process your personal data either (1) at our direction as a processor under a contractual relationship, (2) as a separate controller of your information where you are informed at the time of collection or processing of their relationship to you, or (3) where we believe it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest, and where such purposes are aligned with those for which you provided your personal data to us.\nThese instances and processing activities are outlined in the \u201cHow We Use Your Information\u201d section above and will include data falling into the categories described in the section \u201cInformation You Give Us\u201d.\nWe encourage you to visit the HR Tech Privacy Center to learn more.</li>\n<li>We will disclose data If we believe in good faith such disclosure is necessary (1) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants or legal process served on us (though we reserve the right to take action on behalf of our users to defend their right to anonymity when we believe there is a legitimate basis to do so, because candid, lawful, anonymous free speech is fundamental to Glassdoor\u2019s mission of workplace transparency).\n(2) to enforce our Glassdoor Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n(3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.\n(4) as we otherwise deem

you apply and any vendors they are working with to process your application;</li>\n<li>We invite you to include your resume or other information in more generally available formats for us to share with employers (for example, when you apply to Easy Apply jobs, a static image of your saved Profile), subject to visibility settings you control;</li>\n<li>We share certain information that does not identify you personally, but which is unique to your use of the Platform, such as job titles that you have entered at the time of registration or on your profile.\nWhen we share such information, we do not link job titles with your name when we provide this information to others, such as advertisers, recruiters or employers;</li>\n<li>We will otherwise share personal information with your consent.</li>\n<li>As described in this section, Glassdoor may share your data with our affiliates.\nWhen we share this data, this may be considered a \u201csale\u201d under applicable law.\nOnce we begin sharing data you will be able to opt-out of this sharing by accessing the link in our footer titled \u201cDo Not Sell My Info\u201d</li>\n</ul> The Legal Basis on Which Glassdoor Processes Your Personal Data <p>Glassdoor collects and processes your personal information on the basis of different legal grounds, depending on the nature of the personal information being provided and the type of processing involved.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Performance of a Contract</em>\n</p>\n<p>Most of the personal Data processed by Glassdoor is performed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of our agreements with you (among them, your agreement to our Terms of Use and this Policy), or in order to take steps at the request of the user prior to entering such an agreement.\nAn example of this would be where Glassdoor sends a job seeker\u2019s application to an employer.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Legitimate Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p>A second ground relied upon by Glassdoor for other types of processing of your personal information is that it is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by Glassdoor.\nSuch legitimate interests may include where Glassdoor sends you marketing about our products and services or where we believe you have a reasonable expectation that we will perform a particular type of processing on your behalf.\nA further example would be where Glassdoor shares your personal information with our affiliates as detailed in the \u201cHow We Share Information/Recipients\u201d section above.\nGlassdoor will only rely on such a ground where an assessment has been performed balancing the interests and rights involved and the necessity of the processing in order to provide our services, products and features to you.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Compliance with a Legal Obligation</em>\n</p>\n<p>A third ground relied upon for certain types of processing is that it is necessary in order to allow Glassdoor to comply with a legal obligation.\nAn example of this would be where Glassdoor is required to retain business records for fixed periods of time or transmit them to a user in order to comply with local legal requirements.\nAnother example is when Glassdoor collects Equal Employment Opportunity (or similar programs in your country) information on behalf of employers as part of the process of processing your applications to employers through the Glassdoor platform.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Consent</em>\n</p>\n<p>Finally, in certain limited situations, Glassdoor relies on your consent in order to process your personal information.\nWhere Glassdoor requires your consent in order to collect and process certain personal information, we seek your consent at the time of provision, and such processing will only be performed where consent is secured unless Glassdoor has another lawful basis on which to rely.\nFor example, your consent may be sought where you submit feedback to Glassdoor, or in certain instances where you initiate a marketing message or other communication with Glassdoor.\nYou can withdraw your consent, as detailed in the \u201cOther Important Privacy Information\u201d section below, where applicable.</p> Additional Personal and Demographic Information You May Elect to Give Us <p>At Glassdoor, our mission is to help everyone find a job and company they love.\nWe also believe transparency is one of the most powerful forces for good in the world.\nAt its core, transparency about the workplace empowers people with the right information to make the right decisions about their careers.\nIn an effort to innovate and evolve, and in order for us to take workplace transparency to the next level, you now have the option to provide us with personal diversity and inclusion (\u201cD&amp;I\u201d) information.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In particular, we may ask you to provide (and we may subsequently collect) certain categories of D&amp;I information about you, including information relating but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age</li>\n<li>Disability</li>\n<li>Gender Identity</li>\n<li>Language</li>\n<li>Leading Personality Trait</li>\n<li>Marital Status</li>\n<li>Parental Status</li>\n<li>Race &amp.\nEthnicity</li>\n<li>Religion&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Sexual Orientation</li>\n<li>Veteran Status</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>D&amp;I Information Principles</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We recognize that some of these categories of information are sensitive and very personal.\nWe therefore want to be fully transparent in how we collect and process this data so that you can make an informed decision whether or not you want to provide this information to us.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>First</strong>, you are <em>never</em> obligated to provide this information to access or use the Glassdoor platform.\nGlassdoor will always remain a place you can visit to find out information about companies and jobs without the need to supply personal information beyond your comfort level, i.e., the level at which you elect to share information about yourself (except as required in order to use a particular service, such as personal information necessary to apply for a job).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Second</strong>, we will only collect and process D&amp;I information based on your explicit consent.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Third</strong>, you will always have the option at any time to remove previously supplied D&amp;I information, or to update D&amp;I information that may have changed.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fourth</strong>, we employ physical, electronic, and managerial measures to safeguard the information we collect online.\nHowever, you should know that no company can fully eliminate security risks, so we cannot make guarantees about any part of our services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Fifth</strong>, we use D&amp;I data only for the purposes described in this Policy unless we notify you at the time of collection that we may use it in some other manner.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Sixth</strong>, we take precautions to ensure that your decision to provide your D&amp;I information does not inadvertently negate your anonymity or reveal your identity on our platform.\nFor example, we may limit the number of reviews or other pieces of content required with certain D&amp;I attributes for those D&amp;I attributes to become visible to the public in order to ensure that we do not inadvertently disclose sufficient information about a particular user\u2019s personal attributes that would make them identifiable.\nWhile we take your anonymity extremely seriously and make our best efforts to ensure that D&amp;I information does not inadvertently lead to your identification, there are two instances in which such disclosure of a user\u2019s identification may occur:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In order to provide a voice and agency to those who, regardless of the risks of identification, affirmatively wish to have their opinions and experiences heard, we may provide an option for users to opt into the disclosure of their D&amp;I data in a manner and to an extent that may lead to loss of their anonymity on our platform.\nThese choices will be conspicuously marked and will require affirmative assent to verify your understanding, intention, and acceptance of this risk of identification.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n<li>While we try very hard to plan for all contingencies, we are not perfect.\nThe preventative measures we take and our platform\u2019s technological performance may not always function the way we intend when combined with the complex realities of many millions of unique workplaces into which we have limited, imperfect visibility.\nAs we collect more personal information about our users that may be displayed publicly, there may be instances where the mechanisms we have designed to protect your anonymity fail.\nThis is never our intention, and we take multiple steps to ensure this is not the case.\nBut, in the interests of transparency, we want to be sure we make you are fully aware of this risk.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<strong>Seventh</strong>, we will never sell or transfer your D&amp;I information to a third-party in a way that would present a risk to your anonymity (i.e., we will never transfer your D&amp;I information to a third-party in conjunction with other particular information about you sufficient for a third-party to identify you).\nWe may, however, disclose your D&amp;I information to one of our affiliates or service providers as defined and described in this Policy to enable affiliate or service-provider data processing for purposes consistent with this Policy and the principles outlined herein (see the section of this Policy titled \u201cHow We Share Information/Recipients\u201d).\nWe may also anonymize and/or aggregate and make available data to third parties and the public as described in this Policy (e.g., to provide insights into diversity metrics in particular areas, industries, companies, or countries, or make available data reports outlining economic or labor trends).</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Use D&amp;I Information&nbsp;</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Depending on your selections if and as you elect to disclose D&amp;I information, we will use the data you provide to implement new platform features, track various diversity and inclusion trends across industries, countries, and globally, and push employers to begin sharing diversity data and make changes to their practices in response to the insights we provide.</p>\n<p>As a registered user of our Platform, Glassdoor processes your D&amp;I and some non-D&amp;I information in accordance with our contractual obligations based on the Terms of Use, this Policy, and your consent for the following purposes:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing insights into wage discrepancies (e.g., showing gender and racial/ethnic wage gap disparities)</li>\n<li>Providing D&amp;I-based analysis of jobs and companies (e.g., we may utilize D&amp;I information to generate reports highlighting employers that best embrace diversity, support LGBTQ rights, minimize wage gaps, etc.)</li>\n<li>Providing diversity and inclusion metrics and ratings (e.g., provide insights for job seekers who want to learn more about diversity and inclusion with respect to specific industries or companies)</li>\n<li>Providing search optimization and filtering via diversity data (e.g., providing users the ability to filter Glassdoor content or companies based on certain employer qualities or employee experiences and attributes.\nfor example, employers that are supportive of LGBTQ+ rights or who are particularly supportive of women with respect to enhanced maternity leave benefits.\nAs users provide D&amp;I information, their reviews may be associated with aggregated categories, such as filtering for all the African-American, Pacific Islander, and Latinx reviews for a particular company/all the reviews for an industry.\nIn some instances, particular reviews may be tagged with D&amp;I attributes.)</li>\n<li>Enhancing employer/employee diversity disclosures for job seekers (e.g., we may allow employers to share internal diversity data, diversity program details, and testimonials from their own employees;&nbsp.\nwe may provide opportunities for jobseekers and employees to engage and have anonymous discussions on D&amp;I-related and other topics, )&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Incorporating D&amp;I information into existing or new products and services otherwise detailed in this Policy (see the section of this Policy titled \u201cHow We Use Your Information\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>How We Share D&amp;I Information/Recipients</strong>\n</p>\n<p>As we describe in Section Seven of our D&amp;I Information Principles above, we may share D&amp;I information consistent with our Policy overall.\nPlease refer to the section of this Policy titled \u201cHow We Share Information/Recipients\u201d.</p> Cookie Policy and Ad Choices <p>This Cookie Policy describes how Glassdoor uses Cookies and similar technologies.\nFor more information on our general data privacy practices, please see the full Privacy Policy.</p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>\n<p>Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on your computer, mobile phone, or other device when you first visit a page.\nWe use cookies, web beacons, locally shared objects (sometimes called \u201cflash cookies\u201d), mobile identifiers and similar technologies (\u201cCookies\u201d) to help us recognize you on the Platform, enhance your user experience, understand usage of the Platform, and show you relevant advertising.\nCookies may also be set by other websites or services that run content on the page you\u2019re visiting.\nAfter you register on the Platform, we may connect information we collect from the Cookies set by us and our partners with other information received from you.\nThe provision of your data via Cookies is voluntary except for those Cookies that we place on your device because we need them for the performance of our Platform and our services.</p>\n<strong>What types of Cookies do we use?</strong>\n<p>We use two types of Cookies on the Platform: \u201csession cookies\u201d and \u201cpersistent cookies.\u201d Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain on your device until you leave the Platform.\nA persistent Cookie remains on your device for much longer until you manually delete it (how long the Cookie remains will depend on the duration or \u201clifetime\u201d of the specific Cookie and your browser settings).</p>\n<strong>What are Cookies used for?</strong>\n<p>Cookies transmit information about you and your use of the Platform, such as your browser type, search preferences, job titles, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use.\nWith the exception of an identifier Cookie that we associate with registered accounts to prevent fraud by members of the Platform, Cookies link to certain unique information such as the job titles that you entered at time of registration or on your profile, but this is not linked to your name.\nWe use four types of cookies: Strictly Necessary, Functional, Analytics, and Targeting.\nYou can reference which specific cookies fall into each category by using our Cookie Consent Tool in our website footer.</p>\n<strong>We use Cookies for things like:</strong>\n<strong>Purpose</strong>\n<strong>Explanation</strong>AuthenticationWe use Cookies to help us determine whether or not you\u2019ve signed in to the Platform and to keep you signed in during visits as you access different pages.SecurityWe use Cookies to enable and support security features, prevent fraud, and protect your data from unauthorised access.Preferences and FeaturesWe use Cookies to enable features and help us provide you with personalised content, such as showing you your recent search activity.AdvertisingWe use Cookies to deliver, evaluate and improve advertising, such as by using information about you to provide relevant advertising both on and off the Platform.\nOur Ad Partners may use a cookie to determine whether you\u2019ve already been shown an advert or how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interacted with an ad.Analytics and PerformanceWe use Cookies to analyze how our visitors use the Platform and to monitor site performance.\nThese Cookies help us to identify and fix errors, understand and improve services, research and test out different features, and monitor how our visitors reach our sites.\nTargeting Cookies: <strong>Ad Choices and Managing Cookies</strong>\n<p>Glassdoor works with several third parties to provide you with personalized, interest-based advertising.\nWe may target ads to you, and measure their performance, on and off the Platform using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Member-provided profile information (e.g., job title, occupation, location, authorized information shared from your Social Networking Site)</li>\n<li>Your use of the Platform (e.g., search history, job clicks, companies you follow);</li>\n<li>Information inferred from data described above (e.g., using job titles from a profile to infer industry, seniority, and compensation bracket).</li>\n<li>IP address or mobile device location information (to the extent you have enabled location tracking on your device);</li>\n<li>Cookies (both on and off the Platform) which may include information from the Ad Partners we use to help deliver relevant ads to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>How We Work with Third-Party Ad Partners</strong>\n<p>When we work with our Ad Partners to serve you personalized, interest-based advertising, we do not share information with them that they can use to identify you or associate with you as a specific individual unless you have instructed us to do so (such as when you fill out a lead form in an ad, or approve your Profile for display to employers).\nSimilarly, if one of these Ad Partners has information about you saved in one of their own Cookies on your browser, they use that information to help us send you a relevant ad, but they do not share with us information that we can associate with you as an individual.</p>\n<p>We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Glassdoor generally.\nWe have also implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, which categorizes Cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Platform and various websites across the internet.\nIn addition, a Cookie on some of our employer clients sites provides us with aggregate data about the number of applications submitted to those sites by users of Platform.</p> Consenting to Cookies and Opting Out of Cookies <p>As we describe in our cookie banner (for our users in jurisdictions where we display a consent banner) and in our Cookie Consent Tool (located in the Glassdoor website footer), we use Cookies that are strictly necessary for us to provide the services you use and you cannot opt out of these Cookies on the Platform.\nBy utilizing our Cookie Consent Tool, you can reject all but Strictly Necessary cookies, or opt out if specific categories of cookies at any time (as described above and in the Tool).\nYou are also able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies, though this may worsen your user experience.\nAdditionally, you can also control, manage and/or delete cookies via your browser settings.\nA useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at AboutCookies.org.</p>\n<p>If you enable location data for the mobile version of the Platform (including any version installed as a native application), we may use your location data to serve you geo-targeted ads for employers and other advertisers that are local to you.\nIn such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network.\nrather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push ads through to users located in certain areas.\nYou may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the Glassdoor native app settings.</p>\n<strong>Ad Partner Cookies</strong>\n<p>Here are some options for managing the third-party Cookies used by our Ad Partners:</p>\n<p>When visiting Glassdoor from a region where applicable law requires consent for the use of non-strictly necessary cookies, we surface a cookie consent banner and request your consent.\nYou can adjust Cookie preferences on Glassdoor through our Cookie Consent Tool located in the Glassdoor footer.</p>\n<p>You are also able to opt out of other third-party advertiser and ad network placement of Cookies or targeted advertising generally by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative.\nDigital Advertising Alliance.\nEuropean Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (for users in the EU).\nThe Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (for users in Canada).\nor you can follow opt-out instructions of the Ad Partners we work with listed here.\nYou will continue to receive generic ads by companies not listed with these opt-out tools.</p>\n<p>You can opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services by visiting Google Ads Settings or by downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.</p>\n<p>\n<em>Please note:</em> If ads or other features on the Platform are provided by third parties, those parties set and use their own Cookies that are subject to those third parties\u2019 privacy notices and policies.\nGlassdoor does not have access to, or control over, these Cookies.\nAlso, if you respond to ads posted by third parties or submit information to third parties via the Platform, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.</p>\n<strong>Do Not Track Signals</strong>\n<p>We do not currently respond to \u2018do not
