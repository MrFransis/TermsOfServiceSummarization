Culture, LLC (\u201cOpen Culture,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared.&nbsp.\nThis Privacy Policy explains how Open Culture collects and uses information at its website located at www.openculture.com and at other websites and mobile services provided by Open Culture (collectively the \u201cNetwork Websites\u201d).&nbsp.\nThis Privacy Policy also explains how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of certain types of information that we collect.&nbsp.\nWe will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources.&nbsp.\nFurther, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any websites, webpages, blogs, applications, widgets or other services operated by any third party, including our affiliates, advertisers, providers and partners.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>1.\nInformation We Collect</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>A.\nPersonally Identifiable Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In general, Open Culture does not collect personally identifiable information on the Open Culture Services, except as set forth below.&nbsp.\nFor purposes of this Privacy Policy, \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d is data intended to be used to identify, contact or locate a person, including, name, address, telephone number or e-mail address and any other information (even if non-personally identifiable) provided in combination with such personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>You may provide us information about yourself, such as your name or e-mail address, when you use or post content on or though the Open Culture Services, including registering for the use of certain features such as email RSS feeds.&nbsp.\nIf you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address, and our responses.&nbsp.\nWe may also retain any messages or other content you send through or post on the Open Culture Services.</p>\n<p>The advertisements we deliver may offer the ability to interact, including playing a game or viewing a video.&nbsp.\nThe ad may also give you the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about yourself.&nbsp.\nIn some instances, if you choose to interact with an advertisement or provide an advertiser with information about yourself, Open Culture may collect information on behalf of the advertiser.&nbsp.\nIn that case, the advertiser\u2019s privacy policy would apply to the data collected and we will abide by the instructions given to us by the advertiser in our handling of the data.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture will not associate any information (non-personally identifiable or personally identifiable) we collect for an advertiser with any other information we may have collected about you through the Open Culture Services.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nNon-Personally Identifiable Information </strong>\n</p>\n<p>When you visit the Open Culture Services, Open Culture or third parties such as advertisers, third-party advertising networks, and third-party advertising serving companies may collect non-personally identifiable information.&nbsp.\nFor purposes of this Privacy Policy, \u201cnon-personally identifiable information\u201d is data that is not personally identifiable.\nOpen Culture and these third parties may implement certain technologies to enable the collection of such information.&nbsp.\nAn explanation of these technologies is below.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Cookies Information</em>: </strong>When you visit the Open Culture Services, we may send one or more cookies\u2014a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters\u2014to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Open Culture help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.&nbsp.\nA cookie may also convey information about how you browse the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture uses session, persistent, flash and browser cookies.&nbsp.\nThe use of cookies on the Open Culture Services is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp.\nA persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser.&nbsp.\nPersistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site.&nbsp.\nPersistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser\u2019s directions.&nbsp.\nA session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.&nbsp.\nYou can set your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp.\nHowever, some features of the Open Culture Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Device Identifiers</em>\n</strong>\n<strong>: </strong>When you access the Open Culture Services by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more \u201cdevice identifiers.\u201d&nbsp.\nDevice identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device that uniquely identify your mobile device and are used by Open Culture to enhance your use of the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.\nA device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device\u2019s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Open Culture.&nbsp.\nA device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.\nA device identifier does not collect or share any personally identifiable information about you.&nbsp.\nHowever, a device identifier may be used in conjunction with other information in a manner that may constitute personally identifiable information.&nbsp.\nA device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.\nSome features of the Open Culture Services may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers are impaired or disabled.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Web Beacons/Click-Stream Data</em>\n</strong>\n<strong>: </strong>A web beacon is an electronic file that signals when a webpage, advertisement, video, other content, an email, or a newsletter has been viewed.&nbsp.\nWe may use web beacons in our emails and newsletters, or on our websites and services.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture may use web beacons in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data that helps us better understand how visitors move from page to page within our websites.&nbsp.\nAs with cookies, our use of web beacons is anonymous and does not allow us to gather personally identifiable information about you.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Passive Browser Information</em>\n</strong>\n<strong>:</strong> Open Culture collects passive browser information though its web servers.&nbsp.\nWe use the passive browser information to help us understand how many visitors come to our websites and where they come from, and ultimately to help us make decisions about how to organize the websites and deliver advertising.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Log File Information</em>: </strong>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page.&nbsp.\nWhen you use the Open Culture Services, our servers automatically record certain log file information.&nbsp.\nThese server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, data about how you interact with links on the Open Culture Services, and other such information.&nbsp.\nWe may display your IP address to the owners or maintainers of certain blogs, groups or communities if you post to those blogs, groups or communities and the owner or maintainer has enabled functionality for this purpose.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>\n<em>Scripts</em>\n</strong>:&nbsp.\nA script is a short segment of computer code included in a web page or other content that can be used to set and access a cookie on your computer\u2019s hard drive and to record your activity on a website.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture may use scripts on the Open Culture Services, on third-party websites, or in our emails and newsletters.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nThird Party Advertisements<br>\n</strong>\n</p>\n<p>If an advertiser asks Open Culture to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.&nbsp.\nIn addition, third-party advertisers may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the Open Culture Services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that they believe may be of interest to you.&nbsp.\nIf you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please see the list provided immediately below.&nbsp.\nThis Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.&nbsp.\nPlease consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more

the sharing of personally identifiable information.\n(2) to provide Open Culture\u2019s services to you.\n(3) to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to assist government enforcement agencies, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.\n(4) if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding third-party claims or allegations, illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety or property of another person, violation of our Terms and Conditions of Service.\nor (7) as otherwise required by law.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture may also store personally identifiable information and user content in locations outside the direct control of Open Culture (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).</p>\n<p>Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Open Culture Services, such as messages, comments or other user content, becomes available to the public.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>B.\nNon-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that we use a third party to provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf, Open Culture may share non-personally identifiable information with the third party to be used by them only for the purpose of providing their services to Open Culture.</p>\n<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Open Culture Services, and as part of the function of our business.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>C.\nTransfer of Data</strong>\n</p>\n<p>In the event that Open Culture sells, transfers or otherwise relinquishes all or part of our assets, business offerings, or services, including any of the Open Culture Services, information that you have shared with Open Culture or that Open Culture has collected, including both personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information, may be one of the business assets that will be transferred.&nbsp.\nWe may also transfer or assign such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.&nbsp.\nThe transferred information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy or those of subsequent policies to which you have consented.&nbsp.\nIf Open Culture is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>4.\nContent Removal</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Open Culture reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the user content you post on any of the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.\nWe reserve the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any law or our Terms and Conditions of Service, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>5.\nData Retention</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Open Culture may retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including user

period of up to twelve months.&nbsp.\nSuch data may be aggregated and used for analytical purposes indefinitely.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>6.\nHow We Protect Your Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Open Culture cares about the integrity and security of your personal information.&nbsp.\nWe cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Open Culture or guarantee that your

as otherwise required by law.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>8.\nYour Choices About Your Information</strong>\n</p>\n<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the

management panel of the Adobe Flash Player to limit your acceptance of or delete cookies.&nbsp.\nBecause the management of cookies in various browsers differs, you should consult the documentation for your browser in order to manage your cookies.&nbsp.\nIn order to limit the acceptance of or disable \u201cflash\u201d cookies, you must access the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player installed

at:&nbsp.\nhttp://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.&nbsp.\nYou can opt-out of receiving cookies from Targusinfo, a specific third-party data provider, by following the instructions at:&nbsp.\nhttp://www.adadvisor.net/optout.html.&nbsp.\nAlso, because your choices are not associated with you as a particular individual, if you change computers, web browsers or cookie settings, you will need to re-implement your preferences as described above.&nbsp.\nNote that if you limit or disable cookies, this does not mean that you will not see ads on the Open Culture Services.\nInstead, ads will be displayed that are based on passive browser information or other information that that may be provided by the Open Culture Services at the time of your visit.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>9.\nChildren\u2019s Privacy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture and its related websites are not structured to attract children under 13 years of age.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture prohibits the use of our websites or services by anyone under 13 years of age.&nbsp.\nOpen Culture does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for any of the Open Culture Services.&nbsp.\nIf you are under 13, please do not access the Open Culture Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.&nbsp.\nIn the event that we learn that we have collected personal

about a child under 13, please contact us at mail@openculture.com.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>10.\nLinks to Other Websites</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Open Culture Services, nor the information or content contained therein.&nbsp.\nPlease remember that when you use a link to go from within the Open Culture Services to an outside

website\u2019s own rules and policies.\nPlease read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>11.\nNotification Procedures</strong>\n</p>\n<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the applicable Open Culture website or service, as determined by Open Culture in its sole discretion.\nWe reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>12.\nGoverning Law</strong>\n</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>13.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Open Culture may modify or update this Privacy Policy at its sole discretion from time to time, and so you should review this Privacy Policy periodically.&nbsp.\nWhen we change the policy in a material way, we will notify you by means of a notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective.&nbsp.\nChanges to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.&nbsp.\nYour continued access to the Open Culture
