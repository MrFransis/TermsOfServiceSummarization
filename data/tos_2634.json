One of the most important to factors in ranking well on every major search engine is to have a keyword-rich domain name that targets the main keyword(s) of your site.</p>\n<p>With Who.is, you can start with a keyword search and fine tune your domain search to display your TLD of choice, hyphenated domains, and limit the amount of characters to get the most concise, brandable, and SEO-friendly domain name possible.</p> ccTLD's and gTLD's <p>What is a TLD? A top-level domain (TLD) is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System of the Internet (think .com, .biz, .uk etc.).\nWho.is offers data on a wide variety of domains including country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and generic op level domains (gTLDs).\nGeneric TLDs are the most prevalent domain extensions such as .COM, .NET, .EDU, and .GOV just to name a few.\nCountry code domains (ccTLDs) are domain extensions that represent different countries but can be used creatively to brand your business in a unique way.</p>\n<p>For example, www.Who.is uses the domain extension \u201c.IS\u201d which is the ccTLD of Iceland.\nOther ccTLDs such as .TV (from the islands of Tuvalu) have become extremely popular as a way for U.S.\ncompanies to brand sites that contain largely video-based content.</p> What is a Domain Name Anyway? <p>A domain name It is a unique identifier - combination of letters and/or numbers - which identifies a specific website or computer on the Internet.</p>\n<p>There are three parts of a domain name: Top-level, second level, and third level.\nThe top level refers to the end of the domain (such as .com) and identifies the type of organization.\nA second level domain is the common name identifier such as \u201cGoogle\u201d and identifies the organization\u2019s website.\nThe third level domain is at the beginning of the domain name (e.g.\nwww) and identifies a particular host server.</p>\n<p>With the wide variety of domains available, and the complexity of finding that perfect domain, make your domain search and WHOIS lookup simpler today with Who.is!</p> ", "created_at": "2021-01-22 22:37:38.503884", "updated_at": "2021-01-24 08:50:28.815599"}, {"id": 3782, "name": "Terms of Service", "url":
