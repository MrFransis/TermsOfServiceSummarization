"EvergreenTech.io Terms of Service<p>It is compulsory that you completely agree to the below terms of service before creating your EvergreenTech.io account and enrolling in any services.\nBy using or continuing to use any of the EvergreenTech.io services, you are automatically agreeing to the conditions of this document.</p>\n<p>The EvergreenTech.io terms of service (\u201cTOS\u201d) have been designed to provide our clients with a very clear and transparent understanding of what we expect of them while using any of the services offered.\nThe use or continued use of any of the EvergreenTech.io services represents your complete acceptance and compliance to the EvergreenTech.io TOS, regardless of whether you have physically read them or not.</p>\n<p>Upon initial registration, EvergreenTech.io has accepted your use of our services across our entire network.\nFor this reason under normal conditions your accounts activity will not be monitored regularly.\nAdditionally, EvergreenTech.io does not implement editorial control over any content of any web site.\nThis includes but is not limited to newsgroup material, e-mails, articles, or personal blogs.\nHowever in full agreement with the EvergreenTech.io TOS, EvergreenTech.io reserves the right to remove any material that in our judgement appears to be illegal, may subject EvergreenTech.io to any degree of liability or may violate the EvergreenTech.io TOS.\nEvergreenTech.io will always reserve the right to assist with legal proceedings whether that is with third parties and/or directly with law enforcement to further examine any suspected or alleged crime or civil offense.\nViolation of the EvergreenTech.io TOS to any extent may result in the immediate suspension or termination of your relevant EvergreenTech.io service in addition to the suspension or termination of any other EvergreenTech.io services you may have.</p>\n<p>All EvergreenTech.io services experience irregular monitoring for system exploitation, security and fraud risks.\nAll risks and/or inappropriate use of any EvergreenTech.io services that EvergreenTech.io discovers as well as those brought to the attention of EvergreenTech.io through third parties that violate the EvergreenTech.io TOS will result in swift action taken against the offending client with consequences deemed appropriate by EvergreenTech.io.</p>\n<p>If any EvergreenTech.io client directly or indirectly violates the EvergreenTech.io TOS, EvergreenTech.io reserves the right to terminate any and all services linked to the offending client without notice.\nIf EvergreenTech.io perceives the offense to be unbeknownst to the client, EvergreenTech.io under the sole discretion of EvergreenTech.io will notify the offending client of the mischievous or inappropriate activity alongside any necessary corrective action that EvergreenTech.io deems appropriate.\nIf corrective action is not volunteered by the offending client in a period of time EvergreenTech.io finds reasonable or if EvergreenTech.io perceives the offense to be deliberate and obvious violations of the EvergreenTech.io TOS, EvergreenTech.io will take immediate action against the offending client.\nIt must be understood that a delayed action or complete failure on EvergreenTech.io \u2019 part to implement this policy for whatever reason will not be construed as a waiver of EvergreenTech.io\u2019 right to do so at any time.</p>\n<p>In review, while utilizing any of the EvergreenTech.io\u2019 services you alongside the rest of the EvergreenTech.io client base are expected to access your account morally, sensibly and most of all responsibly.</p>1.\nEvergreenTech.io Account Activation and Setup<p>Once your order has been placed, your EvergreenTech.io account will be provisioned immediately.\nThe setup of your service, however, requires manual intervention as it is processed after payment has been received for potentially fraudulent activity.\nSetup time drastically differs depending upon the complexities of your requests \u2013 on average our custom-tailored virtual and dedicated managed hosting environments are deployed in under 120 minutes, but please speak with your account representative for an accurate estimate.\nThese estimates exclude migration time.</p>2.\nData Migration Policy<p>EvergreenTech.io is capable of migrating any application or website to our infrastructure, generally free of charge.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes EvergreenTech.io must contact your previous provider to complete the migration.\nIf this is required, we offer this service free of charge.\nEvergreenTech.io will begin your migration typically immediately after the proper credentials have been shared and your account has been set up.\nWe will always work as fast as we can and keep you updated throughout, but it is recommended to do migrations during off-peak hours to account for potential issues with the previous host as well as propagation of the DNS (domain name servers).</p>\n<p>EvergreenTech.io offers our free migration service under a best-faith effort policy.\nEvergreenTech.io does not make any guarantees or take on any liability with potential issues that may arise.\nIt is your responsibility to keep backups.\nIf any issues are found, EvergreenTech.io will work to resolve them under the best-faith effort policy, but will not make any guarantees of any kind.\nWhile we do perform many quality checks, it is ultimately your responsibility to confirm everything has been migrated properly.</p>3.\nGeneral Content

appropriate backup will always be obtainable.\nYou agree to take full responsibility for any and all data transferred to and from EvergreenTech.io servers and to preserve suitable backups of said

fit.\nEvergreenTech.io will treat all data associated with the termination of an account as outlined in the above section 5.II.</p>11.\nResource Usage Limitations<p>Please realize that these policies are in place to protect our clients (you) from poor service.\nTypically, if we have to impose a restriction on an account for resource usage, that account is already in violation of several aspects of the EvergreenTech.io TOS, and not just these usage policies.\nMost clients who fall into this realm affect at least two of these policies, and if left unchecked would begin adversely affecting other clients on their server.\nThe overwhelming majority of sites will never have to take these limits into consideration.\nThat being said, it is important they are in place and it is important you are aware of them.</p>\n<p>EvergreenTech.io uses soft limits to enforce most of these limitations.\nThese limits do not \u201ckill\u201d your service when reached, but rather set off a series of notifications in motion to notify us of potential issues.\nMany clients will find that they can exceed many or even most without receiving a notice from us.\nThe issue becomes when a single account starts to affect the performance of an entire server, it is then necessary to have these limits in place.\nEvergreenTech.io has been known to give extensive leeway to folks who need it, providing them time to work with us to reduce the overall load or if not possible, enter discussions for a potential upgrade.\nWith our highly optimized servers, it is rare we ever have to suspend a client for abuse, but under the EvergreenTech.io TOS, we do reserve the right to do so if excessive.</p>12.\nPrice Change<p>EvergreenTech.io reserves the right to change the prices and plans listed throughout the EvergreenTech.io website in addition to the resources allocated to each of the EvergreenTech.io plans at its own discretion.\nFurther, EvergreenTech.io has the right to end and/or refuse any promotional codes for any reason.</p>13.\nAuto Billing (Recurring Payments)<p>For convenience and to prevent an interruption in service, EvergreenTech.io has employed a reoccurring billing cycle on most monthly, quarterly, semiannual and annual plans.\nIf you do not want reoccurring payments on your account it is necessary to notify EvergreenTech.io at least seven (7) days prior to the payment taking place.\nFailure on your part to notify EvergreenTech.io of your intention to not be billed on a reoccurring basis will automatically result in your account being billed as originally agreed.\nIf you are using PayPal subscriptions, it is your responsibility to cancel with PayPal directly.</p>14.\nBandwidth Usage<p>When purchasing you selected a monthly bandwidth allowance based on the package chosen.\nIt is your sole responsibility to be aware of such limitations and will not hold EvergreenTech.io liable for any downtime experienced from account suspensions due to bandwidth overages.\nIf overages are experienced or projected for a certain month, all EvergreenTech.io clientele have the option to upgrade to a larger plan or wait until the following month.\nBandwidth usage is measured on a monthly basis coinciding with the Client\u2019s billing cycle.</p>15.\nResponsibilities And Expected Knowledge<p>By the use of any EvergreenTech.io service a certain level of knowledge is assumed on topics consisting of but are not limited to.\ninternet languages, slang, jargon, terminology, protocols, name servers (DNS), website development and software.\nWhile knowledge levels differ greatly, the EvergreenTech.io client agrees that they possess the necessary knowledge to create their website with the desired content, look and functionality.\nThe customer agrees that it is not the responsibility for EvergreenTech.io to provide this knowledge to help create, design, program or publishing of a client\u2019s website.</p>16.\nRoot And SSH Access<p>SSH access is
