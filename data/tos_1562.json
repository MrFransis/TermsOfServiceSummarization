DIY Tube Video Community to comply with all federal and local tax laws for each country in which a member resides.\nAs with any site which pays its members, some personal information is required for payment purposes.</p>\n<p>It is the member\u2019s responsibility to maintain up to date personal information in their account.\nDIY Tube Video Community cannot be held responsible for lost or missing payments due to incorrect personal information.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Rewards And Payments</strong>\n</p>\n<p>After October 10, 2019,&nbsp.\nDIY Tube Coin will be launched on our own blockchain.\nDIY Tube Coins are rewards for members of the DIY Tube Video Community website.\nOnce DIYT Coin is openly trading on exchanges, it will have real value and can be traded or sold or exchanged for fiat currency.&nbsp.\nFor this reason each member is responsible for maintaining their personal information and protecting their passwords and usernames.\nDIYT Coins should be treated as money due to their value on the coin exchanges and for use inside the community.</p>\n<p>Members are paid for video views, comments and thumbs up on both their comments and their videos.\nPayments are made every 24 hours inside the DIY Tube Video Community.</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Video Community will take every precaution to protect its members personal information and rewards.\nDIY Tube cannot be held liable for loss of data or theft due to hacked accounts or weak passwords.</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Video Community reserves the right to close any account found violating these terms and conditions, including the freezing of assets or returning any earned rewards to the community pool wallet.\nThis will only happen under extreme circumstances and after multiple fair warnings.\nFrozen accounts will be retained for a period of time in order to allow the member to later return after a suspension.\nOnly after multiple warnings and suspensions for violation of these terms will an account be fully closed and its funds returned to the pool.\nThis is an extreme situation and not the norm.</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Video Community reserves the right to immediately terminate an account without warning for the protection of the community as a whole, if needed.\nThis situation could occur, for example, when a member uploads copyrighted materials and DIY Tube receives a copyright complaint from the original content owner.</p>\n<p>Copy/paste spam, comment spam or manipulation of video views in order to falsely increase earnings will result in immediate termination of a member\u2019s account, thereby freezing all earnings in the virtual wallet.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, the use of bots or other programs or apps which are used to falsely increase video views or generate comments.\nDIY Tube Video Community software searches for patterns of abuse which are then confirmed by a live administrator.</p>\n<p>Since early 2018 members have been receiving virtual DIY Tube Coins inside DIY Tube Video Community.\nVirtual DIY Tube Coins have been a sort of IOU for the launch of the official blockchain and DIY Tube Coin.\nDIY Tube Video Community cannot predict the future nor guaranty success and can therefore make no promises on the future value of DIYT Coin and the blockchain.\nWe can, at this time, only offer hope that as we grow together, we can all share the wealth in the future.</p>\n<p>Together we can grow the value of the DIY Tube Video Community and the value of DIY Tube Coins by uploading videos, commenting, interacting and spreading the word.\nAs the community grows, so will its value.</p>\n<p>No guaranty of DIYT Coin value will be made at this time, nor can it be guaranteed in the future.\nThe success of the community depends on its overall growth and future coin value.\nDIYT Coins are useful inside the community for purchasing perks and upgrades, trading and tipping others for a good video.\nOther uses for internal virtual DIYT and more perks are planned for the future as well as an internal store where members will be able to purchase items with their DIYT Coins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Spam, Plagiarism, Harassment or Abuse</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Spam, plagiarism, or other copyright violations will not be tolerated.\nVideos portraying parodies of another member of the DIY Tube Video Community will be removed without notice.\nHarassment, trolling or other related behavior is not acceptable and may get your account suspended.\nCopy/paste comments will be removed without notice by the DIY Tube team.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Freedom Of Speech</strong>\n</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Video Community supports the freedom of speech as long as that freedom does not impinge on another member\u2019s freedom.\nMembers are free to upload content or leave comments as long as they do not violate the terms and conditions in this contract.</p>\n<p>Channel owners and video owners reserve the full right to modify, filter or delete any comments or content on their own channel which they deem unfit or in violation of their own freedom.</p>\n<p>In the DIY Tube Video Community the freedom of speech does NOT imply the ability to slander, harass or otherwise violate the freedom of another member of the community.</p>\n<p>Simply stated: Your freedom ends when it impinges on another member\u2019s freedom or rights.</p>\n<p>A channel is a member\u2019s personal space.\nConsider this: If you came to my house and spray painted vulgar obscenities about my family on my house \u2013 do I not have the right to remove it?</p>\n<p>DIY Tube is intended to be a family oriented community and all state and federal laws apply.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Other</strong>\n</p>\n<p>Violation of any of these terms may result in termination of your account.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to amend or modify these terms without prior notice.\nAlthough the DIY Tube Video team will attempt to contact members about major changes to these terms, there is no guaranty we can reach everyone due to a full inbox, incorrect email addresses or other issues.\nIt is the responsibility of the individual to read these terms and check back from time to time for updates.</p> ", "created_at": "2019-05-16 04:15:34.761904", "updated_at": "2020-12-14 22:13:17.751886"}, {"id": 1341, "name": "About  DIY TUBE Video Community", "url": "https://www.diytube.info/about/", "xpath": "//*[@id=\"post-2\"]", "text": " About <p>\n<strong>DIY TUBE Video Community</strong> pays you cryptocurrency for your activities.\nGet paid to share videos, comment and interact with one another.</p>\n<p>It all began in the fall of 2017 with an idea to preserve videos in case YouTube broke down or started to close channels.\nDIY Tube Video site was meant to be a backup of years of work.\nThe founder had about 2,000 videos on other platforms.\nBut why not open it up to other channels as well?</p>\n<p>So DIY Tube Video Community was born.</p>\n<p>The idea was to set up a platform with revenue sharing based on 50% of ad revenue shared with content creators.\nBut there was one big problem \u2013 you have to have a lot of traffic and many months behind you to be accepted by advertising companies.\nPlus there is the accounting nightmare of paying people in various countries along with sending out all those tax forms in different languages.</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Coins and the blockchain were formed to fill that gap.\nMembers of the DIY Tube Video community get paid in DIY Tube Coins for minutes viewed on their videos, comments and thumbs up.\nThese coins are run on our own blockchain.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning, the DIY Tube Video team itself has grown to include financial backing, a developer, beta tester, blockchain developer, videographers and more.\nHalf the team are original YouTubers themselves so we know what the community needs.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Why choose DIY Tube over the rest?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>We offer the following to everyone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em>Free</em> to join</li>\n<li>\n<em>Free</em> cloud storage for your videos</li>\n<li>\n<em>Freedom</em> of speech</li>\n<li>\n<em>Freedom</em> from harassment</li>\n<li>Perks and rewards for all activity</li>\n<li>\n<em>Instant</em> membership approval</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Instant monetization</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Members are free to join up and share their videos immediately.\nThere is no waiting time and no approval required to become a member of DIY Tube.\nIts that easy.</p>\n<p>Your videos are stored for free \u2013 always.\nMembers will never have to pay for storage of their videos.</p>\n<p>Members are allowed to voice their opinions and express themselves as long as they do not impinge on another member\u2019s rights.\nThis summarizes our entire terms and conditions.\nMembers are empowered to help keep the community clean and family friendly.</p>\n<p>Everyone gets paid for their activities.\nDIY Tube pays members for video views, comments and thumbs up on both.\nStart earning right away.\nPayments in DIYT Coins are given out every 24 hours so if you make a comment today, you get paid tomorrow.\nEarnings can be used to obtain perks and upgrades such as getting your video or channel on the homepage of DIY Tube.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Payment Schedule</strong>\n</p>\n<p>(see note below)</p>\n<p>100 comments = 1 DIYT</p>\n<p>100 thumbs up = 1 DIYT</p>\n<p>1,000 video views = 10 DIYT</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Coins can be broken up into 8 decimal points.\nThis allows fractional payments based on your community interaction.\nIt also allows flexibility as DIY Tube Coins go up in value.</p>\n<p>Thumbs up minus thumbs down are used to calculate your payment along with total comments and video views divided by percentage of minutes watched per video.</p>\n<p>Computer algorithms keep track of your earnings and also prevent spam and fraud.</p>\n<p>Here are some earnings examples:</p>\n<p>1,000 video views at 70% of minutes watched = 7 DIYT</p>\n<p>80 comments = 0.8 DIYT</p>\n<p>100 thumbs up \u2013 25 thumbs down = 0.75 DIYT</p>\n<p>Total earnings = 8.55 DIYT Coins</p>\n<p>\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> payments will be adjusted as the value of DIY Tube Coins go up or down in order to provide fair and competitive payments to members of the DIY Tube Video Community.\nPayments will also be adjusted (increased) at times for promotions in order to draw in more traffic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Use Of DIY Tube Coins</strong>\n</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Coins can be saved for their future value, traded or sold on coin exchanges or invested back into the community for perks.</p>\n<p>Upon initial release of DIY Tube Coins and integration into the video community site on Oct 16, 2019, DIYT is valued at $0.10 per coin.\nFuture ad revenue from DIY Tube Video community will be invested back into the community to further increase earnings of our members.</p>\n<p>There is a total max supply of only 500 million DIY Tube Coins ever available.\nThis allows enough coins to be used on the community pages but also increases their value due to their limited number.\nAs more DIYT are purchased and saved for their value, the number of coins in circulation will be reduced, further increasing their value.\nThis will also increase community member earnings.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Mining DIY Tube Coins</strong>\n</p>\n<p>DIY Tube Coins are also open to POW CPU and GPU miners as well as POS masternode holders.\nAfter four years we will switch to POS wallet holders and masternode holders only in order to reduce power consumption.\nAlthough our blockchain runs on the nist5 algorithm which is more efficient to begin with.</p>\n<p>In order to keep enough coins in circulation for the DIY Tube Video community, payments for video interaction will be capped at $10 worth of DIYT per 1,000 video views.\nThat is two times the amount paid out by any other site in this field.\nAt that point, as the coins continue to rise in value, payments will continue in fractions of a coin up to the $10 value cap.\nThis must be set in place in order to retain enough coins for circulation or the DIY Tube Video Community would come to a halt.</p>\n<p>Individual\u2019s coin values, which they already earned, will continue to rise with the market as well, allowing them to also cash in on the gains.</p>\n<p>DIYT Coins can also be used to promote a channel or a single video.\nThis allows members to gain more exposure on their channel as well as keep more coins in circulation in the community.\nPromotions can be run for an hour, a day, a week or a month.\nPromotions are listed based on the amount of DIYT Coins spent and the length of time selected.</p>\n<p>Pages for promoted videos and promoted channels are linked to the homepage to allow members to browse through them.</p>\n<p>Advertisers can purchase DIY Tube Coins and use them as payment for ads run on the DIY Tube Video homepage.\nAdvertisers can also self promote by setting up a video channel, uploading videos and promoting their own videos on the homepage.\nOpening up DIY Tube Coins to advertisers further increases their value and price on the open market.\nThese gains will be seen by the community members who hold DIY Tube Coins.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Welcome to DIY Tube Video Community</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Get paid for doing
