Providers.\nYou may use the Service to communicate with such Providers.\nYou understand that any decision to use the Service in such ways is entirely voluntary.\nYou understand that if you authorize a Provider to access your Personal Information in the Service and communicate with you via the Service that Provider may permit its/his/her staff and other authorized users within its/his/her facility or office to use the Service to access your Personal Information and communicate with you as well.\n</p>\n<p> Allscripts relies on the Providers authorized by you to confirm that they meet the criteria for participating in the Service.\nYou acknowledge and agree that Allscripts is not responsible for any such entity misidentifying itself or any misuse of the data by such health care providers or their authorized personnel.\nAllscripts' sole liability and sole responsibility shall be to discontinue access to any entity or individual which Allscripts learns misidentified itself/himself/herself or is otherwise misusing PHR Data.\n</p>\n<p> You may revoke any Provider's, other third-party's, or Authorized Individual's permission to (a) communicate with you through the Service.\n(b) request information from you or your FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record through the Service.\nor (c) provide Personal Information to your FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record by utilizing the connection management features of the Service.\nHowever, copies of all of your Personal Information previously disclosed to such Providers, third parties, or Authorized Individuals and incorporated into such Providers', third-parties', or Authorized Individuals' records, if any, may remain in such records.\nAllscripts cannot, and has no obligation to, remove such information from the Provider's, third-parties, or Authorized Individuals' records.\n</p>\n<p> Allscripts is relying on you to review and assess the qualifications of your Providers and to make appropriate decisions with respect to Authorized Individuals.\nAllscripts does not examine the credentials of, perform background checks on, or give its endorsement to any Provider or Authorized Individual.\n</p> Authorized Individuals <p> You may grant access to your FollowMyHealth account to one or more Authorized Individuals or Authorized Individual-Representatives.\nYou may grant an Authorized Individual access to your FollowMyHealth account by specifically authorizing FollowMyHealth to permit access by such Authorized Individual to your FollowMyHealth account.\nWhen you grant access to an Authorized Individual, you may permit the Authorized Individual to: (a) have the same level of access to your FollowMyHealth account as you have, i.e., the Authorized Individual will be authorized to access your FollowMyHealth health record and to communicate with your Providers and/or engage in other transactions with your Providers to the same extent that you are able using FollowMyHealth.\nor (b) have \"read-only\" access to your FollowMyHealth account, i.e., the Authorized Individual will be authorized to access your FollowMyHealth health record ONLY, and will NOT be able to communicate with or otherwise engage in transactions with your Providers.\nWhether or not you grant an Authorized Individual full-access or read-only access to your FollowMyHealth account is your decision.\nYou acknowledge and agree that: (a) you are solely responsible for verifying the identity of, and monitoring the use by, any Authorized Individual you select.\nand (b) Allscripts has no responsibility or

transactions as permitted between the Authorized Individual-Representative and the Dependent's Providers through the FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record.\nAccounts created for Dependents are specific to each health care Provider.\nThus, an Authorized Individual-Representative will have to specifically authorize each Provider practice to establish a FollowMyHealth account in the name of the Dependent.\nA Dependent's FollowMyHealth account will be linked to an Authorized Individual-Representative's FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record account until the earlier of the date: (i) the minor Dependent reaches the age of 18, or (ii) FollowMyHealth is notified by the Dependent's Provider or a court of law or agency with appropriate authority that the Dependent has been emancipated, attained legal custody of his or her own health information, or that a different Authorized Individual-Representative has been named.\nEach Authorized Individual-Representative understands that a Dependent's FollowMyHealth account also may be linked to the FollowMyHealth account of another Authorized Individual-Representative, and each Authorized Individual-Representative will have the same rights to access and communicate through the Dependent's FollowMyHealth account.\nEach Authorized Individual-Representative agrees that if he or she becomes aware of any change in any Authorized Individual-Representative's relationship to the Dependent that may result in the Authorized Individual-Representative no longer qualifying as an Authorized Individual-Representative, the Authorized Individual-Representative will advise the Dependent's Providers of the same.\n</p> Third-party Content &amp.\nServices <p> Allscripts may make third-party services available through the Service.\nFor
