After we receive a proper written notice, we will expeditiously remove or disable the allegedly infringing content, regardless of the nature of the copyright (a post, a webpage, or an application, for example).\nWe will document those alleged infringements on which we act.\nAlso, we will notify the user and, if requested, provide the report to the user.\nPlease note that in addition to being forwarded to the user who provided the allegedly infringing content, a copy of this legal notice (with your personal information removed) may be sent to a third-party which may publish and/or annotate it.\nIn appropriate circumstances, we will also exclude infringers from our websites who we suspect to be repeatedly or blatantly infringing copyrights.\nRestoration of the Removed Content <p>If a user of our websites believes that their content was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, the user may send us a written counter-notification which includes the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user\u2019s name, mailing address, telephone number and email address.</li>\n<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or disabled and the URL or other specific location on our websites at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled.</li>\n<li>A statement that: 1) the user consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court in which the user\u2019s address is located, or San Francisco, CA if the user\u2019s address is outside the United States, and 2) the user will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of infringement or an agent of such person.\n(An example would be: \u201cI consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court with jurisdiction in [person\u2019s city and state of residence or \u201cSan Francisco, CA\u201d], and I will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of infringement or an agent of such person.\u201d).</li>\n<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled (i.e.\n\u201cI swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that each search result, message, or other item of content identified above was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled, or that the material identified by the complainant has been removed or disabled at the URL identified and will no longer be shown.\u201d)</li>\n<li>The user\u2019s physical or electronic signature.</li>\n</ol> The End Result We may restore the removed or disabled content following 10 business days from the date that we received a proper written counter notification, unless our above copyright agent first receives notice that a court action has been filed to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity related to the removed or disabled content.\n", "created_at": "2021-06-24 01:00:02.265802", "updated_at": "2021-06-24 01:00:10.926444"}, {"id": 7264, "name": "Terms of Service", "url":
