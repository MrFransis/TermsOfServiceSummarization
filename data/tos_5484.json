chemicals present above certain minimum levels in any product the company is offering for sale in California.\nProposition 65 currently addresses over 800 chemicals and is regularly updated to add additional chemicals.\nProposition 65 does not ban the sale of a product that contains a listed chemical.\nit simply requires that the product bear a warning notice.\nProducts available for purchase via Our Website, including nutritional supplements, may contain chemicals to which Proposition 65 applies.\nIf a product contains a chemical on a Proposition 65 list, and the chemical is present in an amount above its Proposition 65 threshold \u2013 and the chemical is not naturally occurring in an ingredient in the dietary supplement \u2013 then a warning notice must be on the product to inform California consumers the chemical is present.\nWhen a Proposition 65 warning notice is present it does not mean the product is unsafe.\nThe notice is intended to inform California consumers of the presence of a listed chemical so the consumer can make an informed decision when purchasing the product.\nFor information about the chemicals listed under Proposition 65 go to
