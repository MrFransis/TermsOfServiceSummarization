as defined under applicable laws.\nFor more information on these rights, please refer to the additional disclosures below.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Data Retention</b>\n</p>\n<p>We may retain personal information

information about an Account to prevent that user from opening a new Account).</p>\n<p>\n<b>Security</b>\n</p>\n<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards and maintain reasonable safeguards designed to secure the information in our possession, and only those at Scopely with a legitimate business need to access your personal information are permitted to do so.\nWe also take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer information will provide protections appropriate to that type of information.\nIf you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately contact us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Use by Minors</b>\n</p>\n<p>We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from or about, or direct or target interest-based advertising to, anyone under the age of 13 (or under the age of 16 for those in the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland), nor do we knowingly allow such individuals to use our Services.\nIf you believe we might have any data from or about a child under this age, please contact us.\nIf we learn that we have inadvertently gathered such information, we will delete it.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional Information for Residents of the EEA, United Kingdom, and Switzerland</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Rights and Choices Available to EEA Residents</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of a member country of the

under EEA law:</p>\n<p>Access your personal data: You may have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we process your personal data and obtain a copy of the personal data we have collected about you.\n(Note that this right only applies to personal information relating to you, and not to any other player.)</p>\n<p>Rectify or correct your personal data: You may have the right to correct your personal data where it contains inaccuracies.</p>\n<p>Request erasure (deletion) of your personal data: You may have the right to request that Scopely delete your personal data in certain cases, for example when it is no longer necessary to fulfill the purposes for which Scopely collected it.\nThis right may be limited to the extent that Scopely is permitted or required by applicable law to retain the data.\n(Note that if you request deletion of your personal data, you may no longer be able to use or access the Services.\nIf you share devices with someone else who uses the Services, that person may also lose game progress or related account information and access.\nIf you decide to use or access the Services again, Scopely may consider this a new Account and may collect personal data associated with that Account in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)</p>\n<p>Restrict or object to the processing of your personal data: In certain cases, you may have the right to object to Scopely\u2019s processing of your personal data, or request that Scopely restrict that processing.\nBecause the data that Scopely collects is generally required to provide the Services to you, if you object to the processing of your personal data, this may have the same effect as requesting deletion of this data.\nThis right may be limited to the extent that Scopely is permitted or required by applicable law to continue processing the data.\n(Note that if you object to the processing of your personal data, you and others who use your devices to access the Services may no longer be able to use or access the Services.)</p>\n<p>Request a portable copy of your personal data: In certain limited cases, you may be able to request that Scopely provide you with a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format so that you can transmit it elsewhere.</p>\n<p>To protect the privacy of your information, Scopely verifies your identity and processes all rights requests through our in-game help ticket system.\nIf you wish to exercise any of the rights described above, please follow the instructions below and do not delete the game until your request is fulfilled:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Open the Scopely game(s) for which you wish to exercise your rights, and open an in-game help ticket via the Help section for that game.\n(If you have played multiple Scopely games and want to exercise rights as to all of them, please open a help ticket directly in-game via the Help section for each of those games.)</li>\n<li> Once you have opened a help ticket, please clearly state which right(s) you wish to exercise for that game.\nFor example, you can say \u201cI want to delete my personal data,\u201d or \u201cplease provide me with access to my personal data.\u201d We cannot begin processing your request until you have clearly stated which right(s) you wish to exercise.</li>\n<li> Make sure to include your city and country of residence in your request.\nWe cannot begin processing your request until you have confirmed your residence.\nWe will only use this information in order to fulfill and document your request.</li>\n<li> Repeat the above steps for any other games for which you would like to make a request.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you have trouble with any of the steps described above, you can contact privacy@scopely.com for help.\nWe may contact you to confirm your choices and to ask for additional information as needed to verify your identity and process your request.</p>\n<p>In addition to the rights described above, if we have collected and process certain types of personal data with your consent, you may withdraw that consent in the manner described when you provided consent.\nWithdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing conducted prior to then, nor will it affect any processing based on lawful grounds other than consent.</p>\n<p>In some cases, you may have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data.\nFor more information, contact your local data protection authority.\nWe will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities to resolve any privacy-related complaints that cannot be amicably resolved between you and us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you are from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, our legal basis for collecting and using your personal data will depend on the type of information and the context in which we collect it.\nIn general, we collect personal data from you only where we have your consent to do so, where we need it to perform a contract with you, or where it is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\nIn some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you or may otherwise need it to protect your vital interests or those of another person.\nIf you have questions about the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal data, please contact us.</p>\n<p>\n<b>EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles</b>\n</p>\n<p>We comply with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, onward transfer, and retention of personal data received from the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom, and Switzerland, as described in our EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certifications.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield List.\n[https://www.privacyshield.gov/list].\nPrivacy Shield participants are subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission and other authorized statutory bodies.\nUnder certain circumstances, participants may be liable for the transfer of personal data from the EU or Switzerland to third parties outside the EU and Switzerland.</p>\n<p>If you have a Privacy Shield-related complaint, please contact us.\nIf you feel your complaint remains unresolved after doing so, you may contact our US-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\nUnder certain conditions more fully described at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may be entitled to invoke the Privacy Shield binding arbitration process when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.\nIn certain situations, Scopely may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Additional Information for Residents of California</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Information We Collect, Use, and Disclose</b>\n</p>\n<p>California law requires us to disclose

liability under Section 8 below, the Services are provided on an \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available\u201d basis for your use, with no warranties of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, and those arising from course of dealing or usage of trade.\nScopely does not warrant that you will be able to access or use our Service at the times or locations of your choosing.\nthat our Services will be of a certain quality or suitability, or will be uninterrupted or error-free.\nthat defects will be corrected.\nor that our Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>\n<p>\n<b>8.\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Limitation of Liability</b>\n<br>\nScopely will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or other similar damages, including but not limited to loss of revenues, lost profits, lost data or business interruption or other intangible losses (however such losses are qualified), arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or our Services, whether based on contract, tort or any other legal theory, and whether or not Scopely has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nScopely will not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Scopely in accordance with these Terms in the six (6) months immediately preceding the date on which you first assert a claim.\nYou acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid anything to Scopely during such time period, your sole remedy (and Scopely\u2019s exclusive liability) for any dispute with Scopely is to stop using the Services and to cancel your Account.</p>\n<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages.\nAccordingly, some of the above disclaimers and limitations may not apply to you.\nTo the extent that Scopely may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any warranty or limit its liability as set forth herein, the scope of such warranty and the extent of Scopely\u2019s liability will be the minimum permitted under such applicable law.\nIn particular, nothing in these Terms will affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of Scopely.\nThis provision shall have no effect on the choice of law provision set

Services or goods or services obtained in connection therewith.\n(ii) any breach or violation of these Terms.\n(iii) our use of your User Content.\nor (iv) any breach of the representations, warranties, and covenants made by you herein.\nWe reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.\nWe will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such matter upon becoming aware of it.\nYou agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your Account(s) or of our Services.</p>\n<p>\n<b>9.\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION, GOVERNING LAW</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Informal Dispute Resolution</b>\n</p>\n<p>If a dispute arises between you and us, we prefer amicable resolution to protracted legal battles.\nTo that end, we have created an informal dispute resolution program we believe can resolve most matters.\nBefore initiating any arbitration or court proceeding, you must first exhaust these steps to resolution:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CHECK THE FAQ: You can start your resolution process by reviewing our \u201cHelp/FAQ\u201d section for the applicable game or Services.\nEach \u201cFAQ\u201d section is specific to each game, and addresses the most commonly asked questions or concerns players may have, so please start there.</li>\n<li>IN-GAME SUPPORT: If our FAQs did not resolve the issue, please complete a help ticket in-game, and be sure to clearly state your issue in the ticket.\nAll tickets are reviewed by our player care team, who will work with you to resolve the issue through the inbox message system in your Account.\nPlease bear with us.\nwe may need to research your issue to fully resolve the ticket, and this may require us to ask further questions and engage with you over several communications.\nAlthough most issues can be resolved in this way, certain issues may require further escalation, as reasonably determined by us.</li>\n<li>ESCALATION: If you\u2019ve followed the above steps, but you feel that the issue remains unresolved after our agents have stated that a matter is closed, please email us at&nbsp;privacy@scopely.com and include a reference to the help ticket and specific issue you believe is unresolved.\nOur player care leads will work with you further to resolve your issue.\nIn some cases, we may address the issue remotely.\nIn others, we may ask to speak with you directly and will arrange a mutual time to discuss your matter.\nIf you provide us with your phone number for this purpose, it will not be used for other purposes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\n<b>Arbitration Agreement</b>\n</p>\n<p>If your issue remains unresolved after you\u2019ve exhausted our informal dispute resolution system above, you may seek to resolve it through binding arbitration as follows:</p>\n<p>If you are a resident of the US or Canada, you and Scopely agree to resolve any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services on an individual basis through final and binding arbitration, provided you have exhausted the dispute resolution steps above and the dispute remains unresolved.\nThis agreement will preclude you from bringing any class action against Scopely.\nThis agreement applies to all kinds of claims under any legal theory, except those described in the Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate subsection.\nIt also applies even after you stop using your Account or have deleted it.\n</p>\n<p>An arbitration proceeding proceeds before a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge and jury, so&nbsp;we both agree to give up our right to a trial before a judge or jury.\nArbitration proceedings have different rules than lawsuits in court.\nArbitration is less formal, and provides limited opportunity to compel the other side to share information relevant to the dispute\u2014a process called discovery.\nThe arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.\nBut, if you or we do not like the arbitrator\u2019s decision, the courts only have a limited ability to change the outcome of arbitration or make the arbitrator reconsider his or her decision.\nIf we have a dispute about whether this agreement to arbitrate can be enforced or applies to our dispute, we all agree that the arbitrator will decide that too, rather than a court or other agency.\nUnless you and Scopely otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</b>\n</p>\n<p>We all agree that we each still have the right to go to court to resolve disputes relating to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Your or Scopely\u2019s intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights or patents).\nor</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Claims that are not subject to arbitration as a matter of applicable law not preempted by federal law, and that are within the jurisdiction of the court where they\u2019re brought.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>No Class Actions</b>\n<br>\nWe all agree that we can only bring claims against each other on an individual basis.</p>\n<p>That means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>Neither you nor Scopely can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ul>\n<li>The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person\u2019s claim into a single case, and cannot preside over any class, collective, consolidated, or representative arbitration proceeding (unless we both agree to change this).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The arbitrator\u2019s decision or award in one person\u2019s case can only impact the person who brought the claim, not other individuals, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other users.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<b>The Arbitration Process, Rules, and Governing Law</b>\n<br>\nThe American Arbitration Association (\u201c<b>AAA</b>\u201d) will run the arbitration between you and Scopely, in accordance with the AAA\u2019s rules and procedures then in effect (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) (\u201cAAA Rules\u201d), except as modified here.\nIf something in these Terms is different than the AAA Rules, then we will follow these Terms instead.\nTo review the AAA Rules or to start an arbitration proceeding, you can refer to AAA\u2019s website&nbsp;(www.adr.org)&nbsp;or you can call AAA at 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp;If either of us decide to initiate arbitration, we agree to provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules.</p>\n<p>You get to choose whether the arbitration will take place in the county or province where you live or in Los Angeles, California.\nWe could also hold the arbitration in some other place, but we both have to agree to that.\nWe also agree that during the arbitration process, members of our team may still work with you to resolve your issue informally.</p>\n<p>Either of us involved in the arbitration can ask the arbitrator to put his or her decision or award, or his or her reasons for the decision or award, in writing.\nAlso, either of us can take the arbitrator\u2019s decision or award to a court to confirm it or enter a judgment on it (i.e.,&nbsp;make it the same as a court judgment).\nSometimes you can ask a court to change an arbitrator\u2019s decision or award, but those circumstances are limited.</p>\n<p> Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provisions in these Terms, we all agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (including its procedural provisions) is the law that will be applied to determine whether the provisions in this Section 9 can be enforced and how they should be interpreted.</p>\n<p>\n<b>10.\nGENERAL PROVISIONS</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Severability</b>\n</p>\n<p>You and Scopely agree that if any portion of these Terms&nbsp;is found unlawful or unenforceable, in whole or in part, that provision will be ineffective only to the extent of such finding and as to such jurisdiction, without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Choice of Law</b>\n</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a US resident, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by California law, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles, except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement above.\nAs described in Section 9, the Federal Arbitration Act will apply to arbitrable disputes.\nIf you reside outside the US, these Terms and our relationship will be governed by English law, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Assignment</b>\n<br>\nScopely may assign or delegate these Terms, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your approval.\nYou may not assign and/or delegate any of the rights or obligations you have under the Terms unless you obtain Scopely\u2019s prior written approval.\n&nbsp;Any such assignment and/or delegation without Scopely\u2019s prior written approval is ineffective and in violation of these Terms.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Force Majeure</b>\n<br>\nWe will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside of our reasonable control, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or causes such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fires, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>\n<p>\n<b>Claims of Copyright Infringement</b>\n</p>\n<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the
