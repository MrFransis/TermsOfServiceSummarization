as of December 03, 2019.</p>\n<p>Last updated June 04, 2020</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of FaceApp in connection with the FaceApp mobile application (the \u201cApp\u201d) and FaceApp.com website (the \u201cSite\u201d).</p>\n<p>Welcome to FaceApp\u2019s Privacy Policy!</p>\n<p>If you decide not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we want you to walk away with a few key points about FaceApp\u2019s privacy practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The App is a photo and video editor that allows users to edit portraits based on neural network technology that automatically generates highly realistic facial transformations.</li>\n<li>We use third-party cloud providers \u2013 specifically, Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services \u2013 to process and edit photographs.</li>\n<li>The App only uploads to the cloud the photographs that you specifically select for editing.</li>\n<li>Photographs are temporarily cached on the cloud servers during the editing process, and encrypted using a key stored locally on your mobile device.</li>\n<li>Photographs remain in the cloud for a limited period of 24-48 hours after you have last edited the photograph, so that you can return to the image and make additional changes if you so choose.</li>\n<li>We do not use the photographs you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the portrait editing functionality of the App.</li>\n<li>Videos are edited locally on your device, so you don\u2019t provide us with videos when you use the App, and we don\u2019t collect, use and share your video information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please email privacy@faceapp.com.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s more on our privacy practices.\nIndividuals located in the European Economic Area should also read our Notice to European Users below.</p>Personal Information We Collect<p>When you use the App, we may collect information

collect your photo albums even if you grant us your access to them.\nWe encrypt each photograph that you upload using the App.\nThe encryption key is stored locally on your device.\nThis means that the only device that can view the photo is the device from which the photograph was uploaded using the App \u2013 the user\u2019s device.\nPlease note that while we do not require or request any metadata attached to the photographs you upload, metadata (including, for example, geotags) may be associated with your photographs by default.\nWe take steps to delete any metadata that may be

and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court.\nThis Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</p>\n<p>Arbitration Rules and Forum.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.\nTo begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent [include name and address of registered agent here].\nThe arbitration will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (\u201cJAMS\u201d), an established alternative dispute resolution provider.\nDisputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys\u2019 fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS\u2019s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available.\nall other disputes shall be subject to

www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.\nIf JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.\nIf the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, FaceApp will pay them for you.\nIn addition, we will reimburse all such JAMS\u2019s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.\nYou may choose to have the arbitration conduced by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\nAny judgment on the award rendered by the

and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.\nThe arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</p>\n<p>Waiver of Jury Trial.\nYOU AND FACEAPP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT

judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited.\nReview.</p>\n<p>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.\nALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND

MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.\nIf a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection\u2019s
