of Zapier, Inc.\n( \"Zapier\", \"we\", \"us\" and/or \"our\").\nThis Site is operated by Zapier and has been created to provide information about our company and its content and data linking platform and related services (together with the Site, the \"Service(s)\") to our Service visitors (\"you\", \"your\").\nThis Privacy Policy sets forth Zapier's policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (\"Personal Data\") and other information that is collected from visitors to the Site and Services.</p>Third-Party Service Integration<p>Our Service allows you to integrate and create commands for various online third-party services (\"Third-Party Services\").\nIn order to take advantage of this feature, you may need to authenticate, register for or log into Third-Party Services through the Service or on the websites of their respective providers.\nWhen you enable linking between or log in to Third-Party Services through the Service, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable the Service to access that Third-Party Service and your data and content contained within that Third-Party Service (\"Login Credentials\").\nWe store your Login Credentials long enough to enable linking to the Third-Party Service.</p>\n<p>When you enable the Service to link content and data between Third-Party Services, the Third-Party Services will provide us with access to certain information that you may have provided to the Third-Party Services, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the rules you set to govern the linking.\nIn addition, you can use the Service to share content and Personal Data amongst the Third-Party Services you integrate with the Service.\nPlease remember that the manner in which Third-Party Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such Third-Party Services, and Zapier shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Third-Party Services that may be enabled within the Service.</p>\n<p>We may retain certain personally non-identifiable information related to the data or content linked between Third-Party Services (for example, date sent, link configuration, names of the Third-Party Services), for the purpose of improving our Services and as described below in the \"Aggregated Personal Data\" section.</p>Third-Party Payment Processor<p>We use a third party payment processor to process payments made to us.\nIn connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers.\nRather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be viewed at https://stripe.com/us/privacy.</p>Information We Collect<p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services</strong>: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Zapier Services or use certain Zapier Services.\nWherever Zapier collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.\nYou can choose at any time to opt out by contacting support at contact@zapier.com, you can also contact us to opt out of your information being used for purposes other than it was originally collected.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Zapier and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.\nThe Personal Information that you provide can be accessed at any time through your account or you can contact our customer support at contact@zapier.com if you need help accessing your account.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Cookies</strong>: In operating the Services, we may use a technology called \"cookies.\" A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services.\nOur cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately.\nFor instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services.\nIn all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission.\nOn most web browsers, you will find a \"help\" section on the toolbar.\nPlease refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off.\nWe recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Services's features.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Aggregated Personal Data</strong>: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Zapier Services, Zapier often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us.\nThis research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Zapier may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners.\nThis aggregate information does not identify you personally.\nZapier may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We will keep any information that you provide to us until such time as you delete your account with the Zapier Service.</p>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information<p>Zapier will not sell or rent to any third party any of the personal information or data that you provide to us.\nZapier uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nIf you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided.\nFor instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.\nAlso, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Zapier Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.\nZapier and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the \"Zapier Related Companies\") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Zapier Services.\nZapier and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you.\nIf we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to \"opt-out\" of receiving future communications.\nIn addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>\n<p>If Zapier intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information<p>You can visit the Services without providing any Personal Data.\nIf you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Zapier Services.</p>\n<p>Zapier is not in the business of selling your information.\nWe consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.\nThere are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Business Transfers</strong>: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.\nIn the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.\nIn cases of onward transfer of personal information to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, Zapier remains liable.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n<strong>Related Companies</strong>: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n<strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</strong>: Zapier, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions.\nExamples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.\nWhen we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.\n<strong>Business Partners</strong>: If one of our business partners refers you to us, we may disclose Personal Data pursuant to our agreement with that business partner.\nWe do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners.\n<strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: Zapier may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Zapier, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>\n</blockquote>EU-U.S.\n&amp.\nSwiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield<p>Zapier complies with the EU-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.\nZapier has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.\nZapier is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.\nTo learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Zapier commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information.\nEU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact Zapier at: contact@zapier.com.</p>\n<p>Zapier has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to PrivacyTrust, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United Kingdom.\nIf you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact Communications House, 26 York Street, London, W1U 6PZ for more information or to file a complaint.\nThe services of Communications House are provided at no cost to you.</p>\n<p>Finally, as a last resort and in limited situations, EU and Swiss individuals may seek redress from the Privacy Shield Panel, a binding arbitration mechanism.\n</p>\n<p>In cases of onward transfer of personal information to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-U.S.\nand Swiss-U.S.\nPrivacy Shield, Zapier remains liable.</p>\n</blockquote>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)<p>To the extent provided for by law and subject to applicable exceptions, California
